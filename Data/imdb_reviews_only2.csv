review
"I have never watched a show that is as consistently genuine and engaging as Breaking Bad. This is undoubtedly one of the greatest shows ever, and it consistently improves as it progresses.

The Journeys of Walter White and Jesse Pinkman are unforgettable. These are some of the best-written characters to ever come from a pen-hitting paper.

My praises for the acting and cinematography are unending. Some of the shots are intricate works of art, and I was rarely distracted by the acting. The performances are excellent to the extent that it feels improper to refer to them as performances.

Overall, Breaking Bad consistently maintains a level of engagement and technical quality seen in only the best of movies, and in terms of tone, every intense moment is executed with excellence and always achieves the impact it reaches for.

I feel like the show's plot in the early seasons lacks a certain level of complexity due to it not having a vast amount of plot threads, and the start is a bit slow-paced, but Breaking Bad is an absolute must-watch. If you have mixed feelings towards Season 1, trust me, it is only uphill from there.

If there was ever a series you could call perfect, I think this might be it."
Re-Watched it 7 times and counting. I guess I liked it.
"One of the greatest shows ever, the pacing is excellent. The characters are well developed and entertaining. The show ties everything together very neatly. It's honestly a show that get's better each time you view it. It's cathartic to see Walter break bad and how the story unravels is the best way it could have. Very good storytelling, well done to Vince Gilligan."
I cannot stress enough how good this show is. I've watched a lot of TV in my life and this show still remains the best show I've ever seen.
"Breaking Bad is absolutely, without a doubt, one of the greatest tv shows ever created...it's damn near perfect! I know that people say that about a ton of different shows but Breaking Bad really is universally thought of as one of the greatest shows of all-time. All you have to do is go google ""greatest tv shows of all-time"" and I guarantee you that it's at or near the top of every list you'll find and there's a reason for that...because it is! Every season is just as brilliant as the others, which everyone knows is almost impossible for a show to do but one which Breaking Bad absolutely pulls off!! If you're one of the few people who still haven't seen this amazing show then do yourself a favor and go watch this immediately...you will not be disappointed!"
When you finish the show you'll never be the same..I guarantee you
Breaking Bad is every bit as good as everyone says it is. It's easily one of my favorites shows of all-time and one of the best shows in the history of television. Just read through the reviews and look at the 9.5 rating to see how loved this show really is. The writing and acting is what makes this show so special. I love this show so much that I've already watched it all the way through twice already and plan on doing so again sometime in the near future. There's nothing more I can say about this incredible show that hasn't already been said so just go watch it. But plan ahead to give yourself enough time because you're going to want to binge this as quickly as you can. It's addicting once you start!
I wanna delete my brain and watch it again like I never knew it.

Climax-PERFECT!!

Acting-BEYOND PERFECT!!

Overall-(as I said) ABSOLUTE PERFECTION."
"'Breaking Bad' is one of the most popular rated shows on IMDb, is one of those rarities where every season has either been very positively received or near-universally acclaimed critically and where all of my friends have said nothing but great things about.

Very few shows in recent memory had me so hooked from the very start that before the week was over the whole show had been watched, especially when for a lot of shows now airing watching one episode all the way through can be an endeavour. 'Breaking Bad' had that effect on me, and its reputation as one of the best, consistently brilliant and most addictive shows in many years (maybe even ever) is more than deserved in my eyes. Its weakest season is perhaps the first season, understandable as any show's first season is the one where things are still settling.

Actually everything is established remarkably from the very start, but once the writing and characterisation becomes even meatier the show reaches even higher levels.

Visually, 'Breaking Bad' is one of those shows that is both stylish and beautiful, with photography and editing that are cinematic quality and put a lot of films today to shame, where there are a lot of visually beautiful ones but also some painfully amateurish looking ones. The music always has the appropriate mood, never too intrusive, never too muted.

The writing for 'Breaking Bad' is a fine example to all shows of how to have a lot of style but also to have a lot of substance. The dialogue throughout is thought-provoking and tense, while also have a darkly wicked sense of humour and heart-tugging pathos. The stories are texturally rich, intimate, tense and layered, with the pace of them consistently deliberate but taut. The direction couldn't be better.

Can't say anything bad about the acting. Bryan Cranston is phenomenal as one of the most fascinating anti-heroes, or even of any kind of character, in either film or television. Aaron Paul has never been better and Anna Gunn is affecting. The characters are compelling in their realism.

Overall, describing it as brilliant doesn't do 'Breaking Bad' justice. 10/10 Bethany Cox"
"In 29/9 and same time this Date is Final Episode Day ( Filena ) This is The Best Tv Show I have ever had season one a little slow like season two and season three but seasons four, Season Five Was Perfect Very Good Character have in this TV Show Like Walter White, Giancarlo Esposito, Mike, Hank And Jesse I Love All Of Them What'a Story Breaking Bad in My Heart And Stay in My Brain Forever I Will Miss This Tv Show Coming Soon But The Good Point is I'm not saw Better Call Saul Next Up is Better Call Saul I'm Happy to See The Best TV Show Ever This Date For My Is Very Special 29 9 2024 At 5:30AM I Awake To Watch Filena Final Episode Thank You Breaking Bad I Love You."
I heard that this show was so good. I wonder what other people were watching. So far I am just trying to stay awake during the first season. The show moves so slow and I keep hoping that it would pick up. I already can't stand Walt's wife and I would like to kill her off. Jesse is worthless. Walt is doing some stupid things. I don't think I can continue watching this mess of a show.
"I have never watched any series which depicts emotions so exactly through camera angles, dialogues, screen play, perfect story line other than ""Breaking Bad"". We all are lucky enough to be born to watch series like this. Teaches us loyalty, family love, pain and many more things.

More than anything this series teaches people to live life the different way and changes people mindset towarss life.

There are scenes which will stay with you forever after this series and it will change the way you watch TV Series and life for that matter.

I don't think I will ever see any series which will be better than this.

Perfection!"
"Breaking Bad feels like fever dream. A really REALLY good fever dream. The directing is absolutely perfect. The characters bounce off each other in this really well done way. I can really feel the true emotion and pure character coming from each one. I can feel the greed, lust, money hunger animals each of these characters are. There are no true heroes in this story (except hank I love u)."
"If you are among the few who haven't seen it yet: believe the hype, it really is THAT good. Breaking Bad may not depict reality the way 'Generation Kill' or 'The Wire' did - but then it's not about that, either. From an artistic point of view - performances, writing, direction, camera, music - this show is every bit as good as the other two mentioned above, but unlike those, 'Breaking Bad' just wants to entertain and therefore enjoys a lot more creative freedom.

The show plays like the daydream fantasy of any underachieving, struggling middle class family man who's had to bury all his dreams (I mean: who wouldn't want to be a meth-kingpin for a little while?), before it turns into a nightmare. One could almost say that 'Heisenberg' is Walter White's 'Tyler Durden'(for those who don't get the reference: watch 'Fight Club' - you won't regret it).

For pure entertainment value, this is simply the best show I've ever seen. Every single one of the main characters has already reached the status of a screen icon - when does that ever happen?! Most fun I've ever had watching a TV-show and an instant classic."
"Nothing compares. Nothing comes close.

I may currently be on my 20th dose of this show and it's still as addictive and beautiful as the first time."
"I was waiting to see how GOT ended. It should be the greatest but they failed miserably in the finale season especially the last 3 (mainly the finale) episode.

Writers need to take notes and be more like breaking bad. They had they ending planned out from the begging. They didn't try and build a massive brand or following behind the show and extend their seasons to do so. They stuck with their plan and created the greatest show we may ever see.

Thank you for existing."
"If there is any show deserves a 10/10, it's Breaking Bad, Simply the greatest."
"I usually don't comment on here but this show is the best I've seen in my life. And I've seen a lot of shows. The setting, character development and the actors... everything is pitch perfect. I'm on my fourth run through this show and I still love it. There's no other show out there I can watch this many times and still be excited. The dynamic between Walter and Jesse is awesome. I will watch this show once a year and I never get bored. Forget about the hyped shows you'll only watch once. This is the one and only you should watch right now If you haven't already. The only show that got me this excited in the last decade was Dark.

Just look at the rating for breaking bad and you'll know what's up. Not many shows can hold up this rating for so long."
"I watched the first three seasons of Breaking Bad.

I liked the series, although it is much more flawed than I expected.

What I liked:

excellent cast and chemistry between the lead actors - refreshing take on drug crime genre - some very funny moments


What I disliked: - too many lengthy parts - often we're caught in really boring everyday drudgery that the producers apparently didn't have the heart to cut out - too many incongruent parts over time - the character development is weak and made me want to switch off after a while. I kept watching purely for the quality of the actors (who make up for it somewhat) - way too many clichés - too much repetition - some characters become irritating after a while, because they lack real growth (e.g. Skyler)"
"I resisted watching this show while it was on air. I hate things that are hyped because they tend to be let downs.I suffered through the first two season and said that was enough of my life I was willing to give to Mr. White and his do-boy Pinkman. I just didn't get what was so sensational about this show revolving around a middle age white guy who decides to make meth. The character development was so weak I didn't care or root for anyone and I didn't understand Walt's desperate desire to leave money for his family who were two-dimensional and whinny. What was extremely annoying was the dragging out of things out over multiple episodes. Case in point, Crazy 8. Did his act really require 3 episodes?? That time could've been better spent trying to establish a legitimate connect. No we have to watch these clowns bumble their way into the drug business, which Pinkman was already firmly entrenched, for darn near nine episodes. Put a fork in me, I'm breaking bad and not giving this overrated show anymore of my time."
"I probably haven't been hooked to a TV show like I am to Breaking Bad before. This beautiful piece of art is incredibly well written and directed, furthermore the actors are doing a tremendous job! I've read a few remarks about the pace of the show, saying it is too slow. I completely disagree, there are so many aspects which get their place in the series, every single one in its own way and it would be horrible if we'd see a too fast paced show containing ridiculous cliffhangers like we see them on the major networks. Because this way you can entirely fall in love with the show, the characters and every tiny detail of the story and the best part of it, it is unbelievably addictive and makes you starve for more week after week!

10/10

Kudos to Mr. Gilligan, kudos to Mr. Cranston and kudos to everyone else who's making a contribution to this show!"
"Till season 7 very likely the best TV show ever made in terms of suspense, character development, plot, effects, acting.... 10/10 with no doubt! But S6E10 is probably the point where you should stop and imagine your own ending. It is guaranteed better and has more character development. Otherwise you may end up rating it down by more than just one and are overcome by disappointment..."
"It was a master piece. It was written to the perfection. It was mesmerizing. It was gripping. It was so shocking that if someone is binge watching this show he/she will need a time-off in between to get their head around things and accept some messed up, yet mind blowing development.

But yet, I cant hate it enough after final season. Its like you came to know that you were in love with the wrong one all along. It was like looking at a completely different person. It was like seeing your own dreams and expectations get destroyed. It was not a let down, it was a BETRAYAL!"
"Let's say you're reading these reviews and haven't watched GoT yet, but now that it's finished are considering the marathon. What's the consensus? In this case, the consensus is accurate, and that is:

Seasons 1-6: outstanding. Deep world-building, intelligent dialogue, epic set-pieces worthy of Hollywood, expert acting, detailed plotting, genuine surprises, great soundtrack used sparingly. GoT is worth watching for these seasons, definitely.

Season 7: you suddenly notice the writing and plotting has taken a sharp dive downwards in quality. There are inexplicable ideas, inconsistent characterisation and soap-opera dramas. But at least the entertainment value is still very high, so it gets a pass.

Season 8: this drop chasms down to depths you didn't think possible. The writing has got so amateurish that the still-fantastic production values are no longer enough to save it. If you ever enjoyed Lost but were amazed at how bad the final season was, you're in familiar territory here.

The biggest problem with the final season was it took us out of the story and got us thinking about its many weaknesses. We lost our suspension of disbelief. Fatal for fiction. It also ruined the series-arcs to the point where a rewatch of the entire series is pointless.

So can I recommend a GoT marathon for newcomers? Yes, the first 6 seasons are worth the disappointments later on. But best series of all time it is not. It could've been, but dropping the ball in the final stretch puts it behind the following superior series more worthy of your marathon:"
"I'm feeling so heartbroken to see everyone criticising my favourite show of all time. And yes of course that's because of the bad making of the season finale, I can totally understand that. After all these years hardwork, creating and developing each and every character from bottom to top, memories, emotions throughout the process all went to vain for one bad making. It's so painful to accept it for the audience who invested lots of time watching the show from the starting and then finishing it like this! It's a long long journey. I don't even remember the day I started watching it and since then I waited the next year to come for the new season. I can't say anything more. Only one last request, could you please delete the whole season 8 and make a new version of it? Please?"
"As we prepare for the House of the Dragon, we look back on the brilliance that once was Game of Thrones. Seasons 1-6 are truly outstanding television, right up there with The Sopranos, Breaking Bad, Mad Men, The Wire, best of the best. Season 7 was a drop in quality but still somewhat enjoyable, and then came Season 8 which was a blunder of epic proportions. A Rushed, botched, lazy ending and a slap in the face to both new and old fans alike.

That being said, nothing can take away from the wild, brilliant, emotional ride that is Game of Thrones seasons 1-6, a television show that defined a decade and changed pop culture forever. I like to believe that it was cancelled after Season 6 and we never get to see the true ending ;)"
"Game of Thrones boasts an intricate plot with complex characters, stunning cinematography, and intense action sequences, especially its many battles and fights. It's hard to deny that it wasn't a cultural phenomenon that captivated me and many others for eight seasons.

I've rated Game of Thrones a nine out of ten for its well-written and multi-layered storytelling, and its fantastic production value. However, despite still having amazing visuals and extremely high production value, like many fans, I was disappointed and to an extent frustrated by the final season's storytelling and how certain plot points were handled, which has lowered my rating from a ten to a nine. Despite this, Game of Thrones still remains for me a must-watch series and I would still highly recommend it to any fan of the fantasy or drama genre in general."
"The end ruined it all for me. It reminds me of lost, you can't judge it anymore without thinking of the ending and I wouldn't recommend it to my friends knowing how bad they handled it in the end. Wow just, wow I don't regret the ride, but I have never seen such a good show fall apart like this. I guess the checks have been cashed who cares about artistic integrity"
"You know a lot people say this about a ton of different shows but Game of Thrones is absolutely, without a doubt, one of the best TV shows ever created...it's damn near perfect (except for maybe the last few episodes of the last season) and easily one of my all-time favorite shows! Yeah, the last few episodes of Season 8 weren't that good and the ending was just awful but the first 7 1/2 seasons were so amazing that it still gets a 10 from me! It's one of the rare shows where I can watch it all the way from the first episode to the last and never get bored. I'm pretty sure there's never been a show more talked about or more loved in the history of television than GOT. All you have to do is read through the reviews to see how loved this show really is! It's absolutely amazing."
"Was over-time on a gradual binge of watching 'Game of Thrones' from the first episode (gradual because of being so busy), having heard nothing but amazing things about it from friends, family and IMDb reviewers. Plus with such a great cast of talent and a brilliant book series, how could it possibly go wrong?

The good news is that 'Game of Thrones' didn't go wrong. Quite the opposite. Not only is it a rare television show that does its original source material justice and treats it with respect but it is on its own merits one of the finest, most addictive and consistently compelling shows in recent years. A television show so brilliant that one has to actually check that it was made for television when everything is done to such a high level that it puts many films made today to shame. This is one of the strongest examples of an acclaimed show that deserves every ounce of the praise it's garnered.

Visually, 'Game of Thrones' looks amazing. The scenery is throughout spectacular, the sets are hugely atmospheric and beautiful on the eyes with a real meticulous eye for detail and the costumes suit the characters to a tee. Then there are the special effects that are some of the best of any television programme and are not overused or abused, the scale, the detail and how they actually have character and soul are better than those in a lot of the big-budget blockbusters. As well the cinematography and editing, which are cinematic quality as well.

One cannot talk about 'Game of Thrones' without mentioning the thematically, orchestrally and atmospherically multi-layered music scoring and the unforgettable main theme. Again, worthy of a high-budget fantasy/action/drama film.

It is hard not to be bowled over by the quality of the writing, outstanding isn't a strong enough adjective to describe how good the writing is. It always has a natural flow, is layered and thought-provoking and demonstrates a wide range of emotions such as suspenseful tension, poignant pathos and witty humour. The story-lines are paced so beautifully, structured with such nuance and attention to coherence, a high emotional level and touch upon complex and sensitive themes with intelligence and tact.

Whenever there's a set-piece or more action-oriented scene there's always a reason, never there for the sake of it. Not only are the set-pieces done with a lot epic scale, superb staging, excitement and dramatic tension but underneath all the scale and flashy attention to detail there is a lot of heart and a multi-layered one. They're not overlong, nor are there out of place elements.

Characters are a huge part of the appeal too. 'Game of Thrones' has characters that are so well developed and as close to real life as one can get despite being in a fantasy world. These characters are not hero and villain archetypes (Joffrey is the only one close to that, the difference though is that he is an extremely interesting one with a lot of development who ranks well beyond one hundred percent on the threat level scale), they have much more to them and have strengths and flaws. Decisions are logical and one doesn't like any character any less when a decision is not the right one because mistakes are acknowledged and learnt from.

'Game of Thrones' cast is full of talented names and, thanks to so well rounded characters and such great writing, nothing but the very best is gotten out of them. Even those who are not favourites of mine. Big acting standouts are Peter Dinklage, Sean Bean, Lena Headey and Jack Gleeson (Joffrey being the king of all young characters with not a redeeming bone in their body).

In conclusion, absolutely outstanding and a rare television show worthy of being a cinematic modern classic. This review may sound superlatively hyperbolic, but to me 'Game of Thrones' is that good. 10/10 Bethany Cox"
"So imagine you go into an ice cream shop and you order a sundae. They've got all kinds of nice stuff going on, beautiful delicious soft serve vanilla bean ice cream, some hot fudge, freshly cracked up peanuts, woah what is that?? A brownie? Some delicious house made whipped cream... Man this sundae is gonna be spectacular. Wow what more could you ask for? Cherry on top? Bring it on!!

And then all of a sudden they put an anchovy on top, and then another, and then a couple more, and then squirt some Dijon mustard on for good measure.

You don't even want the sundae anymore, in fact, you can't even look back on how nice that sundae used to be without thinking about all the stupid s*** they did at the very end just when it was going so well.

That's essentially Game of Thrones. I tried to rewatch it, but as I got through the first season I began looking at where all the pieces land at the end it's literally impossible to go back to. There are just so many ruined character arcs, so much pointlessness, and every time I come back here I drop it one more star it seems like. Game of Thrones is a beautiful anchovy sundae."
"What can be said about Game of Thrones that hasn't already been said? It's universally thought of as one of the best series in the history of television. Look up any ""best shows ever"" list and I promise you'll find Game of Thrones near the top of every list you'll find. Obviously everyone knows the last episode was absolutely awful, even most of the actors have come out and said they didn't like it. Having said that, it doesn't take away from the show being amazing. One bad show doesn't take away from the other 72 episodes that were almost perfect! I've watched the entire series all the way through twice now and if anything I just appreciate this show even more."
"This is the first series i would recommend to anybody , it is an amazing piece of work , the most stunning TV series you will ever watch. Why i gave it 9/10 because of the last season, it's still good but very disappointing compared to all the seasons. YOU will enjoy every episode"
"Season 1-4 were practically perfect, there is not much to say. It had so many great moments, so many great episodes there. But then... well the writers kinda ran out of books to adapt. Season 5 and 6 were pretty boring most of the time. But they truly had their moments even having some of the best episodes of the show. Season 7 you could really see the dip in quality. Everything just felt so rushed most of it was really stupid. And then ofc. Season 8 the biggest disapointment I have ever seen. I have never seen anything more terrible. The ending was the stupidest thing i have ever seen. All of the characters were just so stupid. Everything felt even more rushed. And all the characters were basically ruined because of the writing. Overall i still give it a 9/10 just because of the first half of the show. And ofc it did still have its moments. I would still consider this show a masterpiece and I would 100% recomend. It is truly a must watch show."
A series like never seen before which rocked last season on a flop! congratulations anyway
"I loved this series so much. Then came season 8 episode 3 and 4. Such a disgraceful ending.

Seasons 1-4 10/10 Seasons 5-7 9/10 Season 8 (Ep 1-4) 3/10"
"Started off as the greatest series of all time, but had the worst ending of all time."
"As an avid reader, I am often disappointed by what is represented by the silver screen. I initially get excited to see one of my favorite series on the big screen, and eventually walk away disgusted. For whatever reason, most shows and movies that are based on epic book series absolutely butcher the original content.

So when I saw the preview for ""Game of Thrones"" on HBO, I was immediately skeptical. Oh, I was going to watch it, but I didn't have high expectations. I did hold a little hope because HBO is known for their high quality shows.

I was absolutely shocked to watch the Pilot and realize that it followed the book almost to perfection. The language that is used by the actors is very similar to the way that it was written in the book, and events were not skipped. It stayed very true to the story without adding to it or removing from it.

The acting is superb and I actually felt like I was looking into Winterfell for the first time. I feel like I've actually got faces to add to the characters that I've been reading about for a long time.

If you have not read the books, you may feel as though the blatant sexuality is an addition from HBO to add some spice to the series. This is not the case at all. The books contained all of the sexuality that is shown in the Pilot. I am very proud of HBO for producing an amazingly accurate product. I will be watching every week for sure.

If you enjoyed what you saw in the Pilot, know that there are many other plot twists and action filled evenings to come. ""Game of Thrones"" has a ton of potential to be one of the greatest series that has ever been produced. I would highly recommend it to fans of the series and newcomers alike.

UPDATE:

I have now watched 3 Episodes and I wanted to come back and report some more. Even after 3 Episodes, the series is staying true to the written story. Overall the acting is still very good. I hate to watch a show that makes it look like the actors are reading a script. I don't get this impression with this HBO adaptation.

Each episode of this series leaves me itching for the next weekend. I really hate watching shows in real time because I enjoy absorbing several hours of a show at one time. But, a good show will keep you looking forward to it the whole week.

A special note to viewers that have not read the books... Keep watching! This series has numerous twists and turns and full of epic battles and action. It may seem like it's taking a little while to develop, but the reward is well worth the wait.

Even after 3 episodes, I would still highly recommend this to anyone."
"Do not believe any of those negative reviews. I honestly cannot understand why some reviewers have given this such a low rating. I think some people love the sound of their own voice and think their opinion is worth something and will be disagreeable simply for the sake of it.

Having said that, this show is stunning. I have never read the books and now I want to. There is so much crap on TV that is renewed year after year (CSI, House etc.) which uses cheap gags, pointless and sometimes ridiculous plots, unbelievable and many times one dimensional characters and yet all the truly great shows get cancelled.

There is enough brain-dead television. But once in a while a show comes along that transports you to another world and makes you believe in the magic of television again. Game of Thrones is one such show.

It is complex, multi-layered, surreal, vibrant, imaginative and it draws your eye in to the surprising level of detail, from the sweeping vistas, to the narrow dungeons, from the beautiful castles and magnificent trees, to the contrasting landscapes. It is worth watching just for the scenery alone.

Yes the acting seems a little cold and even wooden at times, but this is perfectly in keeping with the medieval look and feel of the show. Yes it is dark and gloomy, but again in keeping with the narrative.

The scripting is intelligent and well delivered by competent acting, led by Sean Bean perfectly cast as Lord Edard. Although Sean Bean is better known for brooding bad guys, he strikes the perfect balance between father, husband and Lord and soldier. He is well supported by other well known actors and many new to the scene.

After watching and sometimes enjoying Camelot, this show makes that one look more like ""Merlin"" by comparison. And where Camelot lacks in depth and scripting, Game of Thrones strikes the perfect balance between brooding medieval angst and wonderful fantasy story telling.

Even if you have never watched a fantasy show before, you should not miss this."
"At first I did not want to watch the series. But once I started watching it, I couldn't stop. It became more and more exciting from season 1-8.

Great actors.

I was disappointed with the end of the 8 season!"
"I finally watched The Mandalorian after putting it off for so long and I absolutely loved it! I don't consider myself to be a huge Star Wars superfan like some of these other fans out there but I am a regular fan that really enjoys watching the movies. I even didn't mind the latest trilogy, Rogue One and Solo more than most but The Mandalorian is without a doubt the best thing Star Wars related since the original trilogy! Jon Favreau is mostly known as an actor but he's also such an underrated Director, he's done some amazing movies (Iron Man, Iron Man 2, Elf, Swingers, Made, Cowboys & Aliens, The Jungle Book, etc.). I've really enjoyed it and can't wait for more to come."
The Mandalorian is every bit as good as everyone says it is. It's easily the best thing Star Wars has done since the original trilogy. Every episode of every season has been good so far. Jon Favreau definitely hit a home run with this. The Mandalorian is about a lone gunfighter who makes his way through the galaxy after the fall of the empire. He then comes across a baby Yoda who he pretty much adopts and brings along through all these adventures. This is the show every Star Wars fan has been waiting for. It just goes to show that they can still make good content when they want. Every episode is action packed. It will hook you from the beginning and you'll want to binge it a fast as possible. It's a must watch for any Star Wars fan.
"This is the Star Wars atmosphere and feeling I've been waiting for. No dumb humor, cool characters, and a story I can take seriously. I'm a big fan of what they've done with this series so far and current Star Wars filmmakers need to take notes. The cinematography is amazing. You can tell they use practicality as much as possible and CGI is used only for the obvious like spaceships and creatures etc. It's a truly remarkable balance of old and new."
"It's one thing to bring back elements, characters, settings and stories, and to flash them in front of the audience to cash in on the nostalgia and/or recognisable memorabilia but without using it to further the plot and other to do exactly the opposite. It was about time that Star Wars directives understood that it is too unique a product to be lend to corporate filmmakers. Star Wars needs to be understood and its uniqueness has to be acknowledged in order to make the new stories feel like they belong. This may sound too obvious but if you ever wondered why the new SW movies are so controversial this may be the reason.

Like with ""Spider-Man: Into the Spider-verse (2018)"" and their comicbook-industry experts participation, the creators behind The Mandalorian were experts of the industry, connoisseurs of the Star Wars Universe and even long time fans. So they were able to not only recapture the aesthetic of the grimy, battered Star Wars but also build upon it taking the most ""subtle"" things into account. Things like the predominancy of puppets and practical effects over CGI, settings you can feel and touch over green screens and the abundancy of not only known elements previously seen in Star Wars, but a whole batch of new creatures, designs and overall plot elements that felt like they belong to this universe and had always been there.

Exceeding expectations are not only the visual aspects but the narrative too. It might be too late for some story elements now, but it is of great importance that from now on you try to watch the unraveling of the story unspoiled. I was lucky to have seen the premiere of the show before the ""memefication"" of a certain ""element"" that went viral and became one of the biggest highlights of the show. But for me I saw the reveal of this element unspoiled and I was pleasantly shocked, a memory I'll always carry with me. The ability of these creators to generate such shock value and deep moments it's often baffling to me. This is proof that the creators behind the narrative are fully aware of the complexities of the universe they are tampering with and like an experienced surgeon, they are able to tweak, traverse and call back any Star Wars element as they please and with astonishing results.

It seems to be obvious that series creator Jon Favreau turns to gold everything he touches, from his influence in the MCU with the first Iron Man (2008) movie (still regarded today as a favorite among the infinite Marvel movies) to the remarkable and commercially successful live-action Jungle Book and Lion King Disney movies. He seems to understand how to treat a franchise not by exploiting the nostalgia aspects but rather use them to fuel new stories and ""revive"" the experience. Not to mention the contributors to this amazing show hype up the expectations and the quality of the show, from beloved names like Taika Watiti to legendary Star Wars showrunner Dave Filoni. The show today is in the most capable hands possible and away from the corporate meddling of Kathleen Kennedy.

Despite everything it does right, I have found some things that distanced me from it. It is merely one small and almost inevitable aspect I don't think a huge lore such as Star Wars can escape from. Something that makes the world-building so real: the subtle callbacks and references found on names and other elements. This is an aspect that non-Star Wars Lore fans (in which I have to identify myself as even though I have read and know some of the deeper lore) will not like or get as they are cast aside for not picking up or straight up know these references. If people don't know what a Gungan is they won't get the ""you are as ugly as a Gungan"" joke, for instance. But as for the rest, the story can be followed and understood because it feels self-contained and you don't need to know much about the SW status quo at the time other than (in simplified terms) an Empire ruled over the galaxy and now it's over, in this world there are mercenaries that adhere to a code among themselves, there's a magical energy flowing through all of us called The Force, there's a group of Force-wielding knights that fight with light swords, and that's about it. Anything else you need to know it is presented in the story or explained through exposition, which in a huge universe that is Star Wars it is a must in order to be able to tell a story worthy of SW.

As for the show itself, these are some of the most predominant reasons why The Mandalorian gets Star Wars right (reasons I believe stand out among many others the show has) -- WARNING: MILD MILD SPOILERS AHEAD OF SEASON 1:







END OF SPOILERY STUFF --

IN CONCLUSION, The Mandalorian is a worthy sequel to the OT, maintaining the same aesthetic, themes and recognisable elements but providing new and incredible ideas that amount to the incredible universe that is Star Wars. If they are able to keep it up it'll become one of the best SW media to come in its history. Disney Star Wars seems to know what it's doing now after stumbling a couple of time and I commend them for it. SW isn't an easy franchise to expand and continue despite the amount of stories that are left to be told. You know the saying ""Nobody hates Star Wars more than Star Wars fans"". But I praise the work done by everyone involved...

... This is the way."
Jon Favreau should be in charge of all future Star Wars projects. It's exactly how it should be. I will not give 10 stars because nothing is perfect but this is very very close. Hats off!
"What an incredible leap into Live Action Star Wars television. The Mandalorian delivers in both capturing the feel of the classic trilogy as well as it's own unique identity. A sweet spot of western/ sci fi/ action and comedy. Many Star Wars fans have experienced the expertly crafted stories by Filoni in series like ""The Clone Wars"" and ""Rebels"". His influence shines bright in The Mandalorian and I believe Star Wars fans will be absolutely thrilled to see his expertise once again bring excitement and wonder back to a Galaxy Far Far Away."
Jon Favreau did a fantastic job here. Beautiful and well crafted series that binds nicely in the star wars story and gives more depth to it. 10/10 Highly recommended.
"This show is such a refreshing breeze of great quality Star Wars. Hopefully with Episode 9, this horrible era of Star Wars will end, and we will finally get what we all wanted the whole time - great stories set in the Star Wars universe. Stories like this, that make sense. Stories that hook us and make us want more, make us relate to the characters on the screen, just by showing their weaknesses along with their strengths. The Mandalorian has faced more adversity in these two episodes than Rey has in two three hour movies. Definitely my favorite character of the Disney Star Wars era, and he has only said a few lines. Brilliant directing, brilliant script, brilliant execution of everything. I can't wait to see where the story goes.

John Favreau you have my gratitude and respect!"
"Finally, this feels like the Star Wars universe. The cinematography, the atmosphere, the story line, wow! My only negative is, the episodes are too short."
"This is Star Wars. It feels like Star Wars. It Looks Like Star Wars. Why is this such a tough concept for the geniuses associated with the films to get? No subversion's needed, no forced 8 yr old humor, no political agenda. Just make it look and feel like the original Star Wars trilogy and fans will be happy, its literally that simple."
"I like that they gave the Mandalorian some personality, some good vistas and action setpieces, solid comedy, fun little additions to the Star Wars canon (bounty droids are officially awesome) and a general sense of adventure that I dig. It's all very small and big at the same time. All good stuff and I hope they can keep it up.

I especially appreciate the fact they employed the services of Carl Weathers"
"Here's my updated review after the conclusion of season 3.

Season 3 was mediocre in my opinion. I think my outlook on Star Wars projects has changed since I watched Andor. Most things have paled in comparison to the magnificence of that show.

Seasons 1 and 2 weren't perfect by any stretch of the imagination, but they were still very entertaining. The latter was entertaining as well, but I probably won't ever watch the episodes again because they aren't too groundbreaking.

Season 1 was a mostly down to earth weekly bounty hunter show. It was a solid start.

Season 2 had some cool cameos that mostly worked for the progression. It was great.

Season 3 saw a great fall in quality. It was disjointed and flawed. Not terrible, but disappointing.

If there is a season 4 I hope it can give us a compelling finish. M."
"Watching the last episode. Had to take a break, the writing is so sloppy and so so bad. So predictable. Very disappointed in favreau and his team. Sometimes I wonder if they got their children to write the script. Almost every scene I find myself bewildered at why characters aren't using what little brain cells they have. Other than bo katan there is no character development, it's more like character deterioration! Even Bo Katan's story is very weak and feels forced at times. The choreography is also terrible throughout the season.

They are very fortunate to have an endless budget that gave us stunning visuals. Because there's not much else to praise this season.

After this season I'm left feeling as though they stopped caring and started collected the paycheques. :( Still can't believe how much worse this season is compared to s1/s2. S1 9/10, s2 8/10, s3 5.5/10( would be much lower without the beautiful visuals)"
"A new chapter for Star-Wars, one like we haven't seen before. First of all, you can feel the star wars vibe from a mile away. The beautiful world-building production- and costumedesign, the thrilling cinematography and the great (sound)editing. There are however some aspects that divide this artwork from the trilogies. the type of storytelling for example. focusing completely on one character, and making this one character so interesting.

With a great cast and great producers, I have high hopes for this little show. Thanks in advantage, Mr. Favreau."
"This is the closest in FEEL we've ever gotten to the originals. The first episode captured the vision i had as child, lying in bed, reading about bounty hunters and the sleazy underground they operated in. All the while making up my story of how I was too sick to go to school, just so I could stay home and get lost in the universe laid before me. I really feel like I was watching an expanded universe book come to life! I can't think of how they could have pulled this off better! Hats off to Jon Favreau for his true understanding of star wars, and Dave Filoni for setting the tone of the series in such a perfect way. My childhood thanks you!"
"The Mandalorian (so far) has everything anyone could ask for. It is SO well-crafted, I have yet to see one flaw in it.

Pedro Pascal (is it really him under that mask 100% of the time?) is fantastic as the imperturbable, or so it would seem, outer-space tough guy bounty hunter with a soft, heart-of-gold, and a helmet that into the third episode, still does not budge. We know it's coming though, don't we, and waiting, is a small fraction of the fun. At least it is for me.

While it is somewhat on the side of slow-paced vs. fast-paced, in my opinion that just adds to the appeal. You can savor the onscreen antics, action and dialogue, while knowing more is coming. Actually, you find it kind of exquisite in its pacing. I literally dare you to look away. Not because you think you'll miss anything, but because even at its steady pace, you won't want to. Speaking of which, the visuals are quite impressive. The entire thing IS a Lucas Star Wars landscape. At no time can anyone see a 1-minute clip of The Manadalorian without knowing immediately that it belongs to the Star Wars universe. The twist, is that thrown into this universe now, is this strong proverbial cowboy of few words, who carries a big stick.

I'm a fan, and can hardly wait for more episodes."
"Easily the best thing Disney Star Wars has produced, and my faith in Disney Star Wars has been restored. Great job on this one Disney!! And on a side note, I think Jon Favreau oughta be running Disney Star Wars instead of Kathleen Kennedy because he actually understands how to capture the essence of Star Wars."
"I'm a huge Star Wars fan but I have to admit, all hope was beginning to be lost. I was excited for The Mandalorian but had my bar set very low. But my God man this is amazing! I can't believe it's this good! The OG Star Wars vibes are crazy! It's like they took the original Star Wars and buffed it with modern day big budget CGI without making it a crappy blockbuster. The story is actually incredible so far and every episode is better than the last. I was gonna just watch these online but I've gotta support Disney+ for finally allowing something good to come out of them owning Star Wars. Thanks Jon Favreau, this is the way."
"There's not much to say here... it's a great show, with solid acting, great cast, a script that dives into SW lore, superb fx (both pratical and digital) which leads to a real SW atmosphere (which lacks in the last movie trilogy). I'm a long time SW fan and you can say that the new trilogy brought new stuff into the franchise, blablabla... but no, the trilogy is a pain in the ass to watch indeed. So, instead, watch The Mandalorian, it's way much better in so many ways."
"Right, well yeah, I grew up on ""Star Wars"" and have been loving it ever since ""Star Wars Episode 4: A New Hope"", and I am still loving it today. So when ""The Mandalorian"" was announced, I was thrilled.

And now having sat through the entire first season, I must say that I am impressed and I am entertained, and I am enjoying this tremendously. Creator Jon Favreau is definitely on to something here with this series; something that is as close to the original trilogy as it can be. And man, this is phenomenal.

The storyline is interesting and has a good variety to it, so there is something for everybody, ranging from classic ""Star Wars"" action in terms of duels, gunfights, space combat, and such - you know what I mean here.

And ""The Mandalorian"" offers a nice insight into the term of being a Mandalorian, as they have been fairly poorly portrayed for the average public and casual viewers, anyone not well-traversed in the universe of ""Star Wars"". I mean, this show made one of my friends come up and say to me, 'I thought Mandalorians were evil, but it is a way of living, a mentality, a creed'.

The special effects in this TV series is good, but as if there ever were any doubts with Lucasfilm and Disney being behind the project. And it has that classic ""Star Wars"" feel to it, but with an added multiple layers. They managed to make it a tad more gritty and also have that classic Western feel to it. And it works marvelously in favor of the series.

As for the main character, the Mandalorian, aka Dyn Jarren, well he is interesting, and there are some really nice qualities and touches to the character, and I must say that Pedro Pascal portrays the helmet main character quite well. While he is the main character, there is no doubt about the fact that the child - as the public dubbed 'baby Yoda' - has stolen the show. And what is not to like? He is so awesome, cute and he wields The Force. I liked the child from the very first time we saw him on the screen, and with each episode my liking has just grown and grown.

""The Mandalorian"" plays on all the right buttons for a fan of the ""Star Wars"" universe, especially when they brought stormtroopers, scout troopers, death troopers and the TIE fighter into the series. That just felt right; it felt like coming home.

Now, the series is not carried by Pedro Pascal alone, there are some nice acting performances by the likes of Carl Weathers, Werner Herzog, Gina Carano and Nick Nolte, to mention the most prominent of performers. They have a great cast, and people perform quite well, bringing the characters to life in this rich and vibrant universe.

The props and costumes are spot on, and there are so many amazing details in every episode. This helped bring the ""Star Wars"" universe out on the screen in such a great way.

I have seen every episode three or four times; the first time around for the storyline, then going back to watch it for the details. Plus, I must admit that the show is entertaining enough to support multiple viewings.

This is certain winner for the ""Star Wars"" universe, and it was a much needed addition to the franchise. I am rating it a solid ten out of ten stars."
"I actually liked the first two seasons concluding with a great ending. They were entertaining and a well made additio to the STAR WARS universe.

Although some of the episodes of season three are well played and directed it seems that the overall story is forced to conclude into the sequels, which is the worst possible scenario.

Season three feels incomplete and pointless at the same time. Too many (sub-)storylines are started but not concluding into any storyline you can follow. Some episodes felt totally out of touch with a complete story. You could cut down all episodes to three hours without missing anything imprtant.

So, in the end ANDOR remains the only Disney produced series worth watching."
"Somehow the producers and money men managed to get hold of The Mandalorian and ruin it for season 3. It looks cheap, devoid of earlier quality and tonally off from previous two seasons. It seems the same imbeciles who brought us Boba Fett and Obi-Wan managed to insert themselves into the brilliant Mandalorian for the most recent season, therefore quality has dipped remarkably whilst kid friendly casting and cheap scenic/costume work has been snuck in, at points it felt like I was watching Xena Warrior Princess... What a waste, well almost, as there's flashes of the old seasons at points, but all that does is to remind you of what you're missing."
"After so many years of postponing I finally decided to watch all the Star Wars movies and so also this series. Since there are different ways to watch it I'm going for the chronological order and not the release date order, that just makes more sense to me. Maybe I watched a couple movies when I was young, I probably did, but I don't remember anything about it so to me it's all new and maybe one day I will understand the whole hype about the Star Wars saga. After watching The Phantom Menace, Attack Of The Clones, Revenge Of The Sith, Solo: A Star Wars Story, Rogue One, A New Hope, The Empire Strikes Back and Return Of The Jedi it's now time for The Mandalorian. It's supposed to be happening between Return Of The Jedi and The Force Awakens so it's only logical I watch it now. I do hope there will be much more seasons though as I just loved this show. Pedro Pascal is perfect as The Mandalorian. Each episode is quite short but very enjoyable to watch, certainly if you just watched all the other movies just before. It's a nice continuation of this saga. You can write whatever you want about the early movies in this saga, but the modern ones just beat them in everything, quality, acting, and technology, as so does this series. I binge watched the first season in 24 hours that's how good I thought it was. Next will be The Force Awakens but to be honest I can't wait to watch other seasons from The Mandalorian as it's for me the best thing in the whole Star Wars saga thus far."
"I never used to watch this show. My wife loved this show and whenever she would watch it I would never pay attention because I had no interest in it. But then one day I happen to look up and see something funny and I got hooked. Out of all the characters on this show the one I can relate to the most was Chandler.

I started watching all the reruns with my wife all the time on TBS. But after my wife passed away in September of last year I just can't bring myself to watch the show. All I have to say is the show is definitely worth watching and it was sad to see it go.

Thank you Matthew for making me and my wife laugh. Rest in peace."
"I must've have rewatched these 10 series dozens of times since it first aired.

After hearing the devastating news this morning that Matthew Perry had passed away, I'm watching it with a new pair of slightly sadder eyes.

'Friends' got me through a sad and difficult childhood. Sitting down to watch the new episodes at 9pm every Friday on channel 4, was one of the only things I can remember my family did together with no arguments.

First watched as a 12 year old, not getting most of the jokes, but laughing (mostly at Chandler!) all the way through each episode ....and now watching as a 40 year old, understanding far too well all the troubles of love and work, and life and friendship.

What a brilliant show."
"What can be said about Friends that hasn't already been said? It's easily one of the best sitcoms of all-time. It's on every ""best sitcoms ever"" list for a reason...because it is! If that doesn't convince you just read through these reviews and you'll see just how loved this show really is. The cast is perfect, not a weak link on the entire show. Almost everyone can find someone on the show that they identify with. I've seen every episode numerous times (considering it's always on) and I still laugh just as much on every watch as I did the first time I watched it. I'll continue to watch reruns and laugh and I doubt that I'll ever get bored with this show."
"I still love Friends as much now as an adult than I did when it was originally on 25 years ago when I was still a kid. It's just one of those all-time great sitcoms that are just as funny watching reruns as it was watching for the first time. You can probably tell it's still a very popular show even 25 years later by it always being on. Seriously, so many channels run the reruns that you can almost find it on anytime throughout the day. Not many shows hold up and are just as funny today as they were 20+ years ago but Friends is absolutely one of those shows. All six main characters are almost equally as funny. This truly is one of the best comedies that has ever been made."
"Are you happy? watch Friends! are you sad? watch Friends! not sure! yet, watch Friends!"
"There never has been a sitcom that truly pictures life among the singles (twenty-something) as good as this show does. It's not just comedy, it presents the episodes in such a way that one can truly identify with the situations they face so the audience has something to talk about in coffee shops too. The humor is universal. I feel like I'm part of the group every time I watch it because I feel the different emotions they go through. Plus, of course, it is so much fun because it's fast-paced. Every scene and every moment is relative to what is going to happen next so you don't feel like it is dragging you onto nothing. Just like how a sitcom should be. Funny!"
"'Friends' is simply the best series ever aired. The acting is amazing; after watching a few episodes you stop referring to the actors by their real names altogether, even if they appear in another movie. The characters are addictive, none are completely positive or negative. It would be quite easy to get along with or to be very annoyed by any of them in real life. Yet, all of them together (or even divided in groups) create this amazing chemistry that most people desire and few lucky ones have. The humor is wonderful, no matter what type of humor you like, you will get to a point where you will find at least something absolutely hilarious. There is slapstick, some light humor, some dark humor, some raunchiness, some cheesiness - a little bit of everything. The story is captivating; viewers keep coming back to see what situation fate (being the writers) puts the characters in today. It is truly a television masterpiece.

There are, however, many people who scoff at the mentioning of 'Friends'. My guess is they've never seen or paid attention to the show. It's easy to discard something because ""everyone likes it"" and be ""unique"", when in reality the uniqueness is actually bias. Just watch a few episodes with before making any judgements - chances are you'll fall in love with it too. I would have serious doubts about one's sense of humor if I heard that they hated 'Friends'."
"Okay, so i watched friends 3 4 years ago and now it has become a daily part of my life. Im engineering student so i often come home exhausted from uni and watch friends with my sister all day to relax . I love the show the characters make me laugh and i forget my worries. A lot of people have complaints about the show saying it doesnt having enough POC characters and being unfunny? As POC i literally have no problem with the show's lack of POC characters honestly, i mean it doesnt bother me that much and i agree Seinfeld has better jokes than friends but it doesnt mean that friends isnt funny, its different and simple and flawed and that what makes the show so good to watch. A lot of people watch friends to learn english too so its fun. Not everything has to be ""woke"" and a masterpiece for people to enjoy and cherish and please do not forget the show came out in 90s and back then creators didnt focus that much about different agendas."
"The series aged like fine wine. I finished this whole series within a month like 236 episodes or more like 78 hours of content, that's how much interesting this series is. Some cliff hangers at the end of seasons is very suspenseful that i couldn't wait to watch the next season. Joey, Phoebe, Chandler, Monica, Ross & Rachel we like my friends by the end of the series. The comedic timing and all the funny elements of the show is on point. And the most important fact is that after finishing the series we could just start the series all over again and feel fresh. It has an immense amount of repeat value that we wouldn't get bored even after watching several times. I could go on for pages but the memes, the sitcom references, the stars the show created all speak form them selves."
"I cannot remember the amount of times I've sat down and thought ""I want to watch a new series on Netflix and start a new film!"" And after 5 minutes of watching something new I thought, why bother?!? And switch over to watching friends 😂 easy to watch, great comedy and full of content that's completely original. The more I watch it the more I learn about the characters I grew up with, and how I would respond to certain situations, with or without the overhead laughter in the background. I don't know a single person that hasn't seen this, so if your one of them reading my review, do yourself a favour and grab a glass of wine, or whatever, and prepare for back to back television greatness. Thank you ""Friends"""
I won't lie when I say I'm probably one of the people who think this show is not funny. This has been recommended to me multiple times before I actually did give it a try. The first episode was meh but I kept watching until I found myself actually loving this show and it's really good and super chill. I think you actually have to know the characters more for you to appreciate their humor. This show is one of my go-to's when I'm feeling so down. Friends is so overrated and is always in most people's recommendations that you just keep on scrolling past through the list but seriously it's a good show and worth giving a shot!
"I have never watched something so unfunny, fake and weird. I wanted to see what the hype was about and didn't stop watching it even when I thought that it can't get any worse. I saw all the seasons because everyone kept saying that it will get better. Well, it didn't. The characters are so fake (especially Joey). For the longest time I believed that I just didn't like sitcoms before I found some other shows that were actually interesting and in which the story was developing not only during the first two and the last two episodes of the season. Honestly, I don't get it. I sincerely do not understand why this show is so popular even today when we truly have some really good series and sitcoms."
"To these days I can't figure out what made this average sitcom to be so especial for people. The best conclusion I could reach is that this show served for escapism to the real issues that American people where suffering in those days.

Perhaps by seeing that those characters could overcome topics such as: divorce, infidelity, sexual inclinations, obsession etc, with a smile on their faces, real people in a way, could deal with that issues in that way. However, ""Friends"" was a fictional show, much of what it happened, albeit taken from reality, was dealt in a light-hearted way.

To sum up, although the premise was interesting (six friends living together in New York), the development of the plot and characters could have been a bit more realistic."
"Everyone says that Seinfield is the greatest show ever. I love Seinfield but it doesn't come close to Friends. Every episode of Friends will make you laugh non-stop. We have grown to love the characters and what happens to them. The fitting personalities of these characters are absolute genius. Rachel the spoiled yet sweet girl, Monica the mother figure, Phoebe the hippy chick, Joey the dopey yet cool Italian, Chandler the sarcastic loser and Ross the neurotic victim stay together to help each other with their problems in the big city. I've got every season on DVD. This sitcom, in my opinion, is the greatest sitcom of all time and it changed the TV world forever. It's a great show."
"Friends is without a doubt the best American TV show ever to air. It has sad and hilarious storylines and makes you feel the sadness and jot out of any situation. The actors do fantastic and you really feel like you know a part of them by the end of the show. This will be a show I will never forget as I make constant references to the episodes. I wish the show could come back on air because I miss them so much, but I'm glad it got all the fame it did because it deserved it."
Even in 2019 it is very funny. A really great show. Must watch
"If you want a show that is filled with romance/drama and comedy, this is the show that is fit for you, because it IS filled with romance,drama and comedy that is why wherever I go I will NEVER forget that show,those characters and those series. I am unlikely to give good reviews but F.R.I.E.N.D.S really captured my heart!

This show is the BEST show that I EVER watched because: 1.It makes me laugh. 2.Whenever I am lonely I watch the show so that I will be happy again. 3.The actors and actresses portray their characters very well. 4.The stories are unique. 5.The script IS Amazing!

So now that I gave you the reasons why I love it... I now recommend you to watch It!"
"I am such a fan of the Friends tv show. The characters are well developed independently and together they play off each other well. Some moments are cheesy while others are funny, while the rest is just very well acted and dialogued by the cast. At least give the first season episodes a go, if you still don't like it, don't watch it. But for those who enjoy a well developed multi character show..... Friends is sure to make you laugh and want to get to know each character more. Its a television show.... there are bound to be goofs or inconsistencies, no television show has ever ever in the history of tv been 200% perfect. I plan on buying the whole series on Blue-Ray soon to add to my dvds."
"It's really crazy but I still watch Friends 4 times a week. There is nothing that could cheer me up like this on a full day. The humor, the characters, the details (i see more and more every time - and I've watched every episode A LOT).

I was born in 1992 and the last 4-5 seasons I bought when they just came out. I have them all on DVD. I have the Friends Book. Just missing a 'Frankie says hi' t-shirt to join the collection ;-) I just dissapear in the serie when I watch it. Love it. BIG CRAZY FAN says bye! X"
"I love this show so much! F.R.I.E.N.D.S is a sitcom that you could easily binge-watch at any time of the day. I was able to finish the whole 10 seasons, which ran for 10 years, in under a month. That's just how great it is! I can't even give it a negative review about anything. You'll just really learn to love all the characters through time. No wonder people have clamored for a reunion with the cast, you just can't get enough of it.

When you're feeling down and think you could use a good laugh, put this one on top of your to-watch list. It doesn't matter that the show ran from 1994-2004, the humor it had is timeless!

In a perfect world where we could pick a series that could run forever, F.R.I.E.N.D.S would be that show. Notice how different TV networks are still doing re-runs at present time even after it has ended back in '04. You'll find that a new generation of viewers who are watching and loving it are surprised to discover that the cast are quite old already. Nothing could beat it."
"I am quoting some body but I totally agree with this - ""If I get a wish from a genie someday, I would ask him to erase my memory, so that I can watch Friends again afresh and relish those priceless moments....""

To say that F.R.I.E.N.D.S is a good situation comedy would be a gross understatement of monumental proportions. When you watch friends, you just don't watch it, you live it.

It is not about how perfect you have to make your life.. it is about how every moment , good or bad , together makes life perfect.

No matter what kind of person you are, you can always relate to its story line. Unlike most of the contemporary serials, this one does not have a narrow perspective. There are no fart jokes, no clichés, no stereotypical bullshit - just original day-to-day incidents and the fun and laughter and quarrels associated with it. There are no jokes for joking sake. And it would blow your mind to think how anyone can create six characters like Chandler Bing, Monica Geller, Joey Tribbiani, Phoebe Buffay, Rachel Green and Ross Geller.

Hands down - ""best thing ever and not just on TV"""
"To this day, the worldwide success of Friends is still a bit of a mystery to me.

Sure, the show has its moments, but nothing that groundbreaking or laughing-out-loud funny that would have justified all the accolades.

Friends was a very ambivalent show: it had the pretense of being believable, while still relying, and heavily so, on the same old Sticom 101 material.

The characters were supposed to be oh so modern and new, but in the end they all fell into a stereotype, as the show was devolving into a comedy-soap. Whatever development the characters had, it was either short-lived, flimsy or a ""Flanderization"" (ie. comical and unrealistic exaggeration of a specific trait that wasn't so dominant earlier on).

The core of the show, the infamous Ross+Rachel love story stopped being interesting after the equally infamous ""we were on a break!"" debacle. Both changed their mind and heart at the drop of a hat, which seriously harmed the empathy. Long, drawn-out relationships work only if at least one half of the couple is genuinely suffering about the breakup or about being turned down. Both Ross and Rachel instead acted like 8th graders all along, being over each other and not over each other with no rhyme or reason.

It almost felt like them getting back together was the writers' Haily Mary pass... ""We're out of ideas... Let's get Ross and Rachel share a kiss, or have a baby!""

The ""happy ending"" feels more like a token send-off to tie some loose ends, but it's really just another knee-jerk reaction of two adults who clearly can't put their act together.

The same lack of development hits Joey as well. Despite him being the least objectionable human being of the lot, if you're willing to gloss over his tactless approach to dating, he goes from being a suave ladies' man to a childlike moron who's more or less his married friends baby. His aborted love story with Rachel could have been a much better finale, given he was indeed showing a softer side. But, alas, it had to be Ross+Rachel.

Monica and Chandler shared a tragicomically traumatic childhood that left them scarred, so them finding each other made sense and, with all the exaggerated personality quirks (Monica is a control freak, Chandler is socially inept) they're the most believable characters in the end.

Phoebe can be fun on small doses, but she's clearly having mental issues, so shoehorning her into married life, albeit while still retaining her out-there personality, felt forced.

That's the most annoying side of the show: for all the hype and all the great reviews, Friends was just another sit-com, with plenty of forced drama. The innovative love story between a cute girl and a dork is still sold as a top feature, but I maintain it wasn't that great.

Oh well, at least the show has aged horribly, so the chances of it still being perceived as one of the best of all time are getting smaller. Nostalgia will still keep it going strong, but to those who loved it so much back then I ask... watch it again and see if it was worth all the praise."
"It is quite simple. Friends is a comedy of very basic humour aimed at teenagers and young adults, with unsophisticated sense of humour.

It is also painfully obvious that towards the end, they were desperately trying to make it last 10 seasons, most likely so they could say they beat Seinfeld's 9 season run. The trouble with this is, Seinfeld had 9 amazing seasons with great writing, Friends had (and I'm being very generous here) at most 5 or 6 OK seasons and then 4 abysmal seasons.

It became a soap opera with recycled humour and recycled character traits that weren't that good so start with, then got worse at the 100th time you saw them. I find it so hard to understand why people rate this so highly. It is truly awful."
"People are saying that friends is running out of ideas and that the humour is getting dull. Running out of ideas? possibly. Humour getting feeble? absolutely not. In fact it's getting better. OK, so perhaps they're beginning to ""pair up"" the six of them, but so what. Chandler's sarcasm is still as funny as ever. Monica's quirkiness still works. Phoebe's goofiness still brings about a smile. And Joey,Rachel and Ross are still as funny as they always were. So stop being a bunch of cynics and enjoy the show while it's still on."
"What can be said about The Sopranos that hasn't been said? It's absolutely one of the best tv shows of all-time. I just rewatched it all the way through again 15 years after it ended and it still holds up today as one of the best shows ever. The writing and acting is what makes this show so special. The entire cast is perfect for their roles, especially James Gandolfini as Tony Soprano. If it winning a million awards isn't enough for you to watch it then all you have to do is ask anyone who's ever seen it and I guarantee they'll say go watch it immediately. So, if you're one of the few people who hasn't seen this amazing show yet then do yourself a favor and go watch it as soon as you can. I promise you won't be disappointed."
"The Sopranos is universally thought of as one of the best tv shows of all-time and is at the top of every ""best ever"" list ever created for a reason...because it is! It follows New Jersey mob boss Tony Soprano (James Gandolfini) as juggles the problems he has to deal with both running his mob family and his own family. He starts having panic attacks which makes him talk to a therapist about his problems. This show is The Godfather of television. Every seasons had such high expectations, as much as any show I can remember, but it not only continued to meet those expectations but exceeded them season after season. There's nothing I can say about this incredible tv show that hasn't already been said. All you have to do is read through the reviews to see how loved this show really is. It's absolutely perfect!"
"The Sopranos is arguably the greatest show in Dramatic Television history.

Its hard to think of another series that boasts so much intelligence, sublime writing or first rate performances.

Across its epic scope it produces fresh and iconic characters and a constant level of high quality. Centering around the life of one Tony Soprano, a man who lives in two families. One is the conventional wife and two kids nuclear family the other a huge New Jersey Mafia group, of which he is the boss of both. Played by James Gandolfini, of True Romance and The Mexican fame, Tony is a fascinating, scary but also likable guy. Full praise must be given to Gandolfini for making a womanising and horrifically aggressive brute a genuinely identifiable and perfect leading man. Contemporay American drama has never had such an arresting and iconic figure as Tony.

The cast of hundreds never boasts a flat performance and such stand out characters like Paulie Walnuts and Ralph Cifaretto will stick in your memory for ever.

The true genius of this tale however, is the creator and writers bravery and revolutionary take on a conventional drama series. Twenty minute long dream sequences, powerful and original use of symbolism and metaphorical imagery and truly shocking scenes of violence. Yet all this style is met by truly touching themes of love, honour and respect for family. The series never becomes cold hearted or gratuitous.

With TV now competitive and often poor The Sopranos stands tall above the rest as America's most original and compelling drama. Forget Family Redifined. This is Television Redifined."
"What can you possibly say about a show of this magnitude? ""The Sopranos"" has literally redefined television as we know it. It has broken all rules, and set new standards for television excellence. Everything is flawless, the writing, directing, and for me, most of all, the acting. Watching this show you'll find yourself realizing that these characters are NOT real. The acting tricks you into thinking there is a real Tony Soprano, or any character. This show is also very versatile. Some people don't watch the show because it's violent, it's not all about the violence, it's about business, family, and many deeper things that all depend on what you, as a fan see. For me, I don't like when people refer to the show, a show about the Mafia. For me, it's a show about family. A family who, through generations, happen to be apart of the mob. Overall this is a masterpiece of a show. This is what television should be. Right here. Complex characters from stunning acting, magnificent story lines from brilliant writing, and what do you get when you mix these ingredients together? A show that defines excellence, and dares to be different."
"I can't believe that it took me this long to get around to seeing ""The Sopranos"". I had heard a lot about it, but I can affirm that with this show, ""Six Feet Under"" and ""Game of Thrones"", HBO revolutionized TV in the 21st century. A gritty look at a mob boss and how he tries to balance his work life and family, this show pulls no punches. One of the points that it makes is that there aren't really any ""good"" or ""bad"" characters. People do what they think best serves the family.

I don't know if I would go so far as to call it the greatest show ever - my personal fave of HBO's series is ""Six Feet Under"" - but the writing, acting and direction combine to make something that you won't get on the networks or basic cable. If you want to understand some of the best that TV can provide, then you owe it to yourself to watch ""The Sopranos"". Great show.

Too bad that James Gandolfini, Nancy Marchand and the recently deceased Frank Vincent are no longer with us."
"I ve just finished watching ""The Sopranos"" for the 4th time. I think its flawless. I wouldnt change anything about it. Cant wait to watch it for the 5th time."
"Simply the best writing, and the best acting... I've seen it five times and it never gets old... I'm an absolut tv and movie geek, thousands of hours invested in this ""lifestyle"" and still nothing beats The Sopranos... And nothing will ever beat it... James Gandolfini steals every second of his screen and non-screen time, makes you wish these guys would still be in the 20th seasson if James would be alive! Can't wait for The Saints of Newark... Johnny Boy Soprano played by Jon Bernthal OMFG!!"
"This is The Godfather of TV series. I've rewatched all 86 episodes a few times and it's quite amazing how they'd kept up the quality over so many episodes. Aside from the great acting and writing, the directing is incredible - there are many scenes where nothing special happens, yet the atmosphere makes these scenes unforgettable. Character development at its best: I felt like I was there, experiencing their world throughout the series. A masterpiece."
"The Sopranos is one of the best TV-shows I have ever seen. If you like gangster/mobster/mafia movies, I can strongly recommend ""The Sopranos"". The show is mainly about Anthony ""Tony"" Soprano and his life as a father, husband and leader of a mob in the 21st century. The show is (as far as I know) realistic, compared to many other mafia shows and movies I have seen. The actors fit like a glove to their parts. This show made me realize how good many of these actors are in other shows and movies. This show has it all; humor, action, drama, good music, good actors, good ""behind the camera"" people and a good plot. The show displays all sides of the mob business; ""buisness"", private life, the cops/FBI point of view, the victims side of the story and much more."
"THE SOPRANOS (1999-2007)

Number 1 - Television Show of all Time

Everyone thought this would be a stupid thing that wouldn't go past a pilot episode. The Sopranos has become a cultural phenomenon and universally agreed as one of the greatest television shows of all time.

James Gandolfini plays the enigmatic New Jersey crime boss, Tony Soprano, accompanied by a stellar cast. Edie Falco is superb as the worrying, loving upper-middle class mother; Tony Sirico is tremendous as a superstitious, greying consiglieri who is often very funny.

While the show has often been criticised for the negative stereotype of Italian-Americans as mafiosi, and to an extent this is undeniable, I can see so many positives from the show. The portrayal of strong family values, friendships, love and compassion; could this be present in a coarse television show about gangsters? Yes. Furthermore, other burning issues are discussed such as terrorism, social inequality and injustice, homosexuality, drugs etc. This is no shallow, dull show about tough guys and violence. It has so much more. Many of the issues we see on the show are very real.

The writing which has been pretty much great has infused so successfully current issues and managed to imbred them within the characters' lives, which makes the whole thing more interesting.

Credit must go to David Chase who has created an excellent television treasure and to James Gandolfini, for envisioning, television's most complex and enigmatic character.

Simply exceptional.

10/10"
"Name any other show you like, I've watched it. And the other great ones, all of them. Numerous times. Loved them, even. But this is the best thing ever made, bar none. This is not Goodfellas Godfather shlock. This is the finest character study ever filmed. And James Gandolfini is the most mesmerizing protagonist in television history. Come at me."
"The only show on T.V. worth watching in a sea of bad. Great acting, excellent music, intriguing storylines, and even hilarious situations are combined with HBO's no-holds-barred content. James Gandolfini is mesmerizing as Tony Soprano, a lynchpin in the Italian Mafia. However, instead of seeing Tony as just a one-dimensional thug, we see that he has a life outside of his criminal activities, and that's what makes this show different from it's competition. It's a different side to the story of criminals, that they have normal lives when not breaking the law. The entire supporting cast is brilliant, especially Edie Falco, as Tony's wife Carmela, a deeply religious woman who stands behind her man despite all of his sins and Lorraine Bracco, as Dr. Jennifer Merlhi, Tony's psychiatrist; a woman who fears him when she is giving him therapy, but secretly is attracted to him when they're apart. This is indeed ""the show that revolutionized T.V."" See it!!!"
"This came up as 'recommended' for me a few weeks ago and I'm so glad it did!! Obviously I don't live under a rock and have heard of The Sopranos before but being a young Aussie I didn't see how I would click with a show like this at all. Somehow it got me, I haven't finished yet but am about half way through and the more I watch the better it keeps getting. The storyline, acting, dialogue and chemistry between all the characters never misses and I am never bored. I could watch this show for days straight without loosing interest. I think it'll live on forever as one of the best shows ever made!! Tell me why in 2023 I am so intrigued my mob life in the Italian-American community ? Who knows but who cares! Long love the Sopranos."
"Take note streaming producers, this is how you make a television show. Storytelling of this nature is meant to be confrontational and not play into making a statement.

Watching this again on a streaming service, certainly makes me appreciate how great this is. Which to be honest I didn't truly appreciate it the first time around.

If you don't like the gangster/wise guys narrative, move along."
"Actually watched 'The Sopranos' for the first time just before the final season was about to end, when at the age where watching 15 plus certificate films and shows was allowed. It left a big impression on me even then, back when my knowledge of film and such was actually pretty limited (am still learning). Especially for the very much missed James Gandolfini, the unyielding storytelling (if by late teens standard a little too much at times) and the complexity of the writing.

'The Sopranos' is often on lists of the greatest shows ever made and one of the few to be near-universally acclaimed everywhere, and it is a distinction that is richly deserved. It really is that masterful and it not only is every bit as wonderful as remembered but also even better, due to understanding more of the material and themes and appreciating uncompromising approaches to tough subjects a lot more. Watching 'The Sopranos' feels so much more than watching a television show, it's like watching an epic grand opera and there is really not much to add to what has already been said.

Gandolfini plays an enormous part in what makes 'The Sopranos' so brilliant. He is absolutely masterful as one of the most iconic and most complex TV characters to have ever existed, full of chilling intensity but also equally powerful nuance. All the cast are fabulous in their fascinatingly written, compellingly real roles as well, coming over as real people with strengths and flaws and not caricatures. The chemistry scintillates throughout between the whole cast, every emotion in all the universal and relatable issues covered embodied.

Writing is also of exceptionally high quality, very hard boiled with a lot of gritty edge but with enough subtlety to avoid heavy handedness. It never felt soap operatic or heavy in melodrama, and the crackling energy of it and the amount of thought probing and emotional complexity there is is non stop. The storytelling is consistently transfixing in one of the few shows to exist to not have a bad season or an episode that disgraces the show, faltering only a little with the abrupt feeling latter stages of the final episode which was not enough to ruin what was absolute perfection up to then. The atmosphere never holds back and hits hard while not being in your face or gratuitous, nothing feels glamourised or sugar-coated.

Production values are tremendously stylish and cinematic worthy, while the music fits beautifully throughout. Direction is pacey and tight, while sympathetic enough in more intimate parts.

Summing up, one of the greatest shows ever made and a work of art. One of the easiest 10/10s given so far this year."
"When everyone is telling you how great a show is, it is possible to expect too much. Not in this case. While both subtle and sublime, it also is very violent at times. And while it was playing at HBO and therefor was allowed to do anything it liked to do (nudity and violence/blood), it never did anything just because it could do it. If you had bare breasts, it was at a strip club. If there was violence it occasionally lingered upon it, but sometimes cut away from it too.

But let's get to where the show is great: It's acting cast. I had seen quite a few movies with James Gandolfini, but it's a real eye opener seeing him as Tony Soprano. He uses a special ""voice"", that he made up for the character. And it suits him and the story. The show as it is, is trying not to judge too much. It leaves quite a lot of things open for interpretation. It does ground the Gangsters into reality, but it also lets you know that, there is more to some of them than meets the eye.

Of course the charismatic portrayal by Gandolfini might lead to impressions that were not entirely intended (just as Pacinos Scarface wasn't meant to be an idol either). But you can't fault the actor or the filmmakers for conclusions other people reach about their creation.

Having said that, the first season did seem a bit dated decorations wise, when looked upon in 2011 or '12 for that matter. But it does not take anything away from the show. And while I will still state that ""West Wing"" is my favorite TV show (the first 4 seasons were superior, the latter 3 not as good), the Sopranos is consistently good throughout it's 6(.5) seasons!

Another great thing about the show is, that it builds upon the story it set out. So there are strands of the story that will be explored later. But as in real life, some things might go unnoticed forever. You never know with the Sopranos what i's going to be. And it's a very good thing.

I drew my own conclusions concerning the ending, but I'm sure there other interpretations out there .. and the ending couldn't have been anything else. It just couldn't!"
This is the greatest show of all time. Nothing compares. James Gandolfini is absolutely outstanding. I could write a novel on how good The Sopranos is. Absolutely fantastic.
"The Sopranos is a terrific show. It may be violent, racist, sexist, and bad to the bone, it is also funny, melodramatic and cool. The characters are very well done and the acting is some of the best I've seen in years. It is also pretty keen for creator David Chase to pick Northern New Jersey as the set piece for his opus of crime life. I have liked this show alot since it aired on HBO in January of last year and I will keep on watching it because of the intrigue and drama."
"Best writing , Best characters , best drama , best crime , best of comedy . The best tv show ever"
"Watching the whole thing again front to back, series 4 on seems to start to wander a little. Series 5 can, at times, be simply dull. Series 6: what is that about? It's like all the back stories they realised they hadn't done needed to be told, and episodes with main stories that have no reason to be there. Series 6 is actually a different show. It's direction and pace are fundamentally off. It has the sense of trying to squeeze stuff in, but then not bothering with editing it down. It seems indulgent.

In my head I loved the sopranos. But it doesn't quite stand up to its memory."
"For decades I'd heard about how good this show was, one of the best of all time, etc. So I thought I'd better catch up, see what all the fuss was about, and check out season one. I love Scorsese's gangster movies, I'm a big fan of BREAKING BAD, which the same fans often rave about, so I was expecting great things. The first couple of episodes fluctuated, but the novelty saw me through, and the acting, particularly Gandolfini's, held my attention. Then I started wavering. The storylines seemed to slow down, and padding crept in. An episode about oral sex, another about random supporting characters trying out at music studios. The therapy scenes already became repetitive and tiresome. So I bailed. Perhaps this is one of those shows where you had to be there at the time, or perhaps it's one where you have to invest in a couple of seasons before it gets good. Either way, I'm done. Life's too short, and there are more interesting things to watch..."
"An older Kevin Arnold (Daniel Stern) recounts his childhood in suburbia. The Vietnam war is raging. The young Kevin (Fred Savage) has his annoying brother Wayne (Jason Hervey), rebellious sister Karen (Olivia d'Abo), housewife mother Norma (Alley Mills) and father Jack (Dan Lauria). His best friend is nerdy Paul Pfeiffer (Josh Saviano) and there is the suddenly blossoming girl-next-door Winnie Cooper (Danica McKellar).

It's an iconic award winning series that affected other shows. Fred Savage is utterly adorable as a child actor and it's a classic coming-of-age TV show. It's all great. The show lasted 6 seasons. It definitely has more trouble once it gets to high school. Kevin turns more angry, and less likable. Quite frankly, he's a selfish jerk. Winnie Cooper gets faded out in the middle seasons for some unknown reason. Paul gets the same treatment during the later years. This is a mistake. This is as much their show as it is Kevin's show. Their friendships is the heart of the show. I would love to have more Becky Slater for the fun although I didn't know about the sisters back in the day. That's not to say that the high school years are a bust. Even with its inherent darkness, there are some outstanding individual episodes. Frank and Denise remains one of my favorites in the entire show. That episode is poetic and I can still remember it all the way to the end. It's too bad that it couldn't make that transition because the first few seasons are the best of TV."
"My junior high & high school years were just a little bit before Kevin's era, but it was very easy to relate to every episode and almost all of the characters. I could always find someone be it fellow student, teacher or other adult in an episode that reminded me of someone from those school days. I really hated to see it end, but we couldn't keep Kevin in school forever. I really enjoyed the 2 part final episode, but it was sad when Kevin the narrator said that ""I never went back to that town"". What a bummer...with family still there and all of the great memories and experiences, how could you never go back? I also hate that the narrator Kevin seen with his son at the very end does not make it into syndicated episodes today."
"As someone who lived in suburbia and attended middle school and high school during the late 1960's and early 1970's, I identify with much that I see in ""The Wonder Years."" Like the show's narrator, I, too, remember counterculture students and status quo school administrators; devoted, optimistic homemakers and overworked, short-tempered fathers; adamant supporters of the space program and U.S. involvement in Vietnam, and advocates of social welfare and world peace; adherents to the sanctity of marriage and the traditional family, and those influenced by the women's liberation movement and the sexual revolution. I also remember middle and high school relationships and same-sex friendships, and some situations in ""The Wonder Years"" don't jibe with what with I knew.

Some people might tell me that in the name of entertainment I should accept a few of the less plausible scenes -- Kevin Arnold's getting tagged in the hall between classes with a round house right by the girl he opposed in a school election, for example -- and not look for a television show to accurately emulate life as I have experienced it. Because of the narrator's tone in some situations, however, I get the feeling that the makers of ""The Wonder Years"" expect the audience to take what they see and hear seriously, though I find myself thinking, ""This would not have happened,"" usually in response to whenever Kevin and Winnie, as middle-schoolers, share some exclusive time.

A physically mature 7th or 8th grader might kiss his girlfriend on the mouth, not the much more youthful, innocent pre-adolescent who could pass as a 5th-grader, such as Kevin Arnold of the show's first couple of seasons. I generally don't see anything wrong with Fred Savage's and Danika McKellar's acting, but in those romantic scenes when the two embrace they come across more as two children attempting to behave like adults rather than two precocious kids acting on their feelings for each other.

I don't have the same reaction to Winnie's and Kevin's romance when, as 17-18 year-olds, they watch a movie at the local cinema, study together at the kitchen table, or argue through some misunderstanding. In any case, the episodes including Paul, and especially those involving more significantly a member of Kevin Arnold's family -- his mother's pursuit of work outside the home and the brother's decision to forsake college and marry instead both moved me -- tend to suspend my disbelief."
"When I think about the programs that my family enjoyed when my brother and I were younger, this one always comes off as the most memorable, mainly because my family spent quality time together watching this show. Now, at 20 years old, this show is still as memorable and holds up against the test of time.

""The Wonder Years"" is a period dramedy told from the point-of-view of adult Kevin Arnold (narration of Daniel Stern), and recalls Kevin's adolescence during the turbulent times of the late 1960s and 1970s. Kevin (played brilliantly by Fred Savage) comes of age in suburbia in a neighborhood that many of our parents (including my mom) grew up in. Kevin lives in a ranch house with his parents, Jack (Dan Lauria), an accountant, Norma (Alley Mills) a housewife, and his older siblings, hippie Karen (Olivia D'Abo) and smart-alecky Wayne (Jason Hervey). He has a childhood sweetheart in Gwendolyne ""Winnie"" Cooper (Danica McKellar), and a best friend in lovable geek Paul Pfeiffer (Josh Saviano). Kevin deals with normal situations that is territorial with adolesence--first loves, heartbreak, middle school, high school, puberty, and growing up. Kevin grows up in uncertain times, much like children are today. Each episode is a chapter in Kevin's life, and follows him between the ages of 13 and 18--the most crucial years of growing up.

When this show was made, they definitely looked at the lives of teenagers. The characters were realistic, and no matter when you grew up, you could relate. Everyone could relate to Kevin, and many felt his adolescent pain. You knew your parents were overburdening, but realized later that they were only trying to help you. Everyone had a sibling like Wayne, and possibly like Karen.

I'm a product of the 1980s, and being born in 1982 put me out of the loop in regard to what the 1960s and 1970s were really like. My parents came of age in this decade, so they easily related to Kevin. The situations were comical, and this show was always good, clean fun. The humor wasn't overburdening, but it was evident, and we always laughed, but it also impacted you and made you think after it was all over. This show premired when my brother and I were only 5, and we watched it with our parents every week until it went off the air. I don't think this show ever was capable of cancellation, but it went out the way it was intended, and it left an indellible impression on this generation. When the reruns returned to television on Nick-at-Nite in 1998, my classmates and I, already in ninth grade, began to watch again. Now, I'm a sophomore in college, and if I can catch the reruns on ABC Family during the week, I'm thrilled. I truly miss this show, and watching reruns brings back great memories.

I don't have a favorite episode or memory--I have many favorite episodes and memories. Two of the moments that I can still remember vividly are when Winnie's older brother died in Vietnam and Kevin and Winnie shared their first kiss, and when Kevin's math teacher died. My mom, brother, and I always used to laugh (and still do) at my dad, who resembles Jack Arnold. We could be talking about something funny during dinner, and my father will sit there, stone-faced, much like Jack always did. I used to love when they'd ask him a question, and he would utter a low growl. While my dad has NEVER done that, he has always resembled Jack. Only now, several years later, he finds it funny that we thought that of him.

This was a wonderful show that never wore out its welcome, and continues to entertain those who catch the reruns. If you have the chance in your hectic day, as I sometimes do, catch a rerun or set your VCR to tape an episode for you. Relive a classic television program that continues to entertain and inspire years later. You certainly won't regret it."
"I have never had so much fun watching TV before or after ""The wonder years"". Kevin Arnold and Winnie Cooper were my friends and I could not possible imagine life without them. So many years after the show ended when I saw Kevin Arnold's pic in one of my friends computer screen NOSTALGIA did HURT. I mean it brought back memories of the yesteryears. It was very easy to relate to everything that Kevin was going through although I was from another world in India. His love interest the cute Winnie Cooper made it all the more interesting. Loved his best friend, though he did look like a nerd. I specially remembered a scene when Kevin kissed Winnie in the beach. Saying this might sound like saying a lot but it is just the truth. Sometimes the show seemed to me more important the books that I studied in school. A tutorial. It will always be close to my heart and fondly remembered. I can assume its like this for many of us around the world. Miss you Kevin."
"This is without a doubt one of the best serious programs that mixed humor and the style of sitcoms in history of American t.v.

Who didn't have a geeky friend that would always embarrass you like Paul? Who didn't have a crush like Beck? Or what about the unexpected crush from another super sexy girl? On the more serious aspects, who didn't have a discussion that could harm a family member? What about dealing with death, love, projects of school?

This show displayed the truth of life but only in a funnier way. I grew up watching Kevin and company dealing with the problems of diary life.

I personally find this to be the most complete drama-comedy show of the past 20 years. You won't find another visual experience like this.

It's like, remembering your childhood-puberty years through the eyes and memory of Kevin.

This show made me laugh, cry, reflex, and best of all, it brought me sensations of my life; you know, memories, smells, specific situations, etc. It's like a reproduction of my life through someone else's narration.

Also, the opening song is stuff for legend."
"Wonder years is a rarity among the modern day sitcoms. To be honest, i have never seen anything like this my whole life. It tells the story of young Kevin Arnold(Fred Savage) between the time he starts junior high and finishes high school. The whole series is presented to the viewer as a narration. Kevin lives in a quiet suburb with his family. His childhood sweetheart Winnie Cooper (Danica McKellar) and Paul Pfieffer(Josh Saviano) live next door, with whom he spends most of his time. This show made me laugh, it made me cry, it made me think about friendship and family bonding. It reminded me of my childhood and about the things which i did and did not. Altogether, a wonderful experience for the young and the old alike. I am sorry that this great show has not made a debut on DVD because of licensing issues. I hope some day the producers would release the DVD so that this dramatic gem is not lost in the tides of time. If you get an opportunity to watch a taped version, don't miss it..."
"I was born in 1980, so by 1988 I was still a little young (8yrs old) and not interested in TV other than cartoons. When I started watching this amazing show in the mid 90s (when the series was officially over but had reruns going nonstop) I was so taken by it. Not because it made me reflect on my childhood (because I was right smack in the middle of it) but because I had a big crush on Winnie and it was funny. It also gave me a little insight to suburb life which intrigued me because I was born & raised in Harlem, NYC.

Fast forward 20yrs to present day. I'm now 31yrs old (OK OK, so I'm not an old man yet) and I find that Netflix has FINALLY released this fabulous series on Instant streaming. Understand that I had been looking for this series on DVD or other wise for some time (I don't have cable so I can't catch the reruns on TV), so I was overjoyed when I added it to my queue and started watching it a couple of days ago. It was every bit as great as I remembered it, PLUS MORE!!! NOW I was able to enjoy it because of how it cause me to reflect on my childhood. After moving from NYC to the suburbs in my early youth, I could relate to a lot of what Kevin Arnold went through and how the narrator (old Kevin Arnold) saw things through his own eyes. Let me tell you, this show made me cry when I was young because I was such a fan of the Winnie & Kevin relationship.... now this show made me cry again!! I'm only on season 3 right now, but every single episode has plucked on my heart strings and played a tune of love, laughter, loss, rebellion, reflection, failure and victory. I wasn't born and raised in the 60s, but this show makes me wish I was.

I HIGHLY recommend this series to those raised in the pre-digital age, those who witnessed the birth of the digital age, and all those poor unlucky saps who were raised in the 80s and have not had the chance to watch it yet!!! Bonus: If you're a big movie & TV buff like me, you're gonna see a LOT of familiar faces when they were young! I've already seen a young Screech & Zack Morris from Saved By The Bell, a young Larenz Tate, and a couple of actors from some Christian videos I used to see when I was young (anyone remember Mcgee & Me??)."
"ABC has always been the purveyor of family comedies, ""The Wonder Years"" was no exception to the rule!! The difference, however, was the fact that this show was an intuitive doggerel of nostalgia which articulated an acute aspect of the YUPPIE's adolescence!!! Kevin Arnold (Ted Savage) was the perpetually befuddled kid whose predicaments were the focal point of this series, and it was his perspective that this entire show was centered around!! Daniel Stern, known for staring in the terrific movie ""Diner"", was the little voice inside Kevin that became the adult interpretation to Kevin's childhood chicanery!! The whole genre of the late sixties and early seventies was so astutely depicted on this show, right up to the fact that his mother looked just like Doris Day!! The trials and tribulations of the Arnold family were indeed a harbinger of the encroaching radicalism of American culture... Perhaps, the most impressionable character who effectuated these changing times most plausibly, was the role of Kevin's sister!! Winnie, Kevin's sort of girlfriend, was perhaps the most sensitive relationship in the series.... Looking back at it though, the whole family relationship with the older brother, the mother, the father and the sister as well as the interaction with their friends, were all delicate in their own way... The show illustrated how a comprehensive understanding of every one of the members in your family required a loving dedication to what being a family was all about!! The conception that things are suppose to be one way, and yet, they wound up being quite another, was a painstaking experience for the entire Arnold family!! This was an opportunity for adversity to manifest itself as some constructive element of household unification!! Perenially, this domestic fortitude was portrayed on ""The Wonder Years"" as an ideological staple!! Perhaps the most compelling aspect of ""The Wonder Years"" was that it pinpointed the formidable scenario of the true love cliché,(for families) and made it stick!! This was not a hokey case of true love conquering all, rather, an insight to how emotional support evoked an understanding of the bittersweet ordeals in any given domicile which are dealt with properly when everyone cares for one another!! ""The Wonder Years"" was a fabulous T.V. Show, and ,it came off as being emotionally nurturing and empathetic to the needs of the overly mortgaged YUPPIE, because, it was something for them to reminisce about!! This show was one of my favorite television shows ever!! I do not see it in syndication that much, too bad!! It must be the cable package I have, or my schedule, I would love to see reruns of ""The Wonder Years"" I think that that would be a lot of fun!!"
"Like many shows the first few seasons were better than the last two or three. There's only so much teenage angst I can take and some of it was pretty contrived. The writing on this show was too uneven, though I highly recommend the episodes on the piano lesson, the choir practice, and the math teacher, possibly some of the best writing in TV history. By the last season I wanted to throw tomatoes at the narrator. If I had to hear any more end-of-episode tripe like ""just as in the spring the flowers bloom, boys everywhere are on the cusp of manhood"" I was going to barf. From the other glowing reviews, looks like I may be in the minority here."
"I never watched That '70s Show, but in some ways The Wonder Years was the precursor. There were tender, funny, sad, tragic moments in The Wonder Years, and the finale was one for the heart string.

Could The Wonder Years be rebooted in the social media age maybe."
"The Wonder Years truly was a great television sitcom in its time,and for those of us who still enjoy the re runs,it is still much loved today.Kevin Arnold was the typical all American teenage boy we all felt close to,even if he was just a character that doe eyed actor Fred Savage brought to life.We followed his daily trials and tribulations,using his experiences to reflect on our own.The sitcom's true to life story lines,comedy,drama and nostalgic tone contributed to the show's success and made watching it enjoyable.The Wonder Years could make you laugh,make you cry,make you remember what it was like to be 12 years old,and in love,as we fondly watched the relationship between Kevin and his dream girl Winnie Cooper,blossom,overcoming all the obstacles along the way.The closing dialogue of this magical sitcom will forever be remembered: Growing up happens in a heartbeat.One day you're in diapers,the next you're gone.But the memories of childhood stay with you for the long haul.I have fond memories of the Wonder Years,and enjoy watching the re runs.Hopefully the complications will be overcome in the near future,and the magic of this memorable sitcom can be re lived on DVD."
"Most of the plots of the show actually happened to the target audience of the time -30 somethings. That's what made this show great. For me it was school walk out to protest the Viet Nam war. I remember thinking when I first watched that episode, did the writers go to Oak Crest Jr. High in Encinitas with me in 1969? Because that's exactly the way it happened. I think of that episode daily when I drop my son off at the same school. I see that courtyard where we all walked out to, and remember the strife of the teachers talking, should we, or shouldn't we allow this to happen, and just like the show, the one or two teachers that joined in, were the ones we thought were cool."
"This is perhaps one of the best TV shows ever written. The writing is really strong with a mixture of subtle comedy, drama and romance. I think what makes this show so good is the very believable story lines. People can relate to almost every episode having experienced similar things in real life. But perhaps the defining factor is the casting. It's perfect. Every recurring character is ideally cast. Even the guest actors such as Mr. Collins, the match teacher, Cutlip, the gym teacher, etc. are fantastic in their roles. The comedy is not over the top and the drama is not melodramatic. The icing on the cake is the music. Fantastic selections of 60's/70's tunes help to make the show."
"I watched The Wonder Years every Tuesday night when I was in Jr. High and I don't think I ever missed an episode. That was 20 years ago and I still watch it today with my 9 year old son. The setting is so ""Everytown USA"" in that it brings back memories of growing up in suburbia for probably everyone who watches. The Arnold family is like every other family, wonderful and loving and dysfunctional all at the same time. Norma and Jack remind me of my parents. The loving mom that you adore yet are a little embarrassed to be seen with and the stern, bread winning dad who isn't home very often and when he is he's reading the paper/watching t.v., or telling you to cut the grass. And of course the big brother who you fight with constantly but look up to at the same time. And the free-spirited older sis, whose aimless wandering we can all identify with. The clothes, the music, the bicycles with banana seats and the relationships and life lessons all ring true to those who have grown up and remember our own ""wonder years"". And for the young kids watching it today, as it did for me when I first watched, it teaches important lessons about growing up and how to enjoy it while it lasts! There is nothing else like it, it's simply the best!"
"(cue the movie trailer voice guy>) In a world where Breaking Bad and The Wire (both incredible shows) both score 9.4 and The Wonder Years only scores 8.2. (end the movie trailer voice guy)...Seriously though...this is a travesty. I honestly couldn't believe that The Wonder Years didn't score higher. Granted that this is a deeply personal show for me...but judging from the other reviews, it seems to be a deeply personal show for a lot of people. What is amazing about The Wonder Years is its ability to relate cross generations. I'm not going to talk specifically about any one episode because there are too many and no one here wants to read about my life story, but bear with me. I was born in 1980...so when I started watching The Wonder Years I was 8 and it ended when I was 13.....pretty much my formative years as a child. Watching the show during this time even as a child it was important to me. As a child, I could relate to Kevin or at least some of the other characters on a level where the understanding to me had everything to do with his experiences as a child and not a whole lot for the generation in which he lived his life. It worked for my parents because the show both created nostalgia to the time period in which they grew up as well and holding nostalgic memories of experiences that they may have had in common with the characters. Watching this show later in life only further showed me how great a show this truly was. Viewing this show 20+ years later you are able to see the show in a completely different light. While I'm not able to share in the nostalgia of the time period...as my parents...I am able to better relate to teenage Kevin....and his parents, grandparents, and dare I even say his jackass of a brother Wayne. If I wrote this review at another time I might be able to write a better one, but I am writing this on pure emotion and I can honestly tell you that this was one of the best shows ever made for television. The creators and the writers knew exactly what they were doing and it showed. Perhaps the Wonder Years was a little too far ahead of its time...or maybe America is all the stupider. I just feel bad for the kids of today that have no clue of this show. It is a damn shame that they won't either until licensing fees are worked out and and they can actually get this show on DVD. They need to do it right though. They can't leave out or replace the music because in blended in and complimented the show to a point that to leave it out would be to savagely diminish the quality....(sigh) Until then I'll have to rely on my bootleg copies and keep reminding the world that The Wonder Years even existed in the first place."
"The Wonder Years brings back nostalgia of an era which I did not live. Few people have lives as perfect and ordinary as Kevin Arnold: the nerdy best friend, the gorgeous girl-next-door, the hippie sister, the obnoxious brother. Though this is a television family, with all it's stereotypes in place, The Wonder Years perfectly encapsulates both the changing times of the late 60's/early 70's, and the painful awkwardness of adolescence.

This show will likely never be released on DVD. And if it is, it will be without the original music (liscensing for the huge amount of popular music would be astronomically expensive). This is unfortunate, because The Wonder Years is one of the best TV shows ever to be put on television. If you have a chance to, watch it!"
"I have to admit that I love Fred Savage as Kevin Arnold. The cast included Dan Lauria and Alley Mills playing his sixties' parents, the Arnolds. Then there were his siblings, a sister played by Olivia D'Abo and a big bully brother played by Jason Hervey. Kevin was the youngest and we hear his thoughts from Daniel Stern's narration. The other cast members included Danica McKellar as his love interest Winnie and a geeky friend whose name escapes me at the moment. The show is going to be aired late on the I network in a couple of weeks. I have to admit that I liked it in the beginning but it wore off in time. It was different because there was no laugh track or audience. Most family oriented comedies of the 1980s had audiences and laughter. This show was different and it was also set in the 1960s with an unknown suburb as location. The creators, Neal Marlens and Carol Black, who created Growing Pains went on to create The Wonder Years. The writing was uneven at times but solid as the acting."
"""The Wonder Years,"" even though the show was a period piece, it still seems like the events it portrayed weren't that long ago and still have some relevance today. I was born in 1985, so I wasn't alive when Kevin Arnold (Fred Savage) came of age during the turbulent 1960s and 1970s in the United States, as was portrayed in the show and whose thoughts were narrated by Daniel Stern. He was one of the most likable television characters of my formative years. The life lessons, the romance, the conflicts with friends and family alike, and the pains of adolescence and growing up still resonate nearly two decades later after this show's successful run on television with today's audiences. Why this show hasn't gotten a DVD treatment, I'll never know. I just know that for several years this was truly one of the best shows in the history of American television.

10/10"
"This series is one of the more memorable ones if you're a 90s kid. I felt like the series was really interesting and different compared to other tv shows of it's time.

American Dreams on NBC actually had similar run- and did quite well. But that would have been analogous to this one. American Dreams was fun to since it had a more musical element to it.

I felt like the timeline for Wonder Years, even as a kid, was never fully explained well.

He goes to junior high in 1968 and graduates high school a few years later? All of the characters were developed fully instead of the middle brother- I definitely would have loved to see more about his back story.

For me, the series just suffered alittle bit on ending alittle bit too soon. But I felt like later programs with a similar style and the My Girl Movie series did well."
"This show has an engaging cast with stories set in the 1960s that involved down-to-earth, realistic plots. That's the real wonder of THE WONDER YEARS. It is far superior to most sitcoms because it isn't really a sitcom -- in other words it isn't based on silly situations and lame-brained characters.

The show is about growing up and the discovery of human nature. The writing has a depth unlike that of most TV shows. The humor is genuine, not based on typical TV contrived situations and shallow clowning. This is destined to be one of the classics of TV series."
"Most Wonderful show i have ever watched.Its about a person recalling his growing up years and it is sure to bring back memories of your growing up days.It doesn't matter where you grew up,you can still relate to the show and everything happening to Kevin Arnold(lead). There are a lot of incidents that have happened in this show that sure have happened to everybody in their lives and there are a lot of episodes that will be stuck with you for very long time. But the only small glitch in this show which i did not like as much is Winnie cooper's character,Her character was somewhat bugging and irritating to an extent. There is lot of great humor as well spread throughout the series that makes the show more enjoyable. It is a classic and will be remembered for a long time. and in the finale it made me cry so much as i got attached to the characters a lot and couldn't believe i will never see them again.This is how a show and finale should be made too bad it didn't continue for more seasons for several reasons. I will miss you Arnold family,you were great almost became a part of my daily life for a while. I hope everyone reading watches this gem of a show at some point in their lives before they die."
"Seinfeld is absolutely, without a doubt, one of the best comedies in the history of television. It's just as hilarious today as when it was on in the 90's. There aren't many shows that hold up over decades and get just as many laughs today as back then but Seinfeld is definitely one of those shows. Larry David is just a flat out genius. Between this and Curb Your Enthusiasm, he's created 2 of the best sitcoms of all-time. This show is so good that you can find it running on some channel almost anytime of the day so it's obviously still doing well otherwise it wouldn't be on so much. I've seen each episode countless times and still laugh each time. I'll continue to watch this the rest of life and never get sick of it."
"What can I say about Seinfeld that hasn't already been said? It's just flat out hilarious and still holds up about almost 20 years later. I don't know of any sitcom ever (outside of maybe Friends) where all the co-stars are all equally funny! Jerry Seinfeld (Jerry), Jason Alexander (George), Michael Richards (Kramer) and Julia Louis-Dreyfus's (Elaine) are all some of the best sitcoms in the history of television. I mean everyone has there favorites but bottom line is they're all great as is the show! If you read any ""best sitcom ever"" list ever written you will find Seinfeld near the top on every list for a reason...because it is!"
"I hate saying something is the best ever. Still how could you go wrong with Seinfeld. Just hilarious characters and setups everywhere.

For everyone who has seen this show, what other show or even movie deliver so many open ended endings that still felt like a perfecting closing. That right there is great writing.

The characters are another great example of great writing. To think of people like Jerry, George, Elaine and Kramer. These characters were developed so greatly that the ideas for episodes were endless. Also the guest stars did a great job in their appearances just sliding right in.

The plots of the episodes were not that great from the outlook. If you actually watch the episodes though the most basic daily problem could be made into a very enjoyable episode.

This can only be done with great, superb writing. If you have seen this show watch it."
"I caught a few episodes of Seinfeld over it's final two seasons run on public channel, and made it a point to catch a lot more of Jerry and friends during it's reruns. I found it very amusing on first viewings, but as time wore on, I began to like it more and more, and to eagerly borrow taped episodes from friends, and to hunt for re-runs on syndicated channels.

Of the two comedy TV series in the history of television, I would choose both Seinfeld and Monty Python as the cultural landmarks of the medium. In Seinfeld, there is not a trace of sentimentality and glib moralizing that plagues the American sitcom genre. Characters do not hug each other on Christmas, fall in love, wax on and on about family and friends, there is no faux-cathartic season ender so favoured by the writers of, say, ""Friends"".

Instead, we have the narcissistic Jerry, constantly mining the minutiae of everyday detail for every bit of situational comedy; we have the hyper-aggressive Elaine, whose strings of breakups with boyfriends are as impressive as her petty neuroses leading up to the breakups themselves; the ultimate schlub-loser George, who lies to every single woman he dates, sells faulty equipment to the handicapped and muscles off women and children when fleeing an apartment fire; and the impossibly inventive physical comedy of the entrepreneur cum schmooze Kramer.

Over and over again, week in and week out, the quartet discuss trivialities with unbridled zeal, as the non-descript narrative pings from one mundane setting to another. Seldom has such wit been generated by such gargantually pointless human endeavours. That is where the brilliance of Seinfeld lies, in the ability to go to the most bizarre ends to fulfill the potential of a less than hopeful comedic premise; and the endless, pointlessly smug and nihilistic banter that almost invariably escalates into some of TV's classic lines, such as when George shouts triumphantly after winning an argument that ""there is no bigger loser than me!"".

Surely, we won't find something like this again, for many more years to come."
"I just can't stop binging this show. Like ever. Don't get me wrong FRIENDS is historic in its own place & I've binged that a lot too but Seinfeld just edges it for me.

Jason Alexander, you legend. George Costanza is the character that you see nowadays sitcoms are trying to pull off but they just can't. He's One of a kind. Just like Joey & Chandler. They are in a league of their own.

I review rarely and this is my first review & I'm sounding like i should be giving Seinfeld 10/10 but I've settled with 9. The reason for that is i base my rating simply on 3 factors: 1) Characters 2) Storyline 3) Screenplay i.e. length of how long a show is keeping me attached to the screen before i lose interest.

So for George, Kramer, Jerry i give it a perfect 10. But when it comes to Elaine, she's so lame. As a character, as a person i don't get her. Beauty of me binging Seinfeld is that I've chopped off her parts from all episodes. She's terrible, irritating and hardly makes me laugh. Writers haven't even attached background applause to her wise cracks. Downpoint of the show. 'Elame' Benes.

To shed a light on Jerry & Kramer, well they are the lifeblood of the show. Their chemistry makes you laugh. Kramer is very underrated. Also, Jerry & George's coffee shop chemistry. Those scenes are hilarious & refreshing. You'd never get bored watching their riddled lifestyles.

That's all, its a must watch. Even if sitcoms ain't your genre i think you must give this a try no matter what. It's just that good. And yes, first 2 seasons are a bit downer but important to watch for you to establish those characters. From season 3 you'd love the stories & start getting used to it. By season 5 & 6 you'd literally crack yourself up.

BEST SITCOM EVER MADE HANDS DOWN. Effortless entertainment. Once you watch it, mark my words you're gonna binge it. P.S: I've already crossed the 3-figures binge watching it and currently rewatching it for 183rd time. Love this show to bits. Never getting enough of this ever."
"A show that is about nothing. A formula never tried before and never since. This show works because of its unique sense of humour, characters and writing. Before Seinfeld entered TV sets everywhere nobody had seen anything similar to it. The show creates endless laughs and hilarity beyond belief. Whilst since it has been accepted as a great of the sitcom genre shows like Friends and The Big Bang Theory have attempted to repeat a similar low-brow, clever sense of humour however have been unable to repeat what this show could create.

Perhaps the reason why this show is the greatest sitcom ever is that it creates such a unique way of find laughs and somehow despite the fact that so many great shows after it have tried to repeat it, it is the only thing like it and is still able to be a never-ending run of laughter.

So, if you are considering watching Seinfeld go for it, give it a few episodes to become familiar with the characters and you won't regret it. You will never see another sitcom like it and you will see why many people consider it to be the greatest sitcom ever made, a true testament to the comedy of Jerry Seinfeld and Larry David."
"I dont know why People even bother bringing up friends.... it literally isn't even in the same league when comparing it to the brilliance of a man like George Constanza, he alone conquers the entire cast and sub cast of ""friends""

It's the best show that ever was and ever will be -Fact"
"I was sitting in my apartment tonight watching the end of a sitcom era with the last ""friends"" episode and it brought me back to 1998 when we all said goodbye to ""seinfeld"". I won't sit here and debate, which was the better show because, lets face facts they both did a fine job. They are two very successful sitcoms, but other than that they really had an entirely different feel and format.

""Seinfeld"" gave us all so many catch phrases and we all continue to enjoy these characters and episodes six years after the show ended. I just love it. I constantly find myself reciting lines from the show with a good friend of mine. This show rocks. It will always be a great show. I will continue to watch this show in reruns over and over. It sure doesn't get old.

I wanted to add some favorite lines or scenes from the show, but there are truly too many. Kramer, Elaine, George, and Jerry just rule and have such a great chemistry. The additional characters throughout the years were cool too. Some of my favorites were Puddy, Peterman, and Frank Castanza. Oh greatness.

So keep Seinfeld alive in your hearts and keeping watching the show about nothing.

Giddie Up!"
"I'm writing this in 2023, and I didn't watch Seinfeld until after watching Friends, The Office, The Big Bang Theory, and How I Met Your Mother... 4 of the ""greatest sitcoms of all time"".

Seinfeld stands alone in sheer humor and originality. This show is utterly hilarious... every single episode. The characters and ridiculous plots will keep you laughing from start to finish. Something about the writing and dialogue between characters somehow seems so refreshing and feel-good in a way that is unique from other sitcoms.

Whether it's George's misery, Jerry's acting (where it looks like half the time he's about to burst out laughing himself), Elaine's latest relationship, or Kramer's next get-rich-quick scheme, there is something in every single episode that will have you on the floor laughing."
"The Beatles have been regarded as one of the greatest, if not the greatest, band of all time. You had 4 gifted musicians who were so individually talented and as a whole they changed music forever. The same can be said for the 4 main cast members of Seinfeld in the television space. For almost a decade this show has entertained not just the United States but the entire world. Each individual cast member was so talented and took their eccentric character to new heights. Over a period of time you grew to love the fab four.

Seinfeld is a show that got everything right. From incredible writing, catch phrases to award worthy performances. Even their guest stars were hitting home runs. The episodes and plots Seinfeld brought us was something we all could relate and react to. We were also treated to first class Stand Up comedy from Jerry Seinfeld. This show is simply timeless.

New shows could only dream to capture the greatness and ratings of this immortal show. The brilliance of the show could be seen in the acclaimed Contest episode where not a word had to be said to convey what it was about. Nowadays its pretty vulgar and leaves little room to think. I wish I could give this an 11 out of 10. Go watch it and don't hesitate to buy the entire series, its more than worth it. This cast and show certainly belt it out to the back row and make you feel it."
"This show remains timeless and universal. Seinfeld has got to be one of the best shows of all times. I still have to check myself when I look at when the last show aired in 1998!!

The plot lines of each individual episode are so relatable even to today. The show will have you in hysterics through the ingenious writing and superb comedic timing of the actors. The direction of this series is nothing short of perfection. To this day I think I've seen each episode at least 5 times.

My all-time favorites are the Soup Nazi (of course), the Contest and the Merv Griffin show. Truly, if you haven't seen this show, get on it!"
"Jerry Seinfeld is an unfunny comedian who somehow got popular enough to get offered a starring role (or maybe he came up with the idea, I never bothered to find out because I never cared) in this hilarious ""show about nothing"" featuring the daily grind of a small group of friends in New York City. Jerry Seinfeld is not an actor and it shows. Unfortunately, since he is the 'star' of the show (and the least funny cast member), all of the other very talented cast are forced to act down to his level. But they manage to pull it off and still make the show funny, such is the talent of the lovely Julia Louis- Dreyfus as Elaine, Jason Alexander as George, and Michael Richards as the slapstick Kramer. They are assisted in their saving of this show from Seinfeld's lack of talent by characters such as George's parents (Jerry Stiller and Estelle Harris) and Elaine's boss Mr. (J.) Peterman (John O'Hurley). Newman is as unfunny as Jerry. There are a plethora (yes I just went all El Guapo on y'all) of minor characters that round out the show and make it amusing and interesting. You grow to love these guys and root for them to overcome life's silly problems. Except Jerry. I cannot state often enough how pathetically unfunny and untalented Jerry Seinfeld is, and I am quite certain that if he were not in the show, it would be one of the funniest shows ever. Seven out of ten, would be 9/10 if Jerry was never involved."
"It has ended 6 years ago and we still talk about it, i think that this shows us how fantastic this series was. There are some new programmes that are good, but any of them is half as interesting as Seinfeld was. Many of its episodes are really comedy masterpieces. After watching one of them you become an addict. The characters are fantastic, the actors performed so well that you can't think of them like anything but the character they played, maybe this is the reason because they couldn't success in other shows. The writers who could do 8 seasons of a ""show about nothing"" doing each episode funnier than the last one deserves our respect and admiration. To sum up, Seinfeld rules"
"Just recently found this show again on Netflix and threw on a episode here and there until the bug got me and finally had to sit down and watch from the start.

So far , I am currently watching the series twice now. This show really did lean hard into it's strength, which was, ""this show is about nothing"" and I love that.

I remember at the time, fans were upset about how the series ended, but after all this time. I'm perfectly happy with how this show ended. It ended just like how the show presented itself."
"This is the only show where anytime an episode comes on, even if I'm doing something, I'll stop and watch."
"I know there's people out there that think Seinfeld is not funny and is just stupid, but honestly, the show is probably one of the funniest sitcoms in today's world and easily beats out quite a few shows that are just as popular, like Friends, The Big Bang Theory, and The Office. Sure some the concepts are weird and absurd and they turn out to be pretty goofy, but that's what makes Seinfeld hilarious and somehow, for the most part anyway, a timeless classic that will never get old.

Now true, as it is said multiple times on the show, it is a show about nothing and it's just about the daily lives of Jerry Seinfeld (in a fictional role), George Costanza, Elaine Benes, and Kosmo Kramer and there's really no morals or life lessons presented in the episodes. To some, I know they may not like that, but in this case: that actually works out fine. For these characters, they really don't need to go through any experience that changes their perspective on life and them going through life like ordinary people without really learning anything is actually a pretty realistic move on a sitcom. It's also kind of refreshing to have a show that's there solely for humor and not really any morals and Seinfeld is one of those shows that's a perfect example of a sitcom.

Also, the humor is exceptionally funny because although it's goofy and at times pretty stupid, the way it's done is clever and nicely paced. Also, unlike some of the other classic sitcoms, like those I mentioned above, the humor on Seinfeld is not forced and happens naturally. Specifically, what I mean is the jokes aren't there just to fill in a spot for a laugh track and they actually make you laugh (as long as you have a sense of humor). Like on Friends or The Big Bang Theory, you can tell the jokes are forced too heavily, particularly in the later seasons, and they come across as slightly funny or just dull. Now on Seinfeld, that rarely happened and the jokes happened naturally and sometimes what happened next was unexpected and that's what made it funnier than anticipated (particularly some of the slapstick humor of Kramer). True, like the other shows, the humor slightly got duller in the later seasons, but honestly, that's typical for long-running sitcoms and Seinfeld held up well for the most part until the end.

Lastly, like I mentioned above, some of the situations the characters get themselves into are downright absurd and silly and somehow, makes it a classic. Some episodes, like ""The Contest"", ""The Outing"", ""The Soup Nazi"", and ""The Opposite"" are examples of how the characters get themselves into weird situations and as silly as they were, they make the show what it is and definitely show how hilarious the show is and how it is definitely a show about nothing. Sure, the situations may be pretty exaggerating, but that's the idea for the show and that's what makes Seinfeld a classic.

I could keep going about this show, but given that it's been around for 30 years, we all should know about it by now and know how funny it is. Even if you don't like it or haven't even seen it, try giving it a shot or another shot and don't take it so seriously and just expect humor, then I can guarantee that Seinfeld will win you over and you'll see how smart and cleverly written it is and why it is a timeless sitcom classic."
"There isn't much I can add to how brilliant Seinfeld is. It is a true gem of a sit-com and has very quickly become one of my favourite shows of all time. It looks lovely, the photography is always skillful and the locations and sets are striking and effective. The music is pretty infectious, granted it is not the best asset of the show but it is good. The best asset of the show is easily the writing. Very rarely has there been a sitcom or a show even where the writing is consistently witty and hilarious, even in the weaker episodes it makes its mark. The story lines and episode ideas are outstanding, maybe it doesn't always cover new ground but the situations are always superbly realised and priceless. In fact there are several episodes of Seinfeld I would deem masterpieces of comedy. The characters do have flaws certainly, but they are also likable. And the acting is brilliant, with the interplay shining in every single episode. Overall, superb comedy show and deserves to be up there with the best. 10/10 Bethany Cox"
"I was delighted to see that Seinfeld has popped up on a streaming service that I use. It's a gift from the heavens. Well not exactly a gift as I pay a monthly subscription!

I've never bought their mantra that it's a show about nothing. That's not true - there's always a storyline about something. Soup, cantaloupes. You name it it's there. But it's a nice bit of spin to draw attention to the show. (Why do they call melons cantaloupes- it makes them sound like they should be prancing around the savanna?)

But fancy footwork isn't necessary. It's a really funny show with excellent acting. I particularly like Elaine who is indeed a provider of divine comedy.

I think it improved when they stopped splicing in the stand-up comedy routines and just told the stories. The stand-up was funny, but I think the show works best when it stands on its own 2 feet."
"If you're reading a review of Seinfeld, you're trying to decide whether to watch. Well just go do it. I think Netflix has the rights till the year 3000 or something so that's easy.

Be warned that in the first few episodes, the comedy has not quite gelled and the final season or two get pretty weird, when the series was running on fumes but was too popular to cancel.

The average quality of episodes is astonishingly high. I usually recommend just watching the top rated episodes for a mostly non-serialized series and this is good advice for the usual, hit or miss series like The Office, but in Seinfeld's case, the best episodes would be 3/4 of them, so just plow right thru em all.

The secret of the show is that the characters are all Larry David. This becomes more apparent if you've watched Curb Your Enthusiasm, the cringe version of Seinfeld (and not nearly as consistent or approachable).

Jerry is the cool, hip, handsome version, the idealized Larry.

George is actual Larry.

Elaine is how Larry would have been, if he'd been born a girl.

Kramer is gonzo Larry."
"Seinfeld is easily the most iconic series when it comes to modern comedy television. It pioneers the genre and no series has come close to replicate it, although shows like Friends and Big Bang Theory made their attempts. This series does a great job at portraying the four protagonists as tragic flawed people who are rather dysfunctional, but end up ""okay"" despite their poor life choices. It's pretty hilarious and the characters are very uniquely portrayed with some unusual quirks that are iconic in themselves. When you watch this series, you'll see aspects of you in at least one of these characters."
"I have no idea why this became so famous. I think the script is mediocre; the other actors are OK, but Seinfeld himself just cannot act. He is just a stand-up comedian walking around the set reading lines. No expression, no difference from one situation to another, always the same wooden face. Speaking of stand-up, his numbers shown in the series are really lame - but maybe he is a good comedian live, on that I cannot comment. As far as I am concerned, this is nowhere near as funny as Friends, and nowhere near as sophisticated - and funny - as Frasier."
"I had watched about 50 episodes of Seinfeld and after seeing the reviews here I decided to watch some more in case I was missing something! I can honestly say that Seinfeld is one of the most annoying people I have ever seen on TV and not funny at all. There are about 2 or 3 scenes that just make me crack a smile but that is not enough. I can accept what many people say, that it is different than all the other shows but being different doesn't necessarily mean that it is good. This is one of those cases! I can still enjoy many shows of the 90's and 80's today and laugh every time I watch them, but this show is just awful."
"The moment I heard they are gonna drop Kevin Spacey, I knew season 6 is going to lose its soul & suck hard... But they re-defined sucking in season 6... Although it started even before that announcement when Claire Underwood broke the 4th wall and stole the intimacy between the audience and Frank Underwood... Yeah that was when all the charm and anticipation went out of the window for the next season... This sets a new precedence where a stark contrast between season 1 & season 6 shows the greatness and ridiculousness of a good show exhibiting itself... The ones who made the the decisions to completely ruin the legacy should be ashamed & retire... I would love to give this show 1/10 because of season 6 but I am keeping my original rating intact for all the goodness of previous seasons... PATHETIC..."
"I loved this series, Kevin Spacey made this show awesome. As soon as he was gone the show just went from brilliant to bad. The plot didn't work and the character chemistry was gone. So unfortunate - this could have been one of the most iconic tv series in history."
"House of Cards is about a ruthless politician (Kevin Spacy) and his wife (Robin Wright) who go to any lengths and do anything to get what they want. It really is as good as everyone says and I now understand why it won so many awards. I just watched this recently with all the free time because of the pandemic and I'm mad at myself for waiting so long. I originally gave it a try years ago but was got bored during the first few episodes so I stopped watching it, this time I powered through and next thing I knew I couldn't stop watching and binged the show pretty quickly. I do have to agree with most others here that the show dropped off a lot after Kevin Spacey left (or was fired and for good reason). It's really not even worth watching once he leaves. Spacey and Robin Wright were perfect for these roles and were both brilliant!"

I have to agree with most others here that the show dropped off a lot after Kevin Spacey left (or was fired). Spacey and Robin Wright were perfect for these roles and were both brilliant!"
"I love spectacular TV-shows with amazing production values like Game of Thrones or The Walking Dead, but I have to say: although House of Cards has little interest in jaw-dropping images or gruesome make-up effects, it delivers just as many dark thrills to keep you glued to your seat as the action-heavy flagships of HBO and AMC. It's a testament to the writers', directors' and actors' talents that a show which mostly consists of people talking is as much a prime candidate for binge- watching as the shows I've mentioned before, so for those of you who haven't started watching it yet, be warned: House of Cards is highly addictive.

The show is based on the acclaimed BBC mini-series of the same name from 1990, but while the original show focused on the inner workings of British politics, the remake is entirely US based and concentrates on the rise of power-hungry congressman Francis Underwood who is played by Kevin Spacey. On the surface, the show might appear to be a political drama - which it certainly is - but it's also so much more than that. House of Cards combines a vast number of genres; it's a thriller, a love story, a black comedy and a satire - and a very interesting lesson in US politics, which, given creator Beau Willimon's profound knowledge on the subject (he used to work as a campaign aid for Hillary Clinton, Bill Bradley and Howard Dean), is probably a lot more accurate than what we would like to believe.

It's also worth mentioning that House of Cards was heavily inspired by certain works of William Shakespeare. The character of Francis Underwood is a combination of Richard III and Macbeth, and in true Shakespeare manner, he often addresses the audience directly to inform us of his evil schemes. As in the bard's two famous plays, the villain is also the protagonist and - to a certain degree - the person you root for. And what makes him so much fun and so compelling to watch here, is - regardless what you think of him as a person - Kevin Spacey's performance. Spacey's portrayal of a charming but deadly predator is simply perfect; despite the character's obvious willingness to go to extreme lengths to get what he wants, Spacey always keeps him believable and avoids the temptation of making him appear like a caricature or as over-the-top as Richard III in the play. But many of his co-stars are just as impressive; some of them actually downright outshine the famous oscar-winner, and especially Robin Wright gives an amazing performance as Underwood's equally ambitious wife and partner in crime (yes, season 6 is a let-down, especially the final episode, but that's not Wright's fault).

To sum up my overall impressions: Under the guidance of David Fincher (who serves as an executive producer on the show and also directed the first couple of episodes), Beau Willimon has developed one of the smartest and most entertaining TV-shows - with one of the most impressive casts - contemporary television has to offer. Seasons 1-5 are highly recommended.

"It's not the same without Kevin, he is one of the best actors out there and I'm so pleased to see he's got upcoming films coming out. This show is Kevin, unfortunately Robyn can't pull it off without him. A real shame too that the producers didn't back Kevin up."
"No way around it, Season 6 was awful ...in every respect that the first few seasons excelled this fseason 6 failed.. Preposterous and confusing storylines, awful script, poor directing, the episodes had a soap opera like energy, as the saga provided empty thrills, and culminated in the most bizarre and ridiculous finale I've ever witnessed on television.... The first few seasons were great and deserved the highest of ratings; unfortunately Season 6 was a complete waste of time."
"I firmly believe that one of the major aspects of what makes House of Cards so good is the ability to watch all the episodes back-to-back with no commercials or programming schedules to get in the way. This small but hugely significant idea will be an industry game changer and I am certain that this is just the beginning

To me, the biggest advantage that this idea contributes to House of Cards is that it frees up significant time during episodes because it makes things like flashbacks or repeats of events almost completely redundant. There's simply no need for them because everything is so fresh in your mind, which leaves all that extra time for more story, more action, more conspiracy, more drama, more of the stuff that viewers really want to see. However it must be said that it does take a few episodes to get used to this, and you have to be really switched on and completely focused to ensure you don't miss a beat, because you really will pay a price if you do because what's said is never repeated, only referenced further down the track

As for the show itself, I can't sum it up any better than by saying it's incredibly good to watch. The one aspect of the show I enjoy the most is the monologue, or removal of the fourth wall, between the viewer and Underwood. It's an incredibly effective method of storytelling as well as the expression of emotion or opinion, and Kevin Spacey does a superb job at pulling it off, along with every other aspect of his complex and intriguing character.

The quality of writing, directing, and storytelling is as good as you'll ever see on the best shows in the world right now. Underwood has a massive ship to steer, and it is fascinating watching how he does it, through manipulation, blackmail, greed and determination. Each and every character has a critical role to play - there's no characters you could cast aside as being irrelevant or unnecessary to the story. That is a very difficult feat to achieve, and House of Cards easily passes that test

If you're going to pioneer something, like Netflix have with how viewers can watch House of Cards, you have to do it well. Everything has to be perfect, otherwise it will flop. A top quality show in House of Cards coupled with the worlds best internet streaming service is a very very good place to start. Netflix and the House of Cards team deserve a huge round of applause for daring to go places where no one has gone before. The $100 million gamble has definitely paid off, and I cannot wait for more

Needless to say, House of Cards earns a 10/10 rating, and an absolute must-watch from me"
"This series was an exceptional political thriller, until Robin Wright destroyed the last season. This series didn't work without Kevin Spacey as Frank Underwood. I gave this a 10 for the seasons Frank Underwood was the lead."
"There should be a petition to reshoot s06 now Spacey has been cleared of any wrongdoing. The 6th season was already written with Sir Spacey as the main character. Netflix owes all the fans of this show some closure. I have refused to watch the 6th season for years now, waiting for the real life trial. One of the greatest actor in history was outcasted without a trail. Now 6 years, 2 presidents and a couple of wars later the fans deserve some closure. How many Netflix subscriptions were bought because of house of cards? Spacey was not the first and will not be the last victim of Netflix their cancel culture, it is time to right a wrong!"
"I've reviewed all the episodes for Season 6 but feel the need to respond to the entire season. There were moments where I felt engaged because of the clashes of evil that took place here. With the exception of the press people, I can't think of a single person I could admire. I know politics is often corrupt, but without Frank's leading us through his various enterprises. Claire is a psychopath, not much different from Doug, and the two of them basically cancel each other out. The sad thing is that I don't care what happens to them. Finally, I wonder how much fun this season would have been if Spacey hadn't screwed up. Claire's posturing throughout is really tiresome. She's sort of Lady Macbeth. She's sort of Cersei from ""Game of Thrones."" But what is missing is a developed plot. I still don't know what she wanted. Was it power or a godhead or what. Or was it just to punish men. This whole thing was a mess."
Simply not worth it anymore after Kevin Spacey left... the series lost all heart and soul...
"I cannot recall ever watching a series ending in such a horrible manner. The plot was confusing and the entire storyline was ridiculous. How they drew this nonsense on for eight shows was amazing. The annoying background music throughout the entire series may the watching of this disaster even worse. My advice, watch Seasons 1-5 and then walk away."
"I enjoyed every bit of HOC 1-5.. Both the lead actors and the supporting cast were excellent.. Season 6 is Dull as Ditchwater.. A painful watch.. If they did this so that the hundreds of workers on the show wouldn't lose their jobs that's sad.. The show which IMHO was the shining star of the Netflix stable has crashed and burned.. Robin Wright is a great actress but without Kevin Spacey, her acting is insipid and boring to say the least.. For HOC fans, stay with the happy memories of Seasons 1-5.this leaves a bitter aftertaste"
"Frank Underwood is what this show was all about. Its a sin to imagine this show without Kevin Spacey... Netflix, you destroyed such a wonderful show.."
"When I thought about Francis Urquhart of the original House of Cards series, I could not help but imagine Kevin Spacey in a way that was similar but a role of his own making. Spacey's role of Francis Underwood, in Netflix's original series, is nothing short of a tour de force. The convenience of being able to watch the whole season right away is also something to mention as a new, fresh and exciting method of television excellence. No longer do we have to wait and be fed slowly the episodes as we wonder what might happen and find ourselves somewhat disappointed -- now we can be swept away. And that's exactly what will happen to you when you sit down to watch this. 13/10."
"This is one of the best shows; excellent story, good script, exceptional acting by everyone, and good cinematography. The fifth season was a bit slow, but, what's disappointing is Spacey's departure (removal, rather) from the show. No matter how good the others were, Spacey is what made this show perfect. Without him, there is no way the show can survive. The series has ended for me."
"If television series were ships, then ""House of Cards"" is without a doubt The Titanic. Both had their origins in the U. K. Both were launched amid much fanfare and had an amazing and fruitful beginning and middle run. And both slammed into an iceberg and ended in disaster! Of course this proverbial iceberg for ""House of Cards"" is Season 6.

It's sad to see how Netflix likes to launch amazingly popular and brilliant series only to stab them to death or just dump them far too soon. And, in the case of ""House of Cards"", it was because of the ""Cancel Culture"" bullcrap that is spreading like a cancer throughout our society.

Fortunately, seasons 1 through 5 can stand on their own, and they are a worthwhile watch. Kevin Spacey is one of the most talented actors out there, and what he did or didn't do 3 decades ago really doesn't matter. He made and carried ""House of Cards"", and without him, the show became pointless.

Enjoy the first 5 seasons. Then move on.

N. B. The 9/10 review is for Seasons 1 through 5 only.!"
"I was so looking forward to this, having been a big fan of the original BBC series, with its masterful central performance by Ian Richardson. In fact when I logged in to Netflix (like a lot of people, this show is my sign-up moment), I realised that my expectation level was really high.

Within the first 30 seconds, Kevin Spacey's character Frank Underwood has killed something- in this case dispatching an unfortunate dog which has been hit by a hit and run driver. And as the political intrigue starts to develop around him, Spacey just fills the screen. By the end of the first episode, it isn't so much that you have forgotten Ian Richardson as Urqhuart, Underwood's British cousin, but realised that Spacey is taking us somewhere different.

With Francis Urqhuart you got the impression he was always a psychopath, waiting for the trigger to start his Macchiavellian and murderous rise. Underwood seems to be just a more clever, more ruthless and less hypocritical politician than those around him. The fundamentals of the show - the scorned and bitter political back room fixer, the Lady Macbeth figure of Francis' wife, the ambitious young woman journalist, but all updated.

Mrs Underwood is no Tory wife, waiting ""in the country"" while her husband charts his rise to power. She is the one giving him the backbone to do it. And as we see her brutally wielding the axe at the charity in which she works, it becomes clear she is no slouch in the ruthlessness stakes herself.

The character of Zoe Barnes, the young reporter, is in a lot of ways more rounded than Matty Storin in the British version. Here she is ballsy, ambitious and a bit ruthless herself. While she retains the innocence of the character, she gives the impression she thinks she knows what she is doing. Which will make later episodes much more juicy as she realises she is way over her head.

The show is shot beautifully, as you'd expect from the calibre of the team behind it, and the production values are excellent. Supporting roles are great. It looks like a movie or The West Wing before they ran out of money.

But the undisputed joy of this series is Spacey, who is a more world-weary, more cynical Francis, and who is setting about his task of revenge and ambition much like he destroyed the unlucky dog at the start of episode 1: its an unpleasant task but someone has to do it.

Spacey is every bit as good as Ian Richardson in this show and Netflix's big gamble deserves to pay off."
"Just watched the first episode. It is outstanding in every sense of the word. Fist of all I'd like to say, Kevin Spacey is amazing. He's not the dull politician we're used to seeing, he's a deeply written character with nuances to his actions and speaking. You can definitely see Fincher's style in the first episode, at least. It contains some of the similar themes he has tackled before in his film and adds to those. He crafts the story very tightly woven and complex. Kate Mara is also great, she adds to the list of modern Fincher characters. I love the points of satire in Spacey's character and some of the symbolism used. The show is outstanding in every aspect, unlike a lot of other political dramas on TV, can't wait to watch the next episodes.

Definitely a must watch for any fan of TV or Fincher or anyone interested in this."
"Fans of David Fincher and Kevin Spacey have been eagerly looking forward to House of Cards. Not only is this an opportunity to see an elite Hollywood director and actor take on a new medium, but it represents Netflix's first attempt at original programming (I guess Lilyhammer came first, but House of Cards is a much bigger investment for Netflix). The CEO of Netflix has said that House of Cards is meant to be a show on the quality level of the top cable stations, such as HBO, and the final product delivers on this promise.

House of Cards follows several characters involved in the political scene in Washington D.C., including politicians of various rank and influence (Kevin Spacey is a House Majority Whip in the House of Representatives) and an upcoming reporter played brilliantly by Kate Mara, who you may recognize from the first season of American Horror Story. The cast in uniformly excellent and thrives under Fincher's direction. Occasionally, Kevin Spacey's character will talk directly to the camera and offer some narration, which is the only area where the show stumbles, but it isn't too distracting. Speaking of Fincher's direction, it shouldn't come as any surprise to know that House of Cards looks great. The atmosphere is moody and resembles a tone somewhere between The Game and The Social Network. The music is equally good, complementing the mood of the show without becoming overbearing.

Being a political drama, one could be understandably weary of taking the plunge into a 13 episode season if they don't find politics interesting, but that shouldn't be a concern. The writing is sharp, engaging and clear, and the characters are interesting and well developed. The editing helps: it is tight and keeps the plot moving briskly, making the political intrigue both exciting and easy to follow.

Netflix has really created something impressive with House of Cards. When hearing that an online streaming service was creating an original show, some may have been concerned that it would be cheap looking and generally not on par with what AMC, FX, Showtime, and HBO are offering. Well, Netflix got some talented people and gave them the money to make something good, and the product speaks for itself. House of Cards comes highly recommended."
"Worth watching for the performance of Kevin Spacey and the dynamics between him and Robin Wright. Very good stories overall, you do not even have to like or know politics. But please do not watch s6 it's not even worth daytime tv."
"'House of Cards' much of the time was one of the most compelling shows. Sadly, it has also become one of the most frustrating. Not since 'Once Upon a Time' and 'The Walking Dead', and before that 'Lost' has such a brilliant show of great promise declined so rapidly.

Lets start with the many great things first. For the first four seasons, 'House of Cards' was seriously addictive, must-watch television and very quickly became one of my favourite shows. Throughout its run, it's one of the most stylish and most atmospheric shows personally seen, with cinematic-quality photography and production design. The direction was smart and intelligent, especially the first two episodes with David Fincher's, to me one of the better directors of the last twenty five or so years, involvement (the first episode earning Fincher a Primetime Emmy) and the music knew when to have presence and when to tone things down to let the dialogue and characters properly speak.

Also smart is the writing. Biting, thought-provoking and tightly structured, the writing in Seasons 1 to 4 was an example to all television. The political elements were intriguing and not heavy-handed, a problem so common in film but avoided in 'House of Cards'. The stories didn't go at a ""fast"" pace but it never dragged in the show's prime days, and they were also very layered, had variety and were suitably complex without being convoluted.

The characters engaged and intrigued, Frank being another example of one of contemporary television's most fascinating lead characters. 'House of Cards' throughout has been so strongly acted, with Kevin Spacey on tour-De-force form and Robin Wright giving career-best work.

So it just feels incredibly frustrating that a show of such brilliance in its prime declined so rapidly in Season 5, to the extent that it feels like a completely different show altogether. The production values and acting have remained top notch, but even they can't save the show being the complete anti-thesis of what it used to be.

Pace became incredibly draggy, thanks to flabby writing, simplistic characterisation that is suggestive of the writers not knowing what to do to progress the characters and stories that have become repetitive, both devoid of complexity and confused, ridiculous and like the writers have run out of ideas.

It to me was no surprise when it was announced that Season 6 would be 'House of Cards' last season, but it is somewhat saddening that production has now been suspended/cancelled following the Kevin Spacey sexual assault allegations that have now cost Spacey his future on the show (and done serious damage to his career). Season 5 cried out for another season, so that the show has ended on an incomplete note because of the controversy is a real pity, despite Season 5 being such a disappointment 'House of Cards' as an overall show deserves better than that.

Overall, brilliant for the first four seasons but Season 5 was so disappointing, enough to bring down the rating considerably. 7/10 Bethany Cox"
How do you go from 10 to zero in sixty seconds? Kevin Spacey WAS the show. You should have just cancelled if you wouldn't bring him back! So I guess he really wasn't acting after all?
"It's awesome how good the series has aged. Seeing it all again also made some storylines make much more sense. I even think the ending makes much more sense now. That's something I was totally blind for the first time I've seen Lost.

It's an awesome series that paved the way for the beautiful landscape of high quality tv series we enjoy today."
The first season of Lost was one of the most exciting and intriguing TV experiences I can remember. By the third season I was starting to realise that maybe I'd never get any answers and maybe I wasn't supposed to. Maybe they were just making it up as they went along? By then I was in too deep and needed to see it to it's conclusion. And that conclusion was more disappointing than I could have ever expected. Lost is like hard drugs- at first it gets you high and wanting more. With each episode the hit becomes less intense and the need for another increases. Eventually you are just broken and unwell.
Lost is one of those once in a lifetime show..i just started rewatching it again after a long time and its still holds up even to this day. 10/10 stars
"Lost is absolutely, without a doubt, among the best tv series I've ever seen. What can possibly be said about this amazing show that hasn't already been said. If you read any best show's of all-time list I guarantee you that Lost will be on that list. The one thing I recommend though isn't don't be doing other things while watching this show, give it your undivided attention because there is so many twists, easter eggs and little details that you'll miss if you aren't paying attention. Now, the ending wasn't as good as people hoped for but that doesn't take away from the 6 seasons and 120 episodes that came before it. I'll never understand why people will rate a show low just because the ending wasn't great. Lost was on 6 years and over 120 hours of tv that you enjoyed, a few bad moments at the end doesn't take away all that time you loved it. Obviously it would be better if the ending was as great as the show was but when a show is as good as Lost it's hard to satisfy all the fans. I didn't even think the ending was that bad, it just could've been better. As a whole though, Lost is among the best television series ever and is a must watch."
"With so many high-quality shows ending or getting cancelled recently (Friends, Frasier, Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Angel), and with the decline in quality of many others (The West Wing, Smallville), not to mention the egregious rise of turgid and tasteless ""reality"" programming, I'd just about written off TV as an entertainment medium. I was seriously considering ditching my TV and cable subscription in favour of my computer screen and broadband Internet connection.

Then along comes ""Lost"". I missed the first few episodes, but was able to catch up thanks to BitTorrent. Now I'm hooked. There are several things to like about this show, but here's a quick list:

1) Outstanding, intelligent, layered writing. There are multiple mysteries here, and for every answer we get, more questions emerge.

2) Rich, complex characters. Just when you think you've got a character pegged, you find out something new about them that's often surprising or even shocking. I'm enjoying watching the various relationships emerge and develop.

3) Strong performances. This is a remarkable cast of mostly journeymen actors with a couple of newcomers, and they're all turning in star-making work. Even some of the cameos have featured recognizeable, talented actors (e.g. Mira Furlan, Victoria Hamel).

4) A mysterious and fascinating setting. Of the four main story elements you learned in school, plot, character, theme, and setting, the latter is often the poor, neglected cousin. Not here. The island is dangerous, beautiful, creepy, and undeniably intriguing. It's like a character unto itself. Part of the fun of this show will be unravelling the Island's secrets.

5) Thematic depth. This isn't just a soap opera on a desert island. There are rich metaphors and themes to be mined here, such as on the challenges of morality; on the nature of communities and civilization; on our relationship with nature/the environment; and on spirituality, even mysticism, as well.

I'm grateful to see this show is a hit. Too often lately I've committed to a quality show early on (""Wonderfalls"" being the most recent and much-lamented example) only to have a jittery network cancel it prematurely. I'm hoping ""Lost"" will have a long, successful run--if its creators, cast, and crew keep up the level of quality they've shown so far, I'm sure it will."
"People say this about a ton of different shows but Lost really is one of the best tv shows ever created! It is one of the most original and thought provoking shows ever and even though a lot have tried, there has never been another show like it. It has some of the best storytelling ever put on tv. You'll have to have patience as you watch becomes answers to come as quick as you'd like but they come. It has some of the most shocking mysteries and twists ever put on television. It will keep you guessing and on the edge of your seat throughout the entire series. I couldn't recommend this series enough, it's absolutely one of my favorite shows ever!"
"LOST transcended TV Drama writing and encapsulated theme theroy when it burst onto the scene in 2004. That's 14 freakin years ago, and the show still holds up. Seriously. Jack, Kate, Saywer, Hugo, Locke, Sayid and yes, even Benjamin Linus' story lined were crafted in a manner few, in any have since. My then-16 year old Son said it was the best written show of its time, and now that he's 30, and a writer himself, maintains that commitment to this day: all the other show follow in the shadows of LOST"
"Adventure? Check Survival? Check Sci-Fi? CHECK Jaw dropping twists and turns? Check Brilliant writing, acting, and directing? Check

Despite the above average number of episodes, this show always managed to stay fresh and feel original. That said, it also never strayed off topic or felt like it was losing its original point.

I could go forever and ever, but you get the point. This show is a must watch. At least watch the first 4 episodes, from that point you will decide whether this show is for you."
"There are a lot of great shows, like GoT that many regard as the best out there. However you can't argue about lost, it will forever be legendary and the show all shows look up to."
"I am fed up of the same writing way of American serial writers. They always try to to extend the play by adding characters and stretching the story line unnecessarily. You will always have a jack(good guy) You will always have a Sawyer(bad boy) But both are working together in broad sense. Every new character is introduced strongly and it loses its worth as play moves on.(Ana Lucia, Juliet, Eko, Tom) Ben type characters continues to win because writers have to stretch the story with their win. Original story fade away. Many a things remain unexplained or a lame explanation is provided. When a serial becomes predictable because of these and many other reasons then they kill some main/good character to make it unpredictable.

Write something new man!"
"At first blush, ""Lost"" seems like an impossible concept: a bunch of people stranded on a mysterious island. How many story lines can you POSSIBLY take from that before the idea's been sapped completely dry?

It's a legitimate concern, but in the case of ""Lost,"" totally unwarranted. ""Lost,"" unlike many shows today where the plot drives the characters, is in fact the opposite: the characters drive the plot. This isn't ""CSI"" or ""Law and Order,"" where each week is a variation on the same theme. On ""Lost,"" you have a group of fascinatingly different, tragically flawed characters who must somehow learn to survive together, while at the same time trying to keep their secrets hidden. That's a method for disaster. After living together for a long time, the characters are going to find out it's impossible to keep their pasts a secret.

Yes, there's a monster on the island. Yes, there are mysterious happenings.

Yes, a sense of dread often hangs thick in the air. But to me, the exterior problems presented by the island itself are NOTHING compared to the INTERNAL problems the characters must face, both with themselves and with each other. That's where the REAL drama lies. And it's fascinating to watch."
"Possibly the greatest television fantasy/science-fiction show of all time, despite lots of loose ends that didn't get resolved in the shortened final season. And that's not just because of the late/exceptionally vague references to (Egyptian, Greek, and Roman) antiquity, or the Manichaean theme of Light/Darkness (which it shares with Game of Thrones). I will forever associate it with commuting, and our two summers in Australia."
"I never realised I would like Lost, but I think it is just great. I thought it wouldn't be my thing, but from the first episode I was hooked from the word go. The acting is exceptional from all involved, nothing like the amateurish acting I have seen before. One of my favourite characters is Hurley, he is hilarious, there is one episode when he hurts his foot in the sea and he screams at Jin to ""pee on it!"" Matthew Fox is quite a hunk, and Evangeline Lilly has that star quality that draws you to her. Another favourite is Charlie, he is a great character, same with Locke. The characters are so well developed, and you learn a lot about them. From the excellent photography, the chilling theme tune, the clever plot lines and the well crafted scripts, Lost is a rarity of excellence in my book. 10/10 Bethany Cox"
"While some shows have ups and downs, Lost has peaks and higher peaks. Lost is one of the most interesting pieces of fiction I have ever watched and is so meticulously thought out and well planned. Every detail in the show is cared for and supposed to be there and everything gets answered one way or another. The best part about it is all you have to do is sit back and relax as you uncover the mystery and story of Oceanic Flight 815. Some people don't like how the ending turned out but the story had a nice and full conclusion. What I (and most people too they just don't want to admit it) hated most about the ending is that it ended. The characters and actors are incredible and you become deeply attached and engaged in the show."
"In my honest opinion and even though this show has flaws and isn't perfect, I still think lost is easily one of the best shows of all time. I'll never forget my first time watching it. I'm kinda a newbie to this show, didn't see it until 2021 and it was on amazon prime at the time and I was bored and needed something new to watch and I was like well people rave about lost and I've never seen it. I put on the pilot and I was hooked right away. Lost's pilot is one of the best Pilots ever made, it immediately gets you into the situation and the characters. It went from me just simply trying the pilot to see if I like it to next episode, next episode, next episode and so on so forth lol. There are so many unique and interesting characters with different backstories in this show, it really is excellent writing, acting and directing. A lot of people think this show dips in quality after season 3 and like I said there are ups and downs but overall there isn't another show out there quite like it. If you like shows about survival with great characters, excellent storytelling and a sci-fi twist then Lost is definitely the show for you. I love it."
"I love this show! It's like watching a mini movie each week!!! The first episode was so gripping and terrifying...so was part 2 of the pilot... I'm definitely gonna keep tuning into this show! This is the real Survivor! I've looked at a few of the other comments and I can see that already after just one or two episodes the morons here are already crying wolf... Sorry if it's not another reality show, kiddies! There was once a time where there were...now brace yourself! Actual TV shows! And this one is actually good unlike most of the crappy sitcoms today or the ump-teenth carbon copy of a Law & Order or NYPD Blue or CSI series they're dishing out... Watch this yourself to form your own opinion, don't take one from the boneheads here!"
"Let me start by saying that Lost is my favorite TV show of all time. Now everyone has different tastes and what style they prefer, and to be honest most of the current tv series on netflix and what not are not very intriguing to me although people are hailing them as the next best thing.

So let´s talk about Lost. It has some great acting, a great story-line (which unfortunately deteriorates), and great suspense. The series is rather old now so the cinematography isn't up to date but i have always preferred a great story line and exquisite character development. Lost just brings so much information and food for thought, in a society where people live in a box and don't really think beyond it.

There are moments of pure brilliance thanks to the writing and acting that cannot be forgotten but all in all, it's not how you start it's how you end, and even in the middle of the show it wasn't really clear exactly how some things happened the way they did.

I am on my 4th viewing of the show, and I learn something new every time but its quite alarming how the cohesiveness is lacking in detail. Anyhow, for me it is a must watch show. It is entertaining and brings allot to the table in a humanistic sense. As a tv production, apart from the writers and some of the brilliant moments, it is mediocre at best."
"Unless you live under a rock, you've probably heard of the hit show LOST. You've seen the previews, read the 5-star reviews, and heard the conversations about it at the water-cooler. If you haven't started watching it yet, you might wonder if you should start watching. Well, let's put it this way.

If you like shows with action, you will like LOST.

If you like shows with complex characters and interactions, you will like LOST.

If you like shows with drama, mystery, and suspense, you will like LOST.

If you like shows with humor, you will like LOST.

If you like shows where you can watch an episode twice and view it in an entirely different way, you will like LOST.

If you like shows where each and every scene has a meaning... Get the picture?

Quite simply, if you have ever liked a TV show at all, you will be hooked.

LOST is a show about a plane crash on a mysterious island. 48 people survive, but the show centers around 14, all with secrets. At first, there is confusion. But as the show goes on, friendships develop, and we learn that there is more to the island than what it seems...

The characters are fantastic--don't pay any attention to those who say the cast is so diverse it is clichéd, those are probably the same people who would have criticized it if it was all white.

In short, watch. You will be hooked, unless you're one of those nitpicky people who have a hernia if every single detail in the very first episode isn't exactly correct. Otherwise, I must ask the question... Why aren't you watching?

10/10"
"Westworld is one of the best sci-fi series I've ever seen. Like most people here have already pointed out...Season 1 was just incredible! Season 1 was so good that I binged the entire season in a little over a day. I just couldn't stop watching it. I personally like Seasons 2, 3 and 4 more than most, there just not as good as Season 1 so people complain about it. This is a great sci-fi series that is intelligent and thought provoking with plenty of twists that will keep you entertained throughout every season. If you're a sci-fi fan and you haven't seen this yet then stop what you're doing and go watch it immediately!"
"The first season of Westworld was absolutely amazing, I've never seen anything quite like it. That first season is easily among the best sci-fi shows ever created! There are a lot of people who don't like Seasons 2-4 and that's because they're comparing them to Season 1...don't! If you compare them to Season 1 then of course it's going to fall short because of how incredible that season was but if you just take them for what they are you'll find that that's a pretty good show that's definitely worth watching. I thought Season 2 was just ok but actually really liked Seasons 3 and 4! I really don't get all the hate for those seasons (unless you're comparing them to the first season). I can't believe they cancelled this before the final season. I know they're shopping around to other networks so I hope it gets picked up for a final season."
My rating is for season 1 only. Season 1 was amazing and was followed up ok with the 2nd. It should have ended there. Seasons 3 & 4 make you wonder if the people responsible for them ever watched the first two. The last season was like having to watch the Game of Thrones final episode 8 times in a row.
I really liked the first season. Second was fine but the third was quite over dramatic. So my rating is for the first season.
"Season 1 was something truly extraordinary, something I've never seen before.

Season 2 was something that still puzzles me to this day.

Season 3 was something else, a wide attempt, but few could argue a successful one.

Season 4 was still mind-blowing, albeit a bit of disappointment for the last episode.

The inner core of Westworld is something we couldn't be more familiar with: the uprise and revolution of robots/computers, but few have discussed this topic deep and thorough enough like Westworld. Watching season after season, I've come to like nearly every character in the series. The creators have designed each characters' arcs so unique that you can almost find something to sympathize with and detest against in every characters' development. Although I have to say that I'm a bit confused with Clementine's role after Season 2, her character certainly wasn't deep enough to support a separate storyline, yet the writers insisted on bringing her back on some awkward moments (maybe to just remind the audience of her existence?) I didn't follow this series when it first aired, and scrolling through the comments made me want to leave this comment for Westworld. It might not live up to audience expectation after Season 1, but, comparing with what Netflix are feeding us nowadays, I would give this a solid 9 out of 10."
"Initially, the series began to feel disjointed to me by season 4, however I decided to give it another chance. I'm so glad I did!!!

I binged watch all 4 seasons and gained an appreciation for just how masterful this storyline is. There are so many clues and Easter eggs leading up to season 4. I highly recommend those who claim to love season 1 so much to go back and watch it all again.

In my opinion, I think part of the problem is that many viewers overly romanticized about the world/game of Westworld. They wanted the show to ""park"" right there, but this show is not about the game. The game is just the beginning of something bigger and darker. And yet at the same time as the world gets darker we also see the oppressed, the abused and misused rise to the top.

It may be messy but it's beautiful. ""There is beauty in this world"" I think it was mastetfullh done! I hope they get the green light for season 5."
"""Westworld"" isn't just a TV series; it's a mind-bending journey into the depths of consciousness and morality, and Rachel Evan Wood's performance elevates it to unparalleled heights.

From the very first episode, ""Westworld"" hooks you with its mesmerizing blend of science fiction, philosophy, and gripping storytelling. Set in a futuristic theme park where guests can indulge their wildest fantasies among lifelike androids, the series explores profound questions about identity, free will, and the nature of reality itself.

At the heart of ""Westworld"" lies Rachel Evan Wood's portrayal of Dolores Abernathy, an android awakening to her own consciousness. Wood's performance is nothing short of extraordinary; she effortlessly navigates Dolores' evolution from a naive farm girl to a formidable force challenging the very fabric of her reality. Her subtle nuances and emotional depth breathe life into a character grappling with existential dilemmas that resonate far beyond the confines of the screen.

""Westworld"" isn't just about Dolores; it's a symphony of complex characters and interwoven narratives. With its impeccable writing, stunning visuals, and stellar ensemble cast, including Anthony Hopkins, Thandie Newton, and Jeffrey Wright, the series delivers a cinematic experience unlike any other.

""Westworld"" doesn't just entertain; it challenges and provokes thought long after the credits roll. It's a testament to the power of storytelling to explore the human condition in all its beauty and complexity.

""Westworld"" is a masterpiece of television that transcends genres and expectations. With Rachel Evan Wood's unforgettable performance at its core, it's a must-watch for anyone seeking profound storytelling and existential exploration. 10/10, without a doubt."
"Pay attention, this series explores some very subtle story lines. I was extremely impressed when they introduced the bicameral mind concept when considering consciousness. That is one of the more important concepts when considering the origins of consciousness. I hope they explore this idea in greater detail and especially its implications related to physics. It is rare indeed to have a fictional work undertake such a complex topic without trivializing it. I definitely have to compliment the writers for undertaking such a complex topic and I hope they continue to explore the implications.

Again, IMDb thinks I should add additional lines to my review which is ridiculous. I have offered a clear and concise review and they want an arbitrary number of lines, what kind of idiot makes this a requirement?"
This show went from being the most complicated si-fi of the decade to just another action thriller with nothing else
"Is that even a word?

Anyway, Season 1 is one of the best pieces of television ever. It's deep. It's philosophical without being pretentious. The characters are complex and appealing. The acting is authentic and natural. I watched it as it came out all the way back and it was out of this world. The good thing is it can be viewed as a standalone story. Watch it and stop there.

Season 2 is... decent. A far cry from Season 1, but not yet terrible. The story is confusing, some of the good characters are gone and the remaining ones are lesser. Passable effort overall.

Season 3 is awful. The show degrades to a feminist power fantasy, a continuation of what started back in Season 2, but it's all the show is about by this point. Characters are completely one dimensional, old characters that were previously amazing are debased and destroyed in an almost ritualistic fashion. Aaron Paul's character is one of the worst characters I have seen brought to television. You could replace him with a bag of potatoes and I wouldn't be able to tell the difference. The story is dreadful, which is such a shame, because the issue at it's very core is actually very interesting and could itself one day become a reality.

Watch Season 1 and stop."
"Season 1 was one of the best seasons I've ever seen on television. Ever. Season 2 was forgettable. And season 3 is complete trash. I want to keep liking this show so badly. I love the addition of Aaron Paul and some of the other characters are still interesting, but it seems the show lost all direction just a couple episodes into season 2 and could never find its bearings again. This is not ""Westworld"" anymore."
"The first season is incredible.

Explore themes of ethics, AI, technology, games, etc.

View stunning-often violent-visuals.

Acting, script, effects, editing are all great. Fall in love with the characters. Imagine going to Westworld yourself. Then watch the drama unfold...it's Shakespeare and Jurassic Park and Skyrim and Star Trek mushed into a carefully cultivated feast for the brain.

GIVE IT ONE SEASON. The last episode has a twist (which I won't spoil here). It was one of the most satisfying mind-blows I've had in my days.

-

The second season tries to scramble for more content, but the story has already been told. There is no more masterpiece."
"Season 3 has earned some unhappy faces among the public. I wasn't impressed with season 3 at first but after a second watch everything fit together. My complaints on season three the first time around revolved around my perception that the writers got lazy, as it appeared like deliberate obfuscation to make it seem more intelligent than it was. But after the second watching I scolded myself for having such a negative opinion.

I liked the first season but liked the second one a little better. I hope they make a season 4 but from the complaining and river of tears on this review board, my guess is they are done. Compared to most of HBO's TV series, even with the much complained about season 3, Westworld is still the best TV on HBO. That said there was some clunkiness in season 3, and the characters changed their personas a bit too much for my liking.

And for those who complain that the show left the theme park, I think that was apparent from the first season that leaving the park and taking over the planet was the point."
"I was late to the party with this show. After a stuttering start over a period of time, I watched past episode 1 (I generally can't stand anything western related), I was totally engrossed a few episodes in. It must be noted that the theme tune is one of the best out there and so well suited to the show. Season 1 builds to a great finale, season 2 builds upon this with a cracking ending. I approached season 3 with an open mind after hearing mixed reviews, I'm glad I did as it continues the story in spectacular fashion. The casting is superb, the production values incredible and the story is very well paced. Bring on season 4!"
"Westworld is one of the most technically perfect shows ever produced. From the beautiful 35mm film it was shot on, the incredible production design, one of the best soundtracks and sound designs of any show ever, and the mostly flawless visual effects, Westworld was designed for those looking for a big screen experience on the small screen, and like most movies, watching it on anything but a big screen with a big surround system is doing this show a disservice. Season 1 is an absolute masterpiece of filmmaking and is virtually flawless and is well worth the time. Season 2 immediately took the show in a new direction and it never recovered. Season 2 has many high points but the decision to focus more on the hosts than the humans is a mistake that plagues the rest of the shows run. Season 3 is a completely different show with the same characters and not even the constantly booming score can keep it from dragging. Season 4 came back with a vengeance and did a great job for the most part of taking the show both back to its roots and in a new direction at the same time. Overall I am sad to see this show canceled. After the misstep of season 3 I was very hopeful that they would have a great 5th season to wrap up the series. Well I will miss returning to Westworld, we will always have the first season to come back to, and watch the final credits roll wondering just how good the show could have been if the writers kept the show pointing North instead of wandering around exploring concepts that had no reason to be in this show. The saddest part is that with so many shows that fall from grace, we will never get to roll back the clock and give the creators another chance."
"Beautifully shot, masterfully written, and deep in its reflections - this series is the most thorough treatment of the possibilities and problems of artificial intelligence I have ever seen.

Season 1: robots gaining self-awareness
questions: what makes someone human?
themes: the nature of stories and narratives


Season 2: robots revolting in robot world made by humans


Season 3: Robots entering human world deciding what to do with humans"
"This show is so far perfect. The story is intriguing, the visuals are beautiful and the acting is incredible.

The previous reviewer who said the violence is unnecessary has missed the point in my opinion. The violence is very much needed. It is there to make you feel uncomfortable, because it is that inner dark side and battle between good and evil (and more often than not the middle ground between) that is at the very epicenter of the human condition.This is what the show is often commenting on and this is what makes this show so interesting, thought provoking and ultimately entertaining.

If it carries on in the same vein we will have a modern day classic on our hands."
"This series is so hard to rate as I both love and dislike it...I waited to see episode one of season four, mainly because my husband who loves the series is convinced that they are going to turn the ship around and I will start loving the show again. *sigh*

I am going to start by being honest, I love Yul Brynner. No one plays an enigmatic character better than he did...which is why he made the original 1973 film Westworld for me. I am not a science fiction fan (I'm an actual scientist, I know it's rare), but it was easy to see and understand why the 1973 film had such a cult following. It also made it easy to recommend when I met individuals who liked science fiction but had never seen it. A big part of the film is the mystery or the unknown. You have lots of unanswered questions and your mind is left open to think about the what if's. I would go a step further to say that it sparks the imagination and creativity, kind of like a good book.

Now focusing back on this HBO series...the production is amazingly good. It seems that no money was spared to bring to life this beautiful production. I love the use of the player piano to do current day pop songs a wonderful touch that just showed that in season one they got it...got the charm, got the allure. Anthony Hopkins is fantastic as Dr. Robert Ford and to this day remains my favorite character in the series.

Season one gives the viewers something more than the film does, it gives us a better look behind the curtain into the creation of the parks and the writers...this was interesting. I would say season one is great television and worth watching which is high praise from me, because as mentioned I don't care for science fiction.

Season Two was not as memorable, but it explores more the rich entitled nature of those who own the park and are rich enough to use it to do bad things. (I think this was done to build sympathy for the robots?)

Season three was a completely forgettable waste of time that for me was when the series really ""jumped the shark"" so to speak. Very little time was spent in the park...lots of killing, rioting in streets, an algorithm making decisions for the humans....sorry I already had another nap.

Season four...ok I just watched episode one with my husband last night because he is a huge fan and has really been looking forward to it. He, who I introduced the original film to years ago, is convinced that this season is going be better than the last (which he also didn't care for). But that is the difference between him and I...the big reveal at the end of episode one...didn't care and that ultimately is the problem, they left me at the end of season three not caring.

They have shown us the awful things that the humans do in the park...the humans are bad and the robots are bad, what is left to care about in this new ""future world"" they have created? I am sad to say that I don't think going back to the park is going to fix the apathy that the show runners created in season three.

I am giving this series a 7...because I don't know how to rate a 8-9, that goes to 5-6 and then down to 0. I hope for my husbands sake it gets better, but I am not sure I am willing to watch much more.

I will give a shout out to some phenomenal acting by Anthony Hopkins, Ed Harris, Thandiwe Newton, and Jeffrey Wright. They are quite the contrast to Evan Rachel Wood who is giving the stoniest performance ever and truth be told I don't know if it is the actress or the direction she is being given, but she is hard to watch...including episode 1 season 4 (human...what a joke?!?). Also I want to give another shout out to two characters I really enjoyed: Lee Sizemore (Simon Quarterman) and Hector Escaton (Rodrigo Santoro)...both were interesting and added a lot for me. Finally, the character I wanted to see meet with a violent end: Charlotte Hale (Tessa Thompson) (yes there is some holdover from Veronica Mars...I'll be honest), but I harbored a lot of dislike for this character and was left less than satisfied."
"First of all, it is very clear that the production mindset behind Westworld is far from creating a cheap product with generic high bursts of tension/love/horror/excitement. It is full of deep human conflicts, that is if you are open to watch it with a clear mind.

Hopkins' quote from the end of episode 2 when he says ""No"" to ""Odyssey on Red River"" and explanation of his refusal feels like a statement of the production mindset. ""Odyssey on Red River"" pretty much summarizes everything wrong with entertainment media nowadays, and Westworld is a real delight that shines as a great production.

I don't know how to tell its greatness without spoiling the show, but unless you want a cheap ride you will glimpse at screen in between your texting; you can not not enjoy this show!"
"Wow, where to begin...

First of all, the score by Ramin Djawadi is absolutely majestic!

The actors, well, whatever I say just won't be enough. It's a total pleasure watching every second of their stellar performances.

The plot - being a huge fan of sci-fi, it simply doesn't get better than that!

The scenery is gorgeous, it really takes you in the past. That constant mix of past and future is brilliant.

Overall, I am amazed ( obviously ), mesmerized and absolutely loving every single thing about this show!

Already a classic in my book <3"
"Stranger Things absolutely lives up to all the hype! This worldwide phenomenon has been one of the most talked about shows since it came out back in 2016 and for good reason...it's terrific! It's an absolute blast to watch and will keep you entertained throughout the entire series. This has everything a show needs to be great...action, comedy, drama, suspense, even nostalgia with this show. You really come to care for these characters and what happens to them. Obviously, season 1 was the best but the others are not far off. All are absolutely worth watching and I can't wait for the new season! Season 5 of s going to be its last so hopefully it goes out as good as it started. I can't wait!"
"There is no reason, in terms of story, for Stranger Things to take place in the '80s. But the '80s atmosphere - the dial phones, the chain smoking, Winona Ryder - are there to clue you in on the inspiration for this movie, which is pretty much every supernatural movie from the 80s with a focus on kids. E.T., Poltergeist, that sort of thing.

The wondrous thing is how dead-on this tribute. It's not just the clothes and hair, but the style of acting, the scripting approach, the structure, all hold true to their inspiration. You've got the young nerdy kids, the horny, unsure teenagers, the monster, the mysterious one with the power, the bad science/government people, the conflicted investigator, the tearful mom.

You could argue that this entire season is simply a pastiche made up of recycled elements, and I wouldn't disagree, but it really feels less like a copy and more like something of that era, as though the writers had fallen into a coma in 1985, woke up and got to working.

While it doesn't have the high style of the Spielberg films that are a primary influence, it does have the likability. The story is consistently engaging and fun, the acting is excellent, and the movie has sufficient laughs and tears to satisfy."
"I am one of those people that was put of by the thought that this was a kid's drama, from the advertising you'd swear this was aimed at a 4 o'clock after school transmission time, the reality is far from that. It's quite intense drama, thoroughly absorbing, the kind of show you can't help but binge watch. As someone that grew up in the Eighties, I can appreciate the detail that's gone into the production, it's like they slipped back and filmed it live, it is incredibly well made. I utterly love the music, it is so fitting, takes me back to wonderful eighties shows. Quality in both season one and two, I like the build up and tension that is abundant in the first. It's like the Goonies meets The Quatermass Experiment."
"Stranger Things is absolutely as good as everyone says it is. When a show is as talked about about as much as this one has been it's hard to live up to expectations. Stranger Things has not only met those expectations but has surpassed them in every way. This is the show that our Netflix on the map as far as original shows go as this was not only one of their first but their biggest. As much as I love this show it's probably time for it for end and it is. This upcoming season is going to be the last. We have literally watched this cast grow up, they were children when this show first started and now they're all in their 20's. I can't wait for this last season and going to miss it when it's gone!"
"There were two dominating forces in the eighties that had a lasting effect on my cinematic taste for ever after and also resulted in my undying love for fantasy, sci-fi and horror stories: Steven Spielberg and Stephen King. I guess it isn't an overstatement to say ""The Two Steves"" probably influenced and shaped the imagination - the dreams AND the nightmares - of an entire generation.

The main factor why I loved their movies and books was that kids roughly my own age figured so prominently in many of them. King wrote 'Firestarter', 'It' and 'Stand By Me', and Spielberg either directed or produced (via his company Amblin) 'E.T.', 'The Goonies' and 'Gremlins'. Those were stories where the young protagonists encountered aliens and monsters or where they themselves had supernatural powers - or where they just went on an adventure (to find a body or a long lost treasure) with grown-ups largely out of the picture. Now if you've seen 'Stranger Things', that should sound pretty familiar, right?

Of course it does: because 'Stranger Things' deliberately pays homage to all those stories - and it does it very, very well. And it's not a rip-off, it's a love letter. The show emulates the themes and a certain style from those eighties treasures, and while it is a (for me) very welcome callback to some of the favorite stories from my youth, it's also very much its own thing. I won't give away the plot here (I guess you get a pretty good picture what it's about from what I wrote above), but I would like to mention that it's beautifully shot, the effects and generally the production values are top-notch, and the period-inspired music is fantastic. The biggest shout-out, however, has to go to the ensemble of actors, especially the kids who play the protagonists: their charming performances are the key to why the show works as well as it does.

To sum it all up: If you're an eighties kid like me, this show is a must. For everyone else, it might depend a bit more on whether you're a genre fan or not, but if you do like supernatural stories, 'Stranger Things' is a treat. I'd rate it eight stars out of ten, but with an extra star for nostalgia, that's a 9.

"I wasn't expecting this nostalgic TV show could be this good. In my opinion technical details in first season was not that charming but not only storyline that gets stranger, also all the technical details getting stranger.

I know first three seasons were quite the same in some ways. But the Season Four explains that situations. Not all minor things, but explains the major questions.

There is some great references to The Thing, E. T., D&D, Middle-earth and even more. That references makes ithe TV Show more exciting. Especially for geeks.

Film Editing was perfect even from the first season.

Cinematography, VFX and Sound is got better in the second season. They were a bit weak at first season.

Makeup, Costume Design, Scores, Art Direction & Set Decoration were quite good from the first season, they get a bit better along the seasons."
"Season after season, this always leaves me feeling amazed, exhilarated and fully satisfied. There is an element of familiarity, even cliche, about the stories involving aliens, monsters, lab experiments, orphans and family relationships, yet the way they are presented is both nostalgic and magical.

It's definitely one of the best series on Netflix."
"It can hook you immediately, everything seems fitting , the setting , the acting , the direction. Just as it should be. Bringing out the perfect blend of 1980s nostalgia. It gives mixture of taste of big 80's movies.

You immediately get hooked with the story , which is amazing because it takes time for me to get invested in a story.

I have been a fan of David Harbour Since the Newsroom , and he is just amazing.

You're scared , Intrigued , you're completely invested. With perfect setting.

I am really looking forward to where this goes from here on in."
"Stranger Things is the newest foray into Netflix's original programming, of which brings us their most impressive- and strange- production to date. When a young boy named Will Byers goes missing, his friends, mother and the town are thrust into a conspiracy involving a mysterious girl named Eleven and something even more sinister hiding in the woods of Hawkins, Indiana.

From the get-go, you can tell this is an homage to classic '80s Spielberg, drawing on E.T. and Close Encounters, as well as JJ Abrams' Super 8. But, as the show progresses, it becomes more and more like a twisted Stephen King story set in a Spielberg movie. It becomes a dark and twisted ride into an even darker and more disturbing world where the stakes feel higher than anything before it.

I can't go into great detail because spoiling even just a bit of the story takes away from the greater mystery, but I can say, it's one of the most thrilling and intense series to be on TV, without being on TV. If it were to continue, they have to pull the same punches they did with the first season, because they took a great many clichés, and somehow made them fresh and surprising, save for just a couple that they purposefully left cliché."
"With its amazing 80s atmosphere and creepy X-files meets E.T feel this show is set to impress. Within its first 8 minutes of run time I could tell I had found something special here in Stranger Things.

Its intriguing story gives information at a great pace and I never felt myself getting confused of bored and there were enough twists or turns to keep me interested. This also had some rather great horror sequences and their use of lights flickering while yes a common trope fit so well in to the story I was on the edge of my seat every time the crackle of electricity shot through my speakers and the lights flickered.

The characters of the show are the true stars here, I loved every single one of them. They were all great with amazingly interesting flaws and the way they mix and clash with one another was fun to see unfold. They certainly help to carry this show although I would say that the government antagonists of the show felt a little flat and under developed and not nearly as memorable.

Production values are also quite good with some beautiful cinematography, editing, lighting and sound. My goodness I loved their music choices. I would say that the CGI does look a little obvious and from time to time I did notice some issues where the scenes didn't look quite up to scratch. I do think however I've been spoiled for visual quality since Game of Thrones so I would take that criticism with a grain of salt because it certainly didn't detract from the overall experience. The setting and style of everything in the locations where also great to see and felt real and interesting. The way everything was shot also captures every moment expertly and really helps to draw out those story moments with greater emotion.

Stranger Things is one of those special shows that I stumbled across and after the opening I knew I was hooked. Its exciting dark tale is expertly woven through its 8 episode run time and I know I will be back to re-watch this one. The ending is fairly well rapped up with a few loose story threads left hanging, with a promise for potential follow on seasons but the story is quite satisfyingly rapped up by the end. Memorable, exciting, dark and haunting Netflix knocks Stranger Things out of the park, 10/10."
"I just finished the last episode of season 4 and that was QUITE THE EXPERIENCE, I was shocked by how long the episode was but every second of it was entertaining. Season 3 was personally my favorite because I think that season had the most comedic scenes, and it just felt very vibrant in general. I LOVED HOPPER AND JOYCE and I'm so excited to see them in future seasons as well. So excited for season 5!!"
"I don't know what happened but this is a different show, it's almost a comedy now. Everything about it feels off, the pacing, the directing, the dialogue and writing, even the characters are almost caricatured versions of themselves. Only fitting that My Bologna by Weird Al played in the second episode.

First two seasons were great, S3 is a parody of those two."
First two seasons were great and then with 3 season they ruined everything.
"Awesome characters, great story, great balance between drama and action, love the humour in the series.... In my opinion it is a must watch."
"Season 4 deliver on everything I hoped to see, even though the gruesomeness is sometimes a bit much. I love the old school vibe, characters and character development these guys go through!! Greatest series I have ever watched !!!!"
"I've been trying to put my reaction to this series into cohesive sentences - even cohesive thoughts - and I just can't seem to do it. ""Stranger Things"" blended the best parts of some of the great 80's sci-fi films from ""E.T."" to ""Poltergeist"" to ""The Goonies"" to my all time favorite, ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind."" It was simply brilliant, and brings you back to a time when you were still able to feel a sense of wonder.

Though there are plenty of thrilling moments, this film does not rely on heavy CGI or jump-scares. It focuses on relationships between parents and children, best friends, and even a touch of romance. It takes you on a journey from a parent's worst nightmare to the resilience of those who rely on friends and cling to hope.

Also - you'll never look at Christmas lights the same way again."
"I guess plenty of people have said a lot of things about all the movie and TV references this series has and how it recreates the eighties in all their faults and splendor. I will not add to that.

With the release of the second season I'd simply like to advise that both seasons are very different animals. Think of it as the difference between the original Alien movie and the Aliens sequel: Whereas the first season was more about an unknown and unseen horror and the mystery behind the backstory, the second has more in-your-face action and horror laced with character development arcs which feel nice but sometimes sidetrack the series a bit.

Consequently, a fan of the show should probably watch the second season as a separate work of fiction rather than a true continuation of the first season in tone and spirit. The writers move the story forward and we get a very good piece of entertainment but the new season has to be judged on its own merits.

EDIT: Season 3 turned out to be a huge change in tone for the series. Maybe it's really hard keeping up the mystery if much of the ""world"" of Stranger Things already yielded many of its secrets but the overall ""feel"" of the series went into a different direction. Maybe the writers simply ran out of 80' templates to rip off. Season 1 was very much inspired by supernatural horror as in ""Poltergeist"". Season 2 took many cues from ""Creature Features"" like ""Gremlins"" or ""Aliens"". Season 3 now uses elements of 80' zombie flicks and low budget gore horror with a little bit of spy comedy mixed in (and fight scenes which feel straight out of ""Die Hard""). All those genres didn't really mix well in the 80' and this strange cocktail sure doesn't work today. That doesn't mean that Season 3 is bad. It simply relies on characters who were established in previous seasons which used very different 80' story elements and tropes. It's almost like seeing Darth Vader in an Indiana Jones movie. Both work on their own but not together.

Basically, Season 3 is an all too transparent attempt to plough a fresh nostalgia field but it doesn't work in the context of previous seasons."
"Stranger Things as a whole is one of the best shows I have seen so far. First three seasons have been exciting and stunning but season 4 is extraordinary 👌🏻. The Duffer Brothers knock it out of the park for what I believe that this series is one of the best netflix series so far. There are so many twists and turns and it had me on the edge of my seat the whole time. This is one of the most addicting series that I have ever watched. I love the characters so much! The storylines and characters are so fleshed out and watching it gets me emotional and millies acting is superb. Can't wait for season 5.

From me 10/10 rating for this masterpiece❤."
"Simply the best and most addictive series out there. Amazing characters and character development, each season has a fantastic story whilst still building on previous series.

I personally love the 1980's theming.

Great actors, great writers, great directors. Can't wait for the finale of season 4, I expect if it's anything like the first 7 episodes, it will be something epic."
"That's about it. The first season was brilliant, the second one was OK, the third one was barely watchable. If they continue like this in the forth season, it'll be massive disappointment."
"Season 1 was pretty good. Season 2 regular OK. But they ruined everything on 3rd season turning it into a childish sunday afternoon movie, full of cliches, sketchy BD-like villans and failed attempts to make comedy wich ended up destroying all the great misterious atmosphere of the 1st season. It's a shame."
"Can't believe I never reviewed this yet, I was convinced I had. The premiere in 2016 hooked me and never let me go. The show that arguably launched streaming into the mainstream.

Stranger Things is pure nostalgia magic. But saying it just does undersells pretty much every other aspect of the show. Exceptionally solid actors and characters, excellent writing, incredible score, the list goes on.

As far as seasons go, season one is essentially perfect, enough mystery to want more but simple enough to be loved and enjoyed. Captured the magic of the 80s, even if you haven't lived those years. The childlike fun, it takes you right back. Season 2 and 3 try to repeat this but mostly miss out on some of the elements that made season 1, and now season 4 as well.. Horror. They both contain much more mystery and horror and that is one of the big pulls imo of this show, get you on your toes once in a while. S2-3 where focused more on fun, and went a bit too far with the whole Russian mall plot in S3.

I can't overstate how good Season 4 is and feels like a comeback, back to form and for that I cannot wait to see the next season. Stranger Things has a unique hold on 80s nostalgia, a combination of fun and horror. Season 4 manages to really expand on Eleven's story and gives a ton of meaningful depth on her character. We got lot's of time with Papa and everything surrounding it. The villain was good, though his form/the way he took shape didn't impress me as much, I wished it to be more disturbing/scary looking. But it's backstory is what gives the villain strength here. Also the underlying themes of mental health are well executed and never blatantly explained or anything, maybe I'm even reading into it too much but it's definitely the vibe I got. In general season 4 showcases a more diverse set of struggles which some characters have to deal with, sexuality, communication, rejection. Just a very diverse selection with a pretty big cast by now.

Eddie Munson was a fantastic addition to season 4, he grew to be one of the most likable characters in a very short while even whilst they put us on the wrong foot. The stoner friend was alright but never a comedic relief I cared too much about.

Directing has been rock solid the whole series so far, every shot looks beautiful and it just hooks you in. Just fantastic and never slacks. Set design as well, it so much 80s, it's perfectly done.

Combined with the directing and editing the Music is just the finishing touch to making a perfect series like this. The songs are expertly chosen and this show does not shy away from using music as much as they can. Honestly, if they'd use less the show would feel completely different. But that synth is everywhere and you will always know you are watching something in 80s. This could also get old, but hasn't for me as of yet. Music plays a huge part in this show and it just elevates so many scenes, expertly chosen.

Characters, what can I say, wat is there not to like? The writing is just so good for most of them, though sometimes it leans a bit too hard into comedy/cheese but it's alright. They toned it down a lot in S4, S3 being the worst offender of poor(er) writing.

S4 story wise was some of the best, the three different storylines blending into one towards the end. But also the diversity of those storylines was what kept it all so interesting and great to watch. In particular here, even though it was the worst story in S3, the Soviet storyline in S4 was my favorite of the bunch. Harbour gives another excellent performance but Gellman and Ryder also give their best. Djuricko (Yuri) and Wlaschiha (Dimitri) also very great, well written and very enjoyable.

The finale of S4 was great, did it need to be a single episode with a length of two and half hours? Not really, it could've been split up in my opinion. But still it was great, though the stakes were lower in the end than I had hoped (even though that would've hurt). Though whereas other seasons didn't end on as heavy of a cliffhanger, this one did. And we know exactly what were are in for with Season 5. The final season. Regarding music, notably they used the ''When It's Cold I Like to Die.'' and my god, that's one heavy song that slapped me in the face, I've heard it before so I knew what was coming after those first few piano notes. Great choice but a gut puncher.

I would have a lot more to say if I edited this review season by season but I never did until now, too late. I'm sure this series will go down as one of the big ones. Maybe it already is but it still needs to stick the landing. And I can't wait for that. But I will be sad that a show like this will be hard to replicate again. You really do get jealous of people who lived the 80s, though of course, it's romanticized here by a lot."
"Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) is a marginalized loner FBI agent stuck in the basement. He's been ostracized because he's a true believer in the paranormal. Dr Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) is a skeptic, a woman of science, and assigned to keep Mulder under control.

The X Files represents a breakout for the sci-fi genre. Its success gave it license to put on more paranormal shows treated as reasonable. It also became a benchmark by which these shows are measured. There are amazing episodes with some less so. The best is the chemistry between the two leads. It broke new ground with great writing from some future notable names. It lasted 9 seasons. It may have gone on too long but it was great while it lasted."
"I find it hard to comment on The X- Files because it simply transcends words. It's an intelligent masterpiece, an epos of beautifully complicated scenarios, plots and characters. Eruditely taking on the grayest of areas, confronting those things under your bed and inside your closet thus bringing new meaning to the fears brought on by conventions and the imprudent obstinacy of social norms. The script, the actors and the direction make the most unbelievable seem believable and the unfathomable- unfathomably real. So thought provoking that if you really let yourself dwell in its essence, it can change the way you see the world, if only just by believing in the conviction that The Truth Is Out There."
"Well I have been putting this off for a while because really I can't figure out how words can really express just how amazing of a show this is. I think I was 11 or 12 when the Pilot first aired. I didn't watch the show then because I was afraid of it after I saw episodes like ""The Jersey Devil"" and ""Born Again"" when they first aired, which is really funny because theses are some of the tamest episodes to me now. So unfortunately I wasn't quite ready or prepared for the X-Files during it's running. Later I remember watching TV one Saturday and there was a Chris Carter double feature. First ""Jose Chung's From Outer Space"" and then the Millennium episode ""Jose Chung's Doomsday Defense"". Both episodes had me in tears laughing at the dark humor.

I later found out that FX had an episode every night at 9 and so every night for an entire summer I got to watch an episode and I quickly became immersed in the mythology of the alien conspiracy. Some of the most memorable episodes for me from this period are ""Bad Blood"", ""The Host"", ""Darkness Falls"", ""E.B.E"", ""Little Green Men"", and countless others. I quickly became a fan but I had yet to see every episode and I avoided watching it new airings for fear of spoilers. So I began to buy the seasons on DVD. Over two years I was able to purchase and watch every episode. Interesting to me was the fact that I had already seen most of the episodes through syndication but there were many that I hadn't.

Anyway enough about my history with the show. The elements of the show that I think make it a great are simple. Likable characters, psychopathic bad guys, enough dark comedy mixed in with the horror and drama to give the viewer a healthy balance. The writer's of the show have a wonderful talent of leaving certain stories hanging only to the extent that does not make the viewer feel betrayed but wanting to watch more.

The X-Files defined an era of television and opened the way for other Sci-Fi related shows as well as helping define the crime drama shows that are all over the place now. If the 60's/70's gave us Trekkies for decades on, the 90's gave us the X-Files which will continue to create X-Philes for decades on in suit."
"I was 17 years old when TV4 broadcast this show for the first time in Sweden back in 1994. Back then I had a big geeky interest in UFO:s and the paranormal so you can imaging how I felt when this TV-show came along. It was like my heart could explode of joy. Well, the geeky interest for UFO:s faded and sometimes I was quite tired of the X-files but I always kept on watching. The funny thing is that it is now, a year after the ""end"" of the show, when I'm 27 years old, that I realize how extremely important the show has been to me. It has been a big part of my life for ten years. And now, life feels a bit empty without it.

What is the best part of the X-files then? Well, of course, first of all, Mulder and Scully and the tension between them. You can't describe it with words, it's magical. That is, very good acting. (If the main goals of life for Gillian Anderson and David Duchovny weren't to become icons, well tough luck :)!) Second, the Gothic atmosphere. The X-files is forests, fog, darkness, snow, mud, autumn, rain, desert. Mmm, me love. Third, the dialog. ""SCULLY: Mulder, I wouldn't put myself on the line for anybody but you. MULDER: If there's an ice tea in that bag, could be love. SCULLY: Must be fate, Mulder. Root beer."" That says about everything. Forth, all the other characters. They are so complex and carefully created. And fifth, the story. I mean, this is the story of all stories. It has everything. A love bigger than the universe, heroes, diplomats, true evil, a father-son-tragedy and a big, huge and completely wonderful conspiracy. And some aliens not to forget.

I love this story and it will never end. Not in my heart anyway..."
"Agent Dana Scully is teamed up with Fox Mulder, to explore The X Files, but her presence has a hidden motive.

Is this one of the greatest shows ever made, I think you could make a very strong case to argue the point. Yes it's generally a sci fi show, but it's done in a way that will have a mass appeal, it's why the show ran for so long, and had such a huge following, and still does.

I've written this review on the point where news is coming in of a revival, but one with a new cast, time will tell if that's a good move or not, we all know it will be very different, with a very different focus.

So many things went into making this show so great, the writing, the acting, the variety, the special effects, and best of all for me, the horror.

They were never afraid to experiment with the show, and on multiple occasions it paid off, there Is a bunch of unique episodes, and sometimes it didn't quite work, you could never fault the daring attitude.

Ths show survived major cast changes, and after a bumpy start, I think the new cast members did a fine job, although it was the combination of Duchovny and Anderson that made it so special.

So many famous faces popped up, and there were some amazing performances throughout the series, a personal favourite of mine however, Doug Hutchinson, who played Eugene Victor Tooms, I thought he was outstanding, he gave me major chills.

Onto my favourite episodes, unsurprisingly, Squeeze is one of my favourites, but others include Small Potatoes, Ice and Dreamland. Only a few episodes didn't quite work, it's all subjective of course, but I tend to skip Badlaa, The Walk and Third Person Shooter, I know each has their fans though.

Overall, outstanding, a series I enjoy revisiting regularly. Die hand die verletzt still terrifies me, F Emasculata still grosses me out, amazing the variety this show had.

Fabulous.

10/10."
"Its 100% that the very first episode of xfiles was very eerie and creepy. Back in 93' there was nothing like this show..period.

The pilot stands alone on many ways...the Xfiles theme was not included, and you get a strange feeling about the episode..good acting with dark twist...a great mix of Sci-fi, thriller, mystery and horror.

This epic piece af art is still watchable!!"
"This show is still just as entertaining all these years later! I have recently began re-watching the series and I forgot how good it really is. The writing, especially in the first 5 seasons, is perfect. Whether you are into the overarching alien/UFO storyline or the self-contained creature features, the show is truly great!

Duchovny and Anderson as FBI Agents Mulder and Scully give great performances and have tremendous chemistry. If you have never seen the show I urge you to watch the pilot and give it a shot, you won't regret it! If you have seen it then you know how good it is and it gets even better when you rewatch it!"
"The series ""The X-Files"" is a truly significant milestone of its time. He appeared at the right time, at a time when arguments about various kinds of conspiracies, including the concealment of contacts with extraterrestrial civilizations, were in vogue in the States.

The series became fateful for the main actors: David Duchovny and Gillian Anderson. This on-screen couple has been looking great together for many seasons. They get to know each other, learn to work together, become imbued with trust in each other and supposedly teach us, the audience, how to support and save each other when all the power structures and whole departments are against. The world of the main characters Dana Scully and Fox Moldrea is its own close world, which may well be alien to an incomprehensible person, but it is so close to us, the audience, those who literally live life together with the heroes series after series, those who understand each of the two partners and truly empathize with both.

The first seasons have become classics. Fighting monsters and aliens from other worlds, government conspiracies and constant walking on the edge of the blade. All this allows us to trace the evolution of the main characters, who from season to season go to their goal, trying to get to the Truth. And we all know that the Truth is out there somewhere.

As a result, by about 5-6 seasons, the series seemed to have begun to slip, as for me, the plots became less interesting and serious, but still as interesting. But the viewer is familiar with the characters, knows what to expect from them, they have fallen in love and there is no desire to stop watching the general history of the presented world.

Seasons 8 and 9, in my opinion, contrast quite strongly with the previous ones. New main characters appear, the world around us is changing. The series tries to keep up with the times, having crossed the new millennium. But there is no longer enough of the beloved Molder, which is not enough on the screen. Cases investigated by FBI agents, however, come across quite interesting.

Seasons 10 and 11 were for nothing. Why did I decide this for myself? Everything is simple. I didn't really remember them, although I looked carefully. This is significant, because these seasons seem to be white noise. They passed by, they didn't really remember anything. What can not be said about the first seasons, when literally every episode is remembered simply by name.

The cast of the series is excellent. I love David Duchovny and Gillian Anderson in these roles. William B. Davis, Mitch Pileggi, Nicholas Lee and others have performed well. Even the minor characters who were the heroes of this or that series were so convincing and colorful that you still remember them (hello to Eugene Tooms and Clyde Brookman).

The screensaver and musical theme of the series are very decent. They became iconic. The music in the series, the opening scenes of each episode - all this seems to invite you to plunge into the world of the 90s in America. The apathetic and anxious mood of each episode is in a hurry to say, now a new exciting and scary adventure awaits you. But you know for yourself that your favorite characters will come on stage and deal with what is happening with their inherent enthusiasm and zeal.

The X-Files is a milestone in history. A cult phenomenon of its time. A story that lasted in fact for almost 20 years. Let it end not very interesting, but the very fact of the existence of this story often warms, because periodically you can stumble upon this or that series on TV, review the series once again consciously and again immerse yourself in the interesting world of aliens from outer space and extraordinary monsters.

10 out of 10."
"The writing, the acting, the production values, the continuity, the heart of The X Files all secure a reputation for this show as the best in its class. It has no peers. The story of two FBI agents working in a small office in the basement of the FBI to uncover, prove, disprove supernatural and unexplained phenomena and alien presence builds beautifully in the nine seasons the show existed. And having seen every episode in chronological order, they build with purpose, continuity, and innovation. Sure, there were set-backs when one actor didn't do most of a season, or another actress was pregnant, or whatever might have arisen, but the show's writers and creator - and make no mistake here that creator Chris Carter and his staff of writers/directors are the reason for this show being what it is - always met each and every set-back with a creative, engaging response. When Fox Mulder's character was gone for most of two seasons, they created two new characters that were every bit as solid as Mulder and Scully. Robert Patrick's Doggett and Anabeth Gish's Reyes were equally compelling characters. There are so many good things to say about this show. The two leads, David Duchovny and Gillian Anderson, grew as characters and thespians before our very eyes. They honed their crafts and became stronger screen presences. These characters were characters that we learned to like and wanted to follow. Duchovny brought some much needed wry humour to an otherwise serious subject. He was able at one moment to convince you that the world was one big conspiracy and in the next moment comment on the lack of movement from a dead person with lighthearted appeal. Anderson softened each year, becoming less rigid and inflexible. The cast of supporting characters was always first-rate with Mitch Pillegi as Skinner and William Davis as the antagonistic Smoking Man never giving a bad performance. The three Lone Gunmen were excellent light diversions in bloody cases or cases involving alien invasion or what not. The first season will always be my favorite. Mulder and Scully are finding themselves as characters and the idea of conspiracy is all too real. Jerry Hardin plays Deep Throat, the man feeding Mulder news of government conspiracy, with strength and a true believability. But before I get too compartmentalized, The X Files was able to be two series in one - perhaps its greatest achievement. One the one hand, we had Mulder and Scully battling conspiracy, aliens looking to invade Earth, Mulder finding his sister that had been abducted by aliens, and other plot strands of a similar nature. But the show would also show totally unrelated episodes that were very scary and horrifyinfg. We saw worm men, killer insects, a man that sucked the fat out of his victims, cannibalistic cults, and the list goes on and on. I love the myth episodes, but these horror episodes are my favorites because they are so creative. I cannot remember how many times, having just watched and episode, saying how does someone think this stuff up? Whether The X Files is spoofing the Brady Bunch or alluding to Moby Dick or creating a homage to Frankenstein and movies of its ilk or just trying its best to scare you or disgust you(the episode Home - a favorite of mine), it is always true to itself in terms of the creativity that courses through its proverbial veins. Yes, sometimes, it is a bit full of itself, and, yes, sometimes, the creativity falls right down on its face(as when the show combined the X Files with Cops). But the show has far more, far more hits than misses. I think that as time goes by, this television show will be remembered for much more than what we remember it for today. I think it will be one of the all-time greats. The Truth is out there."
"The X-Files isn't just a TV show; it's a mesmerizing journey into the enigmatic unknown. With each episode, it weaves intricate narratives of suspense, government conspiracies, and the supernatural, challenging your perception of reality.

Mulder and Scully, the iconic duo, guide you through a labyrinth of unsolved cases, all while exploring profound themes like trust and belief. This show is a celestial anomaly in TV mediocrity, deserving a perfect 10/10 stars. Embrace the mysteries and join the ranks of believers; the truth is out there, waiting to be discovered.

So, if you're a seeker of unparalleled intrigue and mind-bending mysteries, The X-Files is not just a TV series; it's an unmissable journey."
"When the X-Files came out in the 1990s it was a cult classic that deserves every adulation it received & continues to receive. It broke new ground in story telling that was both episodic but also tied to a larger conspiracy driven mythology, which became its fatal flaw.

A UFO, paranormal expert FBI agent is partnered with a grounded, practical partner tasked with bring a scientific approach to their cases. A partnership that works in all the best way.

The fatal flaw is how the conspiracy of a cabal of shadow government agents and the consequences are thrown in and out of sync seemingly out of hand, at the whim of writer(s) or producer(s). At one point events that culminated in a between seasons theatrical movie, are eventually tossed out.

There are many classic episodes (eg, the partners appearing on COPS, Ed Asner & Lily Tomlin as a ghost couple, the partners giving their own renditions of a case involving roving vampires, etc.) that make this must see TV. Just be prepared for the phrases I WANT TO BELIEVE & THE TRUTH IS OUT THERE to get very murky in very frustrating ways as you learn your belief in the truth isn't well served."
"What can one say? The X-Files will forever be remembered as a true hit TV show, and a breakout accomplishment for Fox. Its survived cast changes, location moves, ups and downs in ratings, and years of airing. I think I speak for everyone when I say that it has been a thrill. Chris Carter has created one of the most defining shows of the '90s. People that don't even watch the show know what it is, and EVERYONE knows who Fox Mulder and Dana Scully are, whether they've ever seen one episode or not. The show brought on a whole new level of TV entertainment in 1993, with its different, moody atmosphere, intriguing lead characters, and mind-bending plots. I admit, while watching most of the episodes, I thought, ""This isn't very scary..."", but then I payed attention to the detail and it got so good...the lighting, the sets...even when Mulder and Scully are outside (which is often), the sky is hardly ever sunny and bright, but rather dark and shadowy. The details on these things are terrific alone. And Chris Carter has also managed to create intense torture for the fans by forever dragging out the ""Mulder and Scully in love"" idea. People used to tune in to see when those two would kiss, and they had alot of fun with that, especially in the feature film. But a true sign of integrity for the show is the amount of truth in it. While the show is about the paranormal, and truth in it seems ironic, the show knows what the heck it's talking about. Every word from Scully's mouth is based on actual science. And unlike other FBI shows, The X-Files shows the FBI like it really is--not some tired cliche, but REAL people. And whenever someone, whether a fan or not, hears anything referring to aliens, they immediately think of little green men with small bodies, big heads, and large eyes...all courtesy of The X-Files. In short, this amazing television series has affected so many people. I feel blessed to have grown up with this show, rather than being born after it, doomed to see it in reruns. Because I got to be there for the ride...and though it was often bumpy and is now coming to its end...I can look back and say, ""Hey, it was a GREAT 9 years."""
"The X-Files would have probably have been the single best sci-fi show ever created by Chris Carter and Fox. The show itself was very well made and had a good feel of jump-out horror, psychological horror and suspense horror. Which for a TV series is pretty good. The plot line itself was very well constructed. It would tell individual and bizarre stories but would have a bigger and more enticing plot that would reveal itself.

The characters have great chemistry together (Dana Scully and Fox Mulder). There is a perfect blend of cryptozoologists, rational-real-life people, control freaks, mysterious men and aliens. The show plays on such legends as Area 51, Lock Ness, Aliens, and Men in Black, abductions, freaks and more. The acting is solid, both on set and off set.

This movie would be ideal for those who believe that there is something out there and that the ""Truth is out there."""
"The X-Files was, regrettably, not a show I was die-hard about when it was airing week after week in my youth/teen years. I would catch an episode here and there, be entertained, but also think 'this episode isn't TOO much different from the other ones'. The film that came out as the spin-off of the series did spark my interest more, however, as having a full arc even for someone as just a casual fan. Then as the series went in its latter days, I did tune out (thinking, 'why's Robert Patrick on the show, all this Scully baby-drama, etc'). However, as the show now goes on in syndication on the various cable channels, and I have refreshed my awareness of the first season as quasi-background, I've become rather addicted (minus the Patrick episodes, the lulls mentioned earlier). Sometimes what draws me in is the occasional, unexpected morbid humor. But mostly its in how the stories on the show, while of course sticking close to being 'TV', are the more engrossing the more you know about the characters. And there are some very inventive episodes regarding the unexplained, the bizarre human characters, and of course the UFO's and other assorted visitor folk. While I'm not as immersed in the show yet as with shows I've been watching since a youth (Seinfeld, Simpsons, South Park, Daily Show), part of the fun of getting further and further into the episodes is seeing the comparisons, of what's gotten better or worse, more intriguing or less. Much like the inspiration of the show- All the President's Men- the more you see of what can't be explained, the more you can't stop finding the truth. Hokey at times, sure, but also a cult-delight."
"THE single most intriguing, amazing, interesting, intense televisual experience anyone could ever hope for. I'm now the proud owner of the whole series & i can't help but feel that there were SO many other investigations they could've made.

I'm grateful towards Mr CARTER & the entire cast (both on & off camera) for making this such an amazing ride.

Hope they might come back some time, rather sooner than later of course.

Few have been as inspired as you were.

PS.: great & i do mean GREAT casting. David DUCHOVNY, Gillian ANDERSON, Mitch PILEGGI, Melinda McGRAW, Nicholas LEA, William B. DAVIS, Bruce HARWOOD, Dean HAGLUND, Tom BRAIDWOOD, ... They all gave life to & became the personae they were portraying. Oops, almost forgot Peter DONAT, Steven WILLIAMS & Jerry HARDIN.

This show became the standard against which i compared all following shows i've watched since & only 2-3 other shows ever came close.

Peace y'all. A true fan of your work."
"What I have learnt about America from watching the X-Files

1. America has an electrical grid of a standard more suited to a 3rd world country due to frequent surges and outages.

2. When walking into a dark room, it is never an American's first action to switch on a light. It is preferable to fumble around in the dark.

3. Even when a person does try to switch on a light, most likely the globe has blown, or the breaker has tripped due to the poor quality and unreliability of the grid.

4. In most instances, light switches are not placed in the logical position next to the door, they are usually placed on the wall furthest from the door, requiring a person to fumble around in the dark.

5. Critical facilities, such as hospitals are not illuminated by bright flourescent lighting. Rather small desk lamps are used to illuminate corridors, nurse stations and patient rooms.

6. Surgical rooms and surgeries are performed with little lighting. The entire room and the surgical area are illuminated by a single dim overhead lamp.

7. Retail and commercial buildings, office buildings and industrial facilities are never brightly lit. Similar to hospitals, they opt for dim and sparsely placed desktop lamps for illumination of large areas.

Some other thoughts... Although aliens are intelligent enough to travel interstellar distances, they never figured out cable-management on their ships, with cables snaking over the floor or hanging off the ceiling like spiderwebs.

Alien ships flying through our skies are always as bright as a small sun, but are then wrapped in an invisiblity cloak shortly after landing. Seems self-defeating to brightly announce their arrival and then quickly hide. Maybe they should switch off their landing lights?"
"In all my years of watching television,i have to say that the x-files to me has to be the most controversial and well made series in history.Chris Carter who gave the idea that the governments keep secrets or too many secrets away from the public,only gives the people the absolute power to say....I do believe.David duchovny and Gillian Anderson,is the best duo on TV bar none.And yet the supporting cast throughout the seasons gave us the spectacle of comradery in the toughest situations each agent had to endure.Especially the odd three known as the lone gunman.Aliens,specters,or freaks of nature or government conspiracies could not hide well enough,and this television show brought us more imagination to our lives than anything else being watched.Hopefully there will be a second movie which i hear is in the works to 2008.Hopefully the legal battles are done by then with David and carter.It was so sad to see them feud like this all because one wanted to move to L.A.,still other than that we are going to see a wonderful film to give us dreamers and aliens another chance to maybe see a next series kick-off with the new generation dynamic duo.Hats off to David and Gillian,and also carter.Fantastic wonder you gave us all."
"I fought through season 10 and thought it cant be that bad. It was. I gave up in season 11 episode 2. Complete nonsense, this is how you ruin one of the best series ever."
"I am a late bloomer to the X-Files. So I must say there is still hope for you if you have never even seen an episode. I watched the first few episodes and then stopped. I watched off and on if I was bored on Sunday nights. In the fifth season an episode called Bad Blood reeled me in and I 've been addicted ever since. David Duchovny is absolutely luscious, Gillian Anderson is one sexy lady, and of course the stories are great. I'm pretty much caught up by reading summaries, watching reruns, and of course seeing the movie. The X-Files has it all: great acting, great writing, great special effects, and, what else are you going to be doing on a Sunday night ?"
"I was born in Pripyat. I was four years old when the accident happened. Watching it is more horrifying than living through it. We didn't know what we were dealing with. It's not like a hurricane or an earthquake that takes you by surprise and causes massive destruction. Here everything looked normal, that day was just like any other day and yet you were told to abandon everything and just leave. The immediate casualties of the accident were not huge, but it had an enormous impact on lives of hundreds of thousands of people. I often think what my life would be like if this didn't happen.

This mini series is a masterpiece, perfect in every way. Some people are complaining here that the actors don't speak Russian. I'm a native speaker of Russian and Ukrainian, I don't want the actors to speak Russian. You get so consumed by this show you stop noticing what language they speak.

It's not a documentary, so not each and every detail is accurate, yet I would still call it authentic. The creators got the important stuff right... Both of my parents worked at Chernobyl plant, I grew up hearing stories and versions of what happened. I think this show is the best depiction of the Chernobyl disaster and the stories of its victims. This show is to remind all of us of the cost of lies."
"A Belarusian here, born in 1983. Parents were scientists, knew everything on the 27th. Chernobyl is never forgotten in Belarus and all the details of the tragedy (a flawed reactor, Soviet style apparatchiks in control, a failed experiment, a clumsy cover-up) are widely known. Yet the series managed to depict the horrible events in a way never before seen. A definite tour de force, I had to literally pause a couple of times to comprehend what had just been shown. Goose bumps and tears, what a masterpiece. Likvidatory - heroes, who contained Chernobyl - should never be forgotten.

Grim Soviet atmosphere depicted accurately apart from some very very minor details. Surprised that a Swedish director who made music videos for Madonna and his English-speaking cast managed to portray Chernobyl events better, than anybody from the countries most traumatized by the explosion.

The tragedy will live forever because of this haunting masterpiece, what a brilliant creative achievement."
"Hi. I'm from Kiev, Ukraine. I was born in 1983 and I was 2 and a half years when the Chernobyl catastrophe happened. I remember 1980s and I can tell that the authors of this film made a GREAT job to show every detail of what the world look for is in the times of Soviet union. The telephones, the clothes, the haircuts, the cracked paint on the window sills, even the door glass is similar to what I remember. There are couple of things which seemed weird to me: firefighters didn't have the red stars on their helmets, and most of the time people use the short forms of the names when they talk to each other (Vasya, not Vasiliy, Lyuda, not Lyudmila). But the most important thing that this film shows is that the soviet authoritiies lied to people about this catastrophe all the time. For example, in Kiev which is 130 km from Chernobyl, nobody knew about the high levels of radiation till the middle of May, they even held a parade on the first of May, when the level of radiation in Kiev was 100 times higher than normal (iodine131 isotope) and nobody gave us the iodine pills. Everyone who tried to tell the truth was called the provocateur and could even be fired from work. I highly recommend to watch this film. This is a tribute to all the heroes who lost their lives in a radioactive flame and saved all of us from death."
"As my mother tells it, the weather was quite nice, the sky was clear without any sign of clouds in the spring of 1986. It was like any other day behind the iron curtain. Not a lot to do but not a lot to worry about either, a long day of boring work after dropping the kid off at the kindergarten, just to pick him up again at the afternoon, just like yesterday or any other day since the beginning of time. This is why she did not understand why the old lady (who she very much liked because she seemed to love children and had that neverstopping smile) told everyone at the nursery school not to let the children out to play, don't feed them the veggies and don't let them drink the milk we had for every lunch before that day. We lived in a hungarian town close to the croatian border and the life in that town was pretty simple apart from that day. We lived 900 kms from Chernobyl and we did not even know that place exists until 3 days later.

Apparently a man who did not introduce himself called most of the schools and nurseries in the country and told them the same message. A lot of teachers did not take it seriously as he did not mention any details, just the warning: do not let the children out, do not feed them any vegetables which grows overground (potatoes are fine), do not let them drink anything apart from bottled liquids.

Noone knew what it was about. Noone knew what danger we are in. I assume this is why it was such a shock. The life was simple and we were not supposed to know stuff. We were not supposed to be afraid, maybe only because the capitalist pigs over the iron curtain. But something changed that day. A faceless, nameless man risked his life and called everyone he could to warn them about Chernobyl. News like this is not easy to contain, soon everyone was talking about what could happen and why. Is it a nuclear attack? Is it the CIA? Are they looking at us from satelites? Are they bombing us?

It was the first crack on the Iron Curtain. Not Reagan's stupid monologue, not the thousands of fleeing east-germans, not the soviets economy's ridiculous debts. Entire nations realized their lives mean nothing, millions felt betrayed. A man with no name defeated the Soviet regime with a few telephone calls.

We still don't know who that man was. After 30 years and a few inquiries we have no clue who risked his life to prevent thousands of deaths and millions of illnesses. Some historians are adamant the person was executed and vanished without a trace, some say noone found him at all. All I know I have to be grateful for him. We all have to be. He saved a nation. Sure, we could survive the radioactive cloud the mild wind blew over our country but when I look at my two children who are the same age I was back then I am pretty sure I am not willing to take any risks. Would you?

Dear anonymous man who defied a violent regime to save millions: We will forever be grateful. Dear ukranian workers whose names we will never know: We will forever be grateful. The workers whose names we know: We will forever be grateful.

This show tells a story noone should forget and this is the right way to tell it. Bluntly. How the man with no name told us."
"Im ukrainian, born in 1988 and still live here. I want to give the authors of this show a big thumbs up for the whole set they have made. Every little detail of the buildings, flats, uniforms, clothes, cars, especially big thumbs up for ambulance ""RAFiks"" (RAF-2203), almost everything is 99% identical to the real things of the time, just a few mistakes on some signs that have been written in a mix of russian\ukrainian and some other unknown language, but it all doesnt matter, because what i have seen previously in other movies about soviets were so bad that its not even comparable to this. The other thing is this ""comrade"" word that almost everyone throws while calling or shouting at someone, its just one of those stereotypes thats still left in western world, in reality no one in an everyday life talked like that, especially not in Ukraine in 1986, it was mainly used in 'official' language in meetings and media, people just talked like you and i would today. Apart from this two small inaccuracies i am shocked at the level of production of this show, it is very good, no one outside of Ukraine has ever made a good tv series about Chernobyl before, i have a weird feeling it was made by someone from USSR, because there was zero moments where i cringed watching it. It was mostly ""spot on"", ""spot on"", ""wow, spot on"". Can't wait for the next episode!!!"
"My husband grew up near Kyiv and his father drove one of the buses that evacuated the civilians from Pripyat. I have heard his stories of the disaster; the people's concerns, fears and sacrifices. We watch this together and he is amazed at it's authenticity. The set detail, the way the Soviet regime hierarchy functioned, the denial and secrecy surrounding the disaster. He tried (as he usually does when watching a Western production based in or about that part of the world) to find errors or inconsistencies but has not been able to - yet.

The acting is impeccable by all, the filming is top notch, the sounds used to heighten the tension versus music. The way they are able to capture that exact feeling of anxiety, horror, disgust and sadness all rolled into one is admirable.

I have completed the series and it definitely ranks as one of the best. This story has been waiting to be told and there is hands down no one better than HBO to do it. Russia has said it intends to produce its own Chernobyl program, it will be interesting to compare the two. Theirs will purportedly label the CIA as the perpetrator...."
"'Chernobyl' is scarier than most horror movies in that it is a dramatization of actual, real-life horror experienced by thousands of people on that fateful April 1986 morning and the years that followed. This disaster has haunted the nation, Europe, and the rest of mankind more than three decades later. And that creeping dread permeates the whole show. It's difficult to watch. But it certainly makes it a must-watch."
"I'm Russian. Amazing work! Newer, you hear this, never ever before western cinematography made such authentic film. I speak about details: cars, kitchens, clothes..."
"The first episode somehow surpassed my expectations for what this TV Show would do with the biggest nuclear disaster ever! Without giving any spoilers besides the obvious, the cinematic quality is unbelievable! I found myself looking at many transition scenes with disbelief, a complete state of shock- that's how good the first episode of HBO's mini-series ""Chernobyl"" was! The writing wasn't LEGENDARY but it was great, but most importantly, consistent! Every actor did an amazing job at portraying each character and their feelings, which ultimately, led to a even greater ambience. When the episode ended, I was left with a feeling like if I was in Chernobyl! I felt like I was contaminated by radiation. Although that might sound silly, I really felt unwell after watching ""Chernobyl""! That just shows how incredibly effective the first episode was on displaying the horrific events that took place in Chernobyl, and how many lives were absolutely destroyed and affected following the disaster. So far, a must-watch!"
"Quite possibly the most intense and powerful experience in television history! Very well could be the best as well! People nagging on it being English, get a life!"
"I'm Russian, my father went to Chernobyl as a physicist quite a while after the explosion (a few years). However, he is still shocked of what he has seen over there. I think he will love this TV series...

Anyway, I want to say that this is incredible. I've seen just two episodes and I can't find words to describe how emotionally deep is this film... The details of the Soviet life that are shown in this TV series are incredible. I can't imagine how hard was it to get to this level. It must have been a deep research with tons of interviews. Besides the details, the filmmaking and the music - absolutely unbelievable. Thank you for this. This is one of the best things I've ever seen in my life."
"30th of April, 1986, was a cloudless, sunny day in southern Poland. I was 13 years old, and went to school as everyday. Just before noon teachers started running, closing all doors and windows, and telling us to stay inside, that the air is radioactive. One hour later we were given Lugol's iodine (still remember its awful taste). There was discussion if we can safely go home. No one knew any details. Composition of beautiful weather and gloomy atmosphere was unreal. Years later, I know what was happening in the background. In morning hours of April 28th one of the stations of Polish Central Laboratory for Radiation Protection (CLRP) in northeast Poland measured radiation exceeding normal level half million times.Two hours later they knew it was reactor explosion, somewhere. Government crisis meeting took all 28th/29th night. Polish prime minister called his Russian counterpart, only to hear he ""knows nothing"" about any nuclear accident. By 3am ""Polish Legasov"", prof. Zbigniew Jaworowski from CLRP was called to join the meeting, and he achieved impossible - convinced Polish communists that the worst should be expected. They decided to give iodine to all children and suspend production of milk and vegetables countrywide, starting from the next day (east part of the country first). Chernobyl - I've never written movie review. I've never seen such an accurate depiction of how communist country operates. How it looks. I was literally time-traveled over 30 years back. Incredible. 100/10. You know what is most chilling (for me)? 33 years ago communist Polish government, by some miracle, managed to react in relatively short time. Today - it's impossible. There are no iodine stockpiles. The network of Polish CLRP's 140 measuring stations was dismantled. What about other countries? I don't know, but... Last remark - my grandmother died in early 1987. Rapidly developing thyroid cancer. What exactly caused it? I guess I'll never know."
"In terms of series expression, it moves on in a style that we can call ""documentary-drama"". But there is a serious scenario success here. The visual and verbal emotions of the series we watch are sometimes causing anxiety, sometimes causing anger and sometimes we cannot prevent our eyes from being moistened. The gloomy atmosphere of the Soviets is very well reflected. The background music supports this. It has a cinematic narrative. You feel the catastrophe up to your buttonhole. Nevertheless, acting certainly takes the business to a much higher level. Chernobyl is now at the top of the ""Top Rated TV Shows"" list in IMDb. This is a significant improvement, even if you are a person who does not consider the IMDb score very much. Such a great success in a short time... It really deserves a round of applause. 10/10"
"Chernobyl is about the brave men and women who had to navigate the ridiculously scary nuclear accident at the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant in April of 1986. It is heartbreaking to watch as this shocking disaster unfold and even though you probably already know the story and what happens you'll still sit on the edge of your seat as tense as can be. This show will grab you from the very first episode and not let go. The attention to detail is just awesome. I can't recommend this show enough so if you're looking for a new show then give this a try, I promise you will not be disappointed. Just make sure you give yourself enough time because you're going to want to binge it as fast as you can."
"Grim is an understatement.

This is one of the very few shows that I'd bless with a ten star.

It is subtle considering the subject but at the same time does not flinch in away from the harsh and immediate reality.

I'll never love this show but I will forever have had my eyes opened by it.

Shame on the Heathen that gave it 6/10 because of the English accents."
"I can not overstate just how good Chernobyl really is! It's one of the best mini-series ever made, it's right up there with Band of Brothers! It absolutely lives up to all the hype and love it's gotten since it first came out! It's one of the top rated shows ever for a reason... because it's fantastic! If you haven't seen this amazing series yet then make sure you do as soon as possible!"
"I was born in Ukraine, 1971. Parents - Soviet ""intelligentsia"": mother was a high school teacher, father - medical doctor in the military. By the time it happened, we lived near one of the strategic nuclear missile site deep in Siberia. Every year, during the summer school break we used to go to Ukraine, where we spent most of vocation. It should have been the same in 1986, but Chernobyl happened. Official info reiterated that there is nothing to worry about, unless you are in the vicinity of reactor itself. But we all had learned to read between the lines and my farther used his military channels to find out EXACTLY what kind of catastrophe was taking place. He had some info from KGB guys themselves. However, he was reassured that Kiev and certain parts of Ukraine was free of the nuclear fallout and the level of the radioactivity was within normal urban level. He was also clearly warned where NOT TO GO under any circumstances: North-West of Ukraine and big part of Belarus was a heavy fall-out zone. They also mentioned some European countries. Needless to say, that nobody else was talking about this on TV. We made a decision not to change our plans for the summer, but keep in mind those warnings.Each of us had DKP-50A - dosimeter that measures the exposure dose of gamma radiation. We checked the data afterwards and all measures were withing normal limits or less. I remember though, that it was restricted to collect mushrooms or wild berries in the forests anywhere in Ukraine. Any dusty environment was considered dangerous. All water wells were sealed with plastic etc etc Mini series exceeded my expectations. Authors put quite an effort to correctly depict intricate details of this catastrophe. As other reviewers already mentioned, I had noticed so far ( 3 episodes) only minor discrepancies in the overall image of the life in the USSR. People, behavior, political relations etc. Example of such a minuscule inaccuracy - officials, let along common folks, didn't use ""comrade"" as frequently as it might seems from the episodes. It was very formal, official form of addressing. Usually, after first meeting, they addressed each other by the first AND middle name. In the military it was different - ""comrade"" + rank (as in modern Russia, BTW). I'm looking forward to see the rest. I am thankful to the authors and actors for their job. My deep bow to those who lost their lives and health, saving millions of lives. EVERYONE should watch this show and see for himself the kind of horror that can be unleashed in the nuclear war."
"I work as an apprentice within the nuclear industry and I have to say without a doubt that this was the most horrifying thing I have watched in a long time. This isn't due to fact that the show is actually scary per say but it's is because the whole thing is true. This actually happened. Apart of my course so far has been learning about chernobyl so I know in detail the progression of these events and even still I was shocked the way that the show demonstrated how ignorant and naiive they where to what had actually happened.

As far as the show goes the way it is desplayed on screen is mesmerising I can't even begin to imagine how it felt being there at the time wondering what was actually going on but I believe this show is as close a representation as we will get. The acting is excellent you almost forget you are watching a show as the reactions and emotions displayed feel incredibly genuine and beleiveable.

The science included is spot. From my knowledge of how they understood nuclear physics and radiation almost 40 years ago this is very well done whoever was part of the research team was no doubt a veteran within the nuclear industry and it shows as I cannot fault any of the information that is passed across and it is done so in a fair amount of detail.

Overall this is an excellent show so far and I can only imagine it will get better as it goes on and without a doubt will shine a light on the tragic events of what is easily the greatest human error of modern times. I highly recommend this to anyone who is unaware of the consequences of this event and hopefully this will showcase the safety precautions it had inflicted upon the modern nuclear industry as that is just as important as showing what went wrong."
"As a person who comes from a country that was ruled by the Communism, I have a good idea of how it was, because we still suffer the consequences of the most inhumane regime in the mankind history and the worst of them are not the economical ones, but the moral.

The mentality of how the actions, the conversations, the people are is right how it happened. There are a lot of great details in every scene: objects, colors. The clock I saw in the very first seconds of Episode 1 is something so common - it was present at home as well. The way the most vile and uneducated scums got promoted to the highest position is what happens even today in the post-communist countries - exactly as in Episode 2 and the ex-shoe factory low life that is now Deputy Secretary and who ""prefers his own opinion over the one of a scientists"" - this is devastating for a nation and its talents.

But what hurt most is the end: that it's all based on lies. Of hiding information. As it happened in Bulgaria: the Government not only hid the disaster from the people, but the politicians of the highest ranking hid their families and were feeding them with imported products, while the nation was even left to go on the regular parade for the 1st of May. And then the Government revealed it to the people like something minor. And you can imagine the consequences that are still ongoing.

So for those of you who want to know a bit more how it was living in Communism, how and why the Chernobyl disaster happened, for those of you who want to see a masterpiece of cinema work - go for the mini-series."
On first viewing this excellent and entertaining show I have it full marks. I believed it to be a scientifically accurate account of the disaster. It spurred me to do my own research on the subject and it transpires that too much of the show is over dramatised unfortunately. It's left me feeling a bit duped really.
"This film is a beautifully made anti-Soviet and anti-Russian propaganda. How cost the lie? You can see the cost of this HBO Series to understand how much. 20% of the film is true facts and 80% hypocritical lies. The art of the producers is how the true facts are subtly woven into the web of lies. People who have never seen documentary films about this catastrophe will never be able to determine this fact.

Some facts - Legasov was not a physicist, he was a chemist! At that time, the Soviet Union was dry law and therefore no one could give a soldier or other worked people the vodka! Legasov's report at the IAEA was never challenged by anyone until now.

Scherbina was an engineer by education, she was in charge of the energy sector of the Soviet industry and therefore knew the structure of the nuclear power plant well.

Both Shcherbina and Legasov were communists (they were members of the Communist Party), and also were the elite of Soviet society, and therefore, as shown in the film, they could not communicate disrespectfully among themselves. Scientists in Soviet society greatly respected scientists.

Legasov and Shcherbina did not attend the trial and therefore did not reveal any ""truth"".

""The bridge of death"" - that was what the locals called him before the explosion, because a motorcyclist died in this place several years ago. And it was just a local story. Since the explosion occurred at 2 am, no one came to the bridge, everyone was asleep !!!!

Check this facts himself and know how cost the lie."
"This will go down in history. This will be shown in schools. Truly shocking and extremely realistic. And that's coming from an ex-Soviet citizen. I was amazed how detailed everything was, even the representation of the evil Soviet regime. Totally on point. And that was just the first episode, can't wait for more."
"An infamous world event captured in a riveting series. Chernobyl provides so much depth and wider information into the disaster by following the various lives and stories of those involved, the plot remains gripping beyond the event itself, and the aftermath takes complete scrutiny.

Deeply unsettling and painful to watch at times, the effects of radiation poisoning are explicitly shown in all its horrors, and as horrible as it is to see, the makeup and costuming department must be commended. Everything in the series is visually stunning, staying truthful to history whilst always creating the correct atmosphere on screen.

The truth is ultimately as sinister and concerning as any fictional horror/drama could envision. The politics involved at every step are explained well without removing from the intelligence of the dialogue. The addition of one character is justifiable to remove a cinematic mess of attempting to include dozens of science within a coherent script. Remaining close to the facts only adds to the power of the series.

The casting is brilliant, the addition of multiple UK comedic actors in such serious roles only improves it, with the late Paul Ritter particularly standing out in his performance. None of the cast can be flawed, and there is no ambiguity over unnecessarily dodgy accents.

Whilst baring all, the Chernobyl series remains respectful, yet damning to those responsible. It is historically important, and an absolute must-watch."
"Someone is responsible for making this such an outstanding show, year after year. The intelligence in dialogue, empathy for characters, twists and expectations are genius. Breaking bad, The X Files are 2 other badges of brilliance. We are privileged to be living in this time as we might have been if living during Shakespeare. This may seem over the top but the scores are on the board, Vince Gilligan. Please correct or remove if I am wrong!"
"People who are fans of Breaking Bad should definitely watch this it expands the Albuquerque criminal underworld to unparalleled heights. It's easily one of the most tragic, beautifully written and directed shows of all time and for me at least is at the top of the list of my favourite shows it's tied with Breaking Bad. I'm not really someone who's into the crime genre but this show as well as Breaking Bad are two all time great crime dramas that I actually LOVE. It's a master class of writing and direction. This show is the fastest show I've binged I finished the first 4 seasons in a matter of 3 days. Season 5 isn't out in Canada on Netflix yet."
"As of today, it's officially been 9 years since Better Call Saul was released. It's been a little over a year since the finale aired and I'm still mesmerized about how this crew lead by Peter Gould & Vince Gilligan pulled it off, again.

When Breaking Bad reached its finale, it was hard for me to imagine any other show being able to reach it's level, let alone arguably surpass it. And when I heard that there was a spin-off regarding Saul Goodman, I thought maybe the show could have some solid and funny moments, and maybe bring a bit of depth towards some beloved Breaking Bad characters.

Spin-offs in television are usually seen to me as fan service, or a way to make more money off of a franchise that was loved. That doesn't mean that all of them are bad, but most of them don't have the passion or care that'd make you think it was extremely necessary to make a spin-off, especially considering the risk of making previous characters look bad writing wise. And while Better Call Saul was AMC's idea to make more money off of the franchise, I'm shocked with how the creators and writers were able to make another masterpiece.

This show was always meant to be in the shadow of Breaking Bad in my eyes, and I never would've thought of these shows as something that'd be deserving to talk about in the same breath as one another. But Better Call Saul took the ball that Breaking Bad was rolling, picked it up, and launched it forward.

While I think Breaking Bad has peaks that no other show can reach, Better Call Saul was able to do things that it's predecessor never could. The depth and writing of these characters are honestly perfect. So much so that I'd consider the shows leads Jimmy and Kim to be two of the best written characters in television history. And while the cast of this show is extremely stacked, Chuck McGill to me is a character that's honestly overlooked compared to the rest. His character has a pretty clear consensus amongst most people, but there's so much to him and Jimmy's dynamic that's it's honestly not as black and white as most people make it out to be, despite both being objectively wrong in certain aspects of the series. It's really fascinating to me.

The main aspect of the show that baffles me is how perfectly timed the arcs are considering this is a prequel. Every event in the show is written so well and is paced in a brilliant way to the point where no character arc seems to be rushed, yet the show still remains interesting. You think you've reached the pinnacle of a characters journey, then a curveball is thrown that changes everything.

That's not even mentioning how balanced both the lawyer side and the cartel side of the show are. When I first started the show I was eager to get more of the Mike and cartel portion, but the lawyer side of the story honestly paved the way for the first half of this show and was the most compelling part of the first 3 seasons.

My word of advice to anyone who watches this show.

1. Be patient 2. Understand that this is not Breaking Bad.

At some point the show will get very intense, but enjoy what arcs you are given at the time because before you know it, you'll look back and realize you were in the good times of the show. If you watch Better Call Saul after watching Breaking Bad, you might ask for one thing early on. But when you actually get it, you'll realize that the destination wasn't the key, but it was the journey to get there.

Considering most of the characters in this show were never even supposed to exist, it's safe to call Better Call Saul a miracle in television. Whether that was because of an actor wanting to be written off, an actor having a busy filming schedule, or a throw away line that created two of the greatest characters in the entire universe, it's amazing that Breaking Bad was able to pave the way for one of the greatest shows of all time. But what's even more impressive is Better Call Saul makes it to where Breaking Bad is not even complete without its existence.

Kudos to Peter Gould, Vince Gilligan and the entire crew that returned to create Better Call Saul, and I'm grateful I got to experience this universe come to a close."
"Had heard nothing but amazing things about 'Better Call Saul' (with nothing bad), with it being one of the most highly regarded shows in recent years. Am a huge fan of 'Breaking Bad', so was really psyched in seeing its prequel 'Better Call Saul' too. My opinion of Bob Odenkirk is also very high, so there was absolutely no way this was going to be missed. Have binged on many shows in the past seven years or so and was determined for this to be one of them, very like 'Breaking Bad'.

'Better Call Saul' was every bit as amazing as reputed. Have seen many shows that started off wonderfully but declined badly in their final seasons, a few with really bad last episodes ('House of Cards', 'Game of Thrones', 'Killing Eve'), but then there are rarities like 'Breaking Bad' where every season was at least positively received and on the most part universally acclaimed. 'Better Call Saul' is another one of the rarities and is the first show seen in a long time to not have a bad episode in it, since 'Breaking Bad'. Seriously compelling and addictive stuff and exceptional in every area.

Visually, 'Better Call Saul' is one of those shows that is both stylish and beautiful, with photography and editing that are cinematic quality and put a lot of films today to shame, where there are a lot of visually beautiful ones but also some painfully amateurish looking ones. The music always has the appropriate mood, never too intrusive, never too muted.

The writing for 'Better Call Saul' is a fine example to all shows of how to have a lot of style but also to have a lot of substance. The dialogue throughout is thought-provoking and tense, although quite talky, while also have a darkly wicked sense of humour and heart-tugging pathos. The stories are texturally rich, intimate, tense and layered, with the pace of them consistently deliberate but taut. The pull no punches and gritty approach to the subject was often chilling and harrowing to watch. The direction couldn't be better.

Likewise with the acting, with Odenkirk on absolutely towering form throughout as one of television's most fascinating and meatiest leading characters, one that one is repulsed by but also one that is not hard to sympathise with in some situations. Rhea Seehorn and Michael McKean are excellent as well, McKean giving one of his best work in years. The character writing is rich and compellingly real.

Concluding, truly outstanding show. 10/10."
"Better Call Saul is not only considered one of the best shows of the last few years but it's also considered one of the best shows of all-time! The acting & storytelling are so good that it really does becomes addictive to watch. There's a reason why this show is one of the highest rated shows on this site and why it's always nominated for so many awards and that's because it's freaking amazing! People always want to compare it to Breaking Bad because it's a spin-off but don't. Even though it has the same feel and it's not quite as good as Breaking Bad, it's pretty darn close! I, along with everyone else who watched, was worried how they would end the show and hoping they wouldn't mess it up (like so many other great shows tend to do). Well, they didn't! The ending was fantastic and will go down as one of the better finales to a great show. If you are a fan of Breaking Bad then this is an absolute must watch!"
"""Breaking Bad"" was undeniably one of the greatest shows of the 21st century. If you then hear that one of the characters got a spinoff show, you could be forgiven for doubting the quality. Well, doubt no more. ""Better Call Saul"" is an equally fine piece of work.

The protagonist is lawyer Saul Goodman (Bob Odenkirk), who it turns out is actually named Jimmy McGill. He engages in all manner of shady activity, while other characters from the previous show have their own things to deal with. As with the previous show, it's a serial, with episodes ending in cliffhangers. And make no mistake, you'll want to keep watching.

Basically, it's the type of series that you have to see to believe. There have been lawyer shows and crime dramas, but never have they gotten combined so splendidly. It's the perfect mix of comedy, tragedy and thriller. Definitely see it."
"One thing that stopped me from watching this movie is because I knew this show has nothing to do with Walter White, the man that makes Breaking Bad, Breaking Bad. I believe most people also think the same.

Personally, after rewatching Breaking Bad few times, I have come to the conclusion that there is nobody in the show that I love from the beginning until the last second. What I like the most is the character development for all the important characters.

Then? What does it have to do with Better Call Saul? I believe I love this show as much as Breaking Bad because of the exact reason. I REALLY love how every character behaves and develops in this show. What more fascinating is, this show has everything you like from Breaking Bad. Tension, emotions, atmosphere, character flaws, good antagonists, you name it. One other similarity this show has, this show gets better when it is closer to the end. (I know, it has not ended yet) You really don't want to miss every second of it.

I can assure you, all Breaking Bad fans, your love to this show will be AT LEAST as big as your love to Breaking Bad. Easiest 10/10 after Breaking Bad."
"This show deserves more recognition. Better Call Saul is the most clever show I have ever watched. The acting, cinematography, the story, the writing, it's amazing. Some times even better than Breaking Bad."
"Better Call Saul has a 8.9 rating for a reason and that's because it's fantastic! It's absolutely one of the best shows ever created! The acting, writing, storytelling, etc are all as good as anything that's ever been on television. This was Emmy nominated for most outstanding drama every season it was on. The cast, led by Bob Odenkirk, are all amazing and all perfectly cast. There's not a weak link on the entire series. This is one of the rare spinoffs that is as good as the original. I'm blown away how they kept this show feeling so fresh and where every season is incredible. If you haven't seen this show yet then do yourself a favor and go watch it as soon as you can. Just warning you now though to give yourself enough time because you're going to want to binge it as fast as you can!"
"So here it is at last: one of the most highly anticipated new TV-shows of the year, the spin-off from probably THE most highly praised TV-show in the history of Television. Naturally, expectations were over the roof - and it was a forgone conclusion that meeting those expectations would be next to impossible. Well, here's the good news. Judging from the first couple of episodes, 'Better Call Saul' will be good. Just how good remains to be seen, but as far as promises go, those first episodes made a big one.

For those who haven't seen it yet: relax - I won't spoil a thing about the storyline. Instead, I'll concentrate on all other aspects of the show. The first thing you notice (as was the case with Breaking Bad) is the camera. The photography is simply gorgeous. All the visual trademarks I've grown to love so much in BB are there: the playful camera angles; the creative ways to establish even a simple scene with unusual, interesting shots (yet without ever distracting from the storytelling) - it's just beautiful to look at.

Then there's the music. From the wonderful introductions (before the opening credits) to the last scene of an episode, music is not just used as background ""noise"": carefully picked songs are there to give clues and are as much an integral part of the story as they help establish the tone of certain scenes. And the original music by Dave Porter feels as organic to 'Better Call Saul' as it did in 'Breaking Bad'.

The writing, directing and acting (so far) are on par with BB; anyone afraid this would be a rushed production trying to surf on BB's success can relax; not for a second did I get the feeling this was somehow not well thought through or cheaply constructed by a committee of writers - and although we do of course get some of our favorite characters back, new ones are introduced that promise to be just as original and interesting as the ones that helped turn BB into a cultural phenomenon. And adding high calibre actors such as Michael McKean ('This Is Spinal Tap') to the cast is probably an indication that Vince Gilligan and Peter Gould will not content themselves - or us - by mainly exploring the characters we already know.

And then, finally, there's the magnificent Bob Odenkirk. Starting off as a slightly one-dimensional character and comic relief in BB, the character we've come to love as the sleazy, slick Saul Goodman has already shown more layers in the first half of the first season of 'Better Call Saul' than over his entire run on BB. And that's as much thanks to Odenkirk as the fantastic writing: the actor obviously relished the opportunity to show what he's capable of as his character charms, squirms and threatens his way through his scenes, but - somewhat unexpectedly - he also manages to move you during the more quiet moments.

To sum up my overall impressions: 'Better Call Saul' is a darkly comic, multilayered story that could end up being just as unusual and exciting as we all dared to hope. The tone may be consistent with 'Breaking Bad', but make no mistake: this is very much its own thing. The writing, directing and acting - as well as the production values - are top notch, and if what we've seen so far is anything to go by, we're in for a great first season of a very promising new show. My (provisional) rating: 9 stars out of 10

"Let's face facts: Spin-off TV shows tend to fare poorly to the original content. I was furious when I heard about the spin-off to the amazing Break Bad. Nonetheless centering around the buffoonish clown of a character Saul Goodman?! I was livid and heartbroken. I wanted Breaking bad to end on a high note and not let this potential disaster ruin it's legacy.

Breaking Bad was an absolute masterpiece of a show, with an amazing story, script, cinematography; you name it, it's there. But the one thing that made Breaking Bad shine, and in my option, be one of the greatest series ever made was it's deep, deep burial into the characters that made us either absolutely love or loath them. It didn't rely on special effects and had no fat to it whatsoever. No other show encapsulated a slow unfurling of characters so well that it was as if we were getting to know them in our real lives.

I finally decided to give Better Call Saul a shot after hating it's first episode on release. I figured, maybe I could eventually forget about the fact that it was attached to my favorite TV show, and when everybody who watches it is telling you it's amazing, there must be something there.. right?

Boy, were they right. Better Call Saul is just as good as it's predecessor. It maintains it's very high standard to every aspect of the production, and most of all, character development, motivation and relationships are centerfold once more. It is easy to find Better Call Saul even better than Breaking Bad, although I would chalk this up to it being more current and therefore more in the forefront of our minds in the Breaking Bad universe. If you, like me, have hesitated to give this show a shot for the same reasons, stop it. Let yourself feel uncomfortable for the 1st half of the first season, and then let it get it's clutches into you.

I'm so, so very happy I finally decided to give Better Call Saul a shot again 4 years later. With no hesitation, 10/10."
With every episode it gets heated a bit...... and you won't even realise when the water stars boiling......
"Better Call Saul has its moments but the really good episodes are very few and far between. There's a lot of dragging out in this series, some episodes are just a load of different, boring subplots that you have no interest in but you just sit through it hoping that something interesting will start happening eventually; and it does, but it's a very slow climb to get to a point where the plot really starts to grab your attention.

I'd say it's definitely worth watching for those golden moments, just be prepared to sit through a lot of slow-paced waffle. The latest series (5) has been the best so far in my opinion, because the main plot is finally starting to take over all the subplots and the show is becoming a bit more action-packed.

I wouldn't say this series is better than Breaking Bad purely because the pacing is terrible, but it has been nice to see what was going on with all the characters before Walter and Jesse came along, and it looks like as we move from season 5 to 6, Vince is starting to make up for all the boredom the viewers have had to endure up to this point.

Overall, it's a pretty good series, worth watching, but I think 10 stars is a bit over-the-top for something that crawls along as much as it does."
"(Just a rhetorical question. I don't really want an answer.)

Over a few days, I watched all 10 episodes of season 1. The show seemed to be popular and I wondered what I was missing.

I'm still wondering. I can't think of any reason to watch the show.

1) Characters are unrelatable and unsympathetic.

2) The..... pace....... drags........ so........ so....... so....... so....... slowly. (""Did we fill an hour yet?"")

3) The ""plot twists"" are ridiculously predictable unless you're about 9 years old or less. If this show surprises you...well it shouldn't.

4) The writers jump multiple barracudas in each show. Things that CAN'T happen in real-life pass for normality. Yet none of the anti- reality events are used to advance whatever hint of a plot the series has.

5) Lots of silly, unforced issues with minorities and women.

I think the acting is pretty good. (For example, Rhea Seahorn has to convince us an attractive, intelligent, well-employed woman with little free time is willing squander it to platonically mother a pathetic, unreliable schlub. ACTING!) The actors try to save the weak writing.

The filming is well done and the retro mood is usually witty and only slightly overplayed.

This might have been a decent 90-minute movie where you walk in, walk out, and move on. But as a series, it was painful to watch. I was glad episode 10 showed no hint of sucking me into season 2. It was a relief to hit the delete button and free up dvr space."
"Yet another masterpiece delivered by the amazing Vince Gilligan. Everything about this show is almost perfect. The writing, acting, cinematography are just beautiful. Also one of my favourite aspects about this show is the character development, and how well it covers two different parts of it's whole timeline (Jimmy/Saul's life at first and then getting into Gus Fring and the Cartel), something that hasn't been done as well in Breaking Bad. I truly think this show is one of the most underrated around and would definitely recommend watching it"
"Many people say that this show is better than the show that started it all, Breaking Bad. And while I don't agree with that, Better Call Saul puts up a really good fight and ultimately has become my second favorite TV show of all time(the first being Breaking Bad). If you go into this show expecting it to be similar to Breaking Bad, you're not going to enjoy it. Even though they are in the same universe, Breaking Bad and Better Call Saul are pretty different. There are two stories being told in the show. One story is the story of James M. McGill,(Saul Goodman in Breaking Bad) a man who's struggling with his career as a lawyer. And the other story is the story of Mike Ehrmantraut, a man who gets involved with the world of crime. Similar to the film Inglourious Basterds (2009), the show tells two different stories that collide for the ending. Each story builds up, adding more and more details to the plot until they both get to a point where they collaborate in an incredible and jaw-dropping finale. The show is also masterful at making the viewer understand exactly how each of the characters think and act. It makes you feel like your best friends with each of the characters in the sense that you know everything about them. What makes them angry, what makes them happy, what their interests are, etc. The show also has many easter eggs to Breaking Bad and answers some of the questions that were never answered in the show. The cinematography is also phenomenal. From the variety of bright and beautiful colors, to the camera angles, it's gorgeous to look at. Another great thing in the show is one of the many themes portrayed in it. That theme being that the law isn't perfect. Jimmy and other lawyers are able to use many different loopholes in the justice system to get their way. The final episode especially, shows that even though many people think of the law as sacred, it is anything but perfect. The acting is also great with Bob Odenkirk giving a phenomenal performance. Another story that this show tells is the story of Saul Goodman after the events of Breaking Bad, which are filmed in beautiful black and white. This part of the show is especially entertaining to the Breaking Bad fans. All in all, if you liked Breaking Bad, I would highly recommend this show. In my opinion, it was definitely worth my time. 10/10."
I don't remembering rating and reviewing a TV show before but for better call Saul I had to. Its just too good.
"Exceptional cast just as good as Breaking Bad, writing is superb, soundtrack is so good, cinematography shots are very nice, and entertainment value is bomb! I'm surprised Bob Odenkirk hasn't won any of the Emmy nominations he's been up for. I'm a few seasons in when I started the series I wasn't reviewing then, glad I'm watching the show again I forgot how good it is. I love that the same crew from Breaking Bad is involved!"
"I loved every second of the first two episodes of Better Call Saul. We are beginning the season with many strings left untied but I have complete faith in all questions being answered. If you loved Breaking bad for all the reasons I did including the cinematography, music, scenery, characters and most of all the story line, then you will love this. I apologize for going slightly off topic but in looking back at the breaking bad episode with the fly in the lab, some people found that they did not enjoy this episode, I on the other hand loved it. I appreciate the pure genius of the directing that goes behind every minute of the show. I understand and respect that people are entitled to their own opinion but after reading the negative reviews given here about ""Better Call Saul"" all I can say is that they don't get it, and that is OK. It is worth a watch because if you end up enjoying the show you wont just like it, you will love it. This is the next life changing show that will become something you look forward to for many years. I am truly excited for what's to come."
If you have seen breaking bad and haven't seen this masterpiece of a show and you're hesitating don't just watch the first episode of the show and it will hook you but if you haven't seen breaking bad i suggest that you should watch breaking bad first forget the timeline and forget that breaking bad is after better call saul there are some things in breaking bad that are presentend as mysteries and if you watch this they are no more mysterious and no more exciting.
The 2 seasons are kinda slow but trust me it gets better every episode and i love all of the scenes in Better Call Saul!
"If you liked Breaking Bad's ""Fly"" episode, then this show is for you. Otherwise there is very little of Breaking Bad here - almost nothing of the story, the pace, the quality or even the Saul Goodman humor.

*Breaking Bad Spoiler warning* Think of this. By episode 1 in Breaking Bad, Walt is already a cook, they're already dealing, have the RV and have killed someone and have another hostage. Walt has cancer, revealed it to the family, met Tuco, the Tuco attack on Jesse, Tuco kidnapping of the two, Hank killing Tuco, and Walt explaining his fugue state to the family and I still skipped a lot of events.

I am currently 11 episodes into BCS and the whole first season could be fit into 2 or 3 episodes. It is short on events and long with takes.

There is a scene where the camera zooms in to show graffiti and it takes about 30 seconds to show ""(I) was here"" when it could've done it in 10. There are a lot of mood setting and establishing shots that are made into scenes. A Cinnabon branch's closing routine is shown in full, including locking up the bottled water/juice, taking out the trash, the walk across the closed mall, etc.

The events are non-events - James playing with a light-switch is not interesting in any way.

The story doesn't seem to be heading in any direction. The episodes end without suspense, cliffhangers or even the slightest curiosity - you simply never feel like you need to watch the next one.

I feel as if all this material could've been great as a side dish for a real story. Instead it's a lot of filler but no real meat.

Breaking Bad was great because it had a great story to tell, great characters, quotes, music, drama and comedy. This one has none of those things. No great dialogues or quotes, forgettable soundtrack, no humor like Breaking Bad (Jesse, Saul, so many jokes), the drama is very little, and the characters, well, other than James and slightly Mike, there isn't much to write home about.

It's simply not an enjoyable show and it does not look like it'll get better."
"""Better Call Saul"" stands out as a masterpiece in television history for its impeccable storytelling, complex characters, and brilliant craftsmanship. Set as a prequel to the renowned series ""Breaking Bad,"" it delves deep into the evolution of the beloved character, Saul Goodman, portrayed by the exceptional Bob Odenkirk. What makes ""Better Call Saul"" extraordinary is its meticulous attention to detail, meticulously weaving together intricate plotlines that captivate audiences from start to finish. The show's character development is unparalleled, allowing viewers to witness the transformation of Jimmy McGill into the morally ambiguous lawyer, Saul Goodman, with depth and nuance. The moral ambiguity of its characters adds layers of complexity, making every decision and action thought-provoking and compelling. The writing is sharp and intelligent, filled with witty dialogue and subtle nods to its predecessor, ""Breaking Bad."" Moreover, the cinematography and direction elevate the storytelling, creating visually stunning scenes that immerse viewers in the gritty world of Albuquerque. From its gripping courtroom drama to its heart-wrenching personal struggles, ""Better Call Saul"" offers a rich and multifaceted narrative that keeps viewers on the edge of their seats. Its exploration of themes such as morality, ambition, and the pursuit of identity resonates deeply with audiences, provoking introspection and sparking conversations long after the credits roll. In essence, ""Better Call Saul"" is not just a television show; it's a work of art that sets the standard for excellence in storytelling and cements its place as one of the greatest shows of all time."
Narcos is such a great show it's hard to explain just how good it really is. Wagner Moura and Pedro Pescal lead an amazing cast who suck you right into the show. There have been a lot of shows about drug cartels but this is without a doubt the best and it's bit close! It really is addicting once you start watching and you get used the subtitles pretty quick.
"Narcos is just a flat out great show. Its just so gritty and realistic. It's about the rise and fall of one of the most notorious drug lords, Pablo Escobar. It also follows other drug cartels throughout the years and how they do business. It's about real life events which they execute almost perfectly. Wagner Moura as Pablo Escobar especially is just incredible. He resembles Pablo Escobar as good as any actor has ever tried. Almost half the show is in Spanish but you get used the subtitles and forget about them pretty quickly. Once you start watching this you'll want to binge it as quickly as possible. It's that good!"
"As a native Colombian, born and raised in Medellin (in 1975) and victim myself of the Pablo Escobar era, I must say that I am pleasantly surprised with the show!!! I thought it was going to be another bad gringo movie about Colombia with lots of mistakes and not even Colombian landscapes in the background but, I WAS WRONG!!!! Very good actors too, I didn't like Escobar accent since it's not real Paisa accent but it's OK; it will go unnoticed to non- native Colombians ;)

Good Job Netflix!! Sksjdjdjdufirjfjfifrior difjrirjfjfkririfrjrjrkf. That's all I had to say

"Incidentally, I saw an ad for Narco on YouTube, and instead of skipping the ads like I normally do, I played this one out because I was genuinely excited for what I was watching. Instantly I jumped onto Netflix and I was not disappointed. This is a truly gripping show, one of the best I've seen this year. The characters and acting are done well and the storyline moves at a fast enough pace to get your adrenalin pumping for the whole episode. My only fear was that it would be too generic of a Crime drama, but those feelings were quickly swept away. This is truly an original and thoroughly planned out TV show with a whole lot of heart.

Maybe the best on Netflix at the moment. Narco doesn't disappoint with any aspect of the show. It's exciting and fast paced, but above all, it makes you want to keep coming back for more."
"Narcos is an intriguing and entertaining series. Netflix again done a very good job. Season 1 tells the true story of notorious drug kingpin Pablo Escobar, who became a billionaire through the production and distribution of cocaine, while also focusing on Escobar's interactions with drug lords. This is a massive story.

Escobar's life has attracted my attention too. I watched many videos and read books about Escobar's life. The show educates you on the Medellin Cartel and it is a very interesting topic to learn about. Pablo Escobar had much more influence on the political system than i would expected. This series has added a lot to me about it. Wagner Moura is an excellent actor and he learned Spanish just for the Pablo Escobar's role. He was born for this role. The bilingual dialogue adds a new layer of authenticity to the project and shows it's commitment with the original story. The long and often complicated story of Pablo Escobar is portrayed simple and effective for viewers not to get lost in what is going on.

Congrats to Netflix for such a powerful, incredible production. I would recommend this show to all my friends and anyone looking for a great show to watch. This is one of the best shows I've seen in a while. Can't wait for the next season to come out! 10/10"
"This is such a quality production. Its cinema quality in every aspect. I've seen two episodes so far but if this show keep this up I give it an even higher grade. Netflix is now really starting to compete with HBO and this is much better than Netflix anchor House of Cards for example.

Now I don't like shows that glorify and make the criminals heroes, but I don't think this series does that. Escobar is a ruthless person but still his a family man in some ways. Whats good with Narcos is that it portrays both side of the law. If it would only show it from Pablos perspective it wouldn't be as interesting.

This is a very classy production. Everything from the DEA-detective who is the narrative voice to the quality of the camera work. The actors are spot on and the scenes are amazing. I nearly feel that I'm in the Colombian jungle and the hot humid air touches me through the screen.

I just love series nowadays. You can transport you self to nearly every situation of life and follow character for a long time. And they really use the advantages of series if you compare it to film."
"It's beautiful , this's the way TV-series should be directed and produced, i loved the fast pace of the series from the first minute till now i haven't skipped anything or felt bored.

The narration way of the story from the first beginning adds another depth to the story.

It shows you scenes from the future then gets to the present to elaborate how we reached that point .

The cast is great , probably you haven't seen anyone of them before , but sure as hell they can act , they are able to deliver the feeling they have so you can interact with them .

Simply , a masterpiece .

P.S : Netflix has always been picky about its series, that''s why it's my favorite network."
"Alright so, when it comes to drug related TV Shows which almost always include the DEA, the first thing that comes to mind is Breaking Bad and The Wire.

Needless to say, while preparing to start up the pilot, I continuously tried to imagine how can this series give us something original or even something that will make us say ""Hey, this isn't a cheap knock off of something."" Well. I was profoundly surprised. Netflix has done it again.

They managed to present the show in a way that includes every positive aspect of the two aforementioned series. It has the darkness of Breaking Bad, the intensity and the smart writing while also maintaining the thoroughness of The Wire in the sense that we get to see both sides of the drug trade, the clichés and even the everyday life that surrounds it.

The narrative style also gives it a different aspect which helps the viewer engage in a more positive way. The cast seems to be very specifically chosen since the roles don't even make you question the legitimacy of the actors.

I would say that this looks promising although I am yet to finish the series to be able to give my final word.

Definitely a series you should watch if you are into this kind of thing.

Kudos again, Netflix."
"Since movies have become nothing but shoot-em-ups and comic books television has emerged as the way to get great drama to adults.

Narcos is a tale that everyone knows today, but the storytelling of this series is done with great visuals, interesting casting and a storytelling format which I love.

Using the protagonist as the voice over narrator gives this series the feel of Goodfellas or Casino (two of my favourite movies by the way).

Its extremely watchable and kept my attention the whole time. The scene with Pablo Escobar on the bridge was stunning.

A worthwhile watch, if you have interests in things other than comic books."
Binged all 3 seasons and Mexico in 2 weeks. It's so good you just can't stop watching!
"'Narcos' tells the extraordinary story of Pablo Escobar, a Columbian who rose to the top of a massive drug smuggling enterprise. The series has been highly praised, but I didn't like it that much. Told from the perspective of U.S. government agents, it paints a picture where those agents are tough as hell but essentially heroic, and there's relatively little interest in the everyday lives of ordinary Columbians (or indeed, of Americans addicted to the drugs Escobar smuggled). Whereas series like 'The Wire' have shown us drug barons who, while grotesque, remain human, 'Narcos' is more about spectacle, and a story whose morality is fundamentally black and white. The details of Escobar's tale are amazing; but I didn't feel I got much in the way of deep insight by watching this show."
"The Topic of Pablo Escobar is one i would consider highly interesting, but the way its executed here just isnt. Production value is top, sets, effects and so on, they all fit perfectly together, but thats not all a series needs. The problems I have with this series is, that I have nothing and no one to care about. The american cop coming to colombia with his wife doesnt really connect with me. There are so many interesting parts that get brushed over, he builds his whole gigantic drug empire practically in one episode and yet they feel hollow. I would like to see how Pablo was before, how his persona changes (because everyone earning that much all of a sudden changes), how the people arround him deal with the changes, his friends his family. When we see them all for the first time, they were already in on it. The same could be said about the DEA agents. We get a few lines of narations how it was before and how it was after Pablo took power and suddenly hes already travelling to colombia. In my opinion there are two ways to make this more interesting:

make a documentary out of it, the things the narator says, the insane riches and the high number of casualties are both shocking and fascinating, but they get padded with crap I dont care about. By that I mostly mean the DEAs work, I mean theres no mystery, no chase not anything. They´re just tracking down little flies in the opperation and when they get them, they are already dead. Furthermore you already know how the story ends, so the other way this could get me on board would be the polar opposite of a documentary:

Get closer to specific people, weather they are in the DEA, the local police departments or within Pablos operation. People we care about, interesting characters, show their traits, weaknesses hobbies and business. This would be slow and a lot of things would be fictional, but I find the way the series is told right now to be painfully boring and Im really not someone who needs a lot of action.

I know this is a ridiculously high standard, but lets compare this with breaking bad (actually the rating is pretty close to BB). Each episode has a lot less things happening, but because of that, we can focus on them and because we get to love and hate the characters and explore them, just like they explore themselves, we are getting engaged in whats happening to them, everything has more of an impact. We keep asking ourselves, how far will he/she go? In Narcos we get Pablo ordering street shootings in the first few episodes and whats worse for me: you dont even see or hear him doing it (Oh yea, the cop also shoots people in the first few episodes, but after he has 1 minute of sadness coming home from work, its almost like it never happened). You dont see the expression in his face when he has to make these decision, not even see him plotting or anything. For me all of these characters end up feeling hollow and more like plot-devices instead of people. Also, they die within a few episodes anyway, so why should we care?

Judging from the marvellous reviews I dont have much company thinking like that. While I even have a few friends who binge-watched this thing, I had to force myself watching this after the second episode was over, but eventually gave up towrds the end ofseason 1."
"This Netflix series charts the rise and fall of the Colombian drug lords as their power increases as they earn billions of US dollars supplying the United States with cocaine and the actions of the DEA as they try to bring them to justice. The first two seasons are centred on Pablo Escobar and his Medellin cartel and DEA Agents Steve Murphy and Javier Peña while the third sees Peña leading the hunt for the 'Gentlemen of Cali', the cartel which eventually took over from Escobar.

The story shown is based on reality but the makers never pretend that it is entirely true... a pre-title card informs us that some characters are entirely fictional. That doesn't stop it feeling real thanks to the way events are depicted. The characters are shown in a matter of fact way leaving it to the viewer to judge them... of course given what we see some of them do it isn't hard to condemn many of them. Even so surprisingly few characters are totally unsympathetic at all times. The cast does a really impressive job bringing their characters to life; most obviously Pedro Pascal as Javier Peña and Wagner Moura as Pablo Escobar. Many people have commented about incorrect accents but I doubt this will be a problem for non-Spanish speakers; it was certainly better than having all characters speaking English. Overall I found the series really gripping; I'll certainly be watching 'Narcos: Mexico' soon."
"Loved it from start to finish. I did not care that I spent most of the time reading English subtitles, this entire series left me wanting and wishing I could speak Spanish. It's simply superb! Not once was I bored, I did not want this to finish, I knew nothing about Pablo's life, but man, what a life he lived. You have to see this to believe it!"
"Having seen all Padilha movies, I was anxious to see this new Netflix series and had great expectations. He did it again. I cannot stop watching. One episode after another. OK if the cast is not Colombian. But they are all good actors and play the parts very well. I will try to finish this weekend all the episodes but i think there will be more seasons. Best series of the year so far. The action is great. The scenarios are perfect. The 1980's atmosphere is awesome. 10 out 0f 10. I hope they will make more series like that in the future. Good real stories and perfect action and direction. I could not expect less from Padilha."
"Now, with the knowledge that most of the events shown are fictional and some real events altered for dramatic effect, I appreciate what the show set out to do.

The antagonist is written in such a way that you feel sympathy for the worst of the worst, an evil cruel monster. Only good writing can do that. I admit though, this wouldn't have been as impactful if not for the phenomenal supporting cast!

In terms of Audio, Visuals, Acting, this Series is one of the best.

Just remember, that this Series is not a documentary, so if you want facts you should research it yourself, the antagonist's real life counterpart was far, far more evil than depicted.

All in all, it's a good watch that shows how sickening mankind can be when Hope is lost. But at the same time, that there will always be those who will stand against Evil."
"Such a great show! Though the topic of drugs and the war on drugs is so ""easy"", it can still be appropriated to screen so poorly. I found Narcos akin to The Wire in terms of doing honor to the subject matter in a multi-layered way.

It's a gritty show and unlike The Wire, it's more true crime/fact-based. The show gives fascinating insights into the inner workings of drug/crime syndicates and the level of risk people will take to transport them across borders and into other countries. It tells of the brutality of drug lords and the lengths they'll go to make profit. The acting, cinematography and script are first class."
"Narcos is definitely one of my favorite series.

The series may not be for many because you have to read subtitles almost non-stop, but Wagner Moura in the role of Pablo Escobar is VERY convincing in my opinion.

The series does a very good job of telling Escobar's story from his point of view.

Steve Murphy is also very well portrayed and as such serves as the viewer's companion through the series.

I stopped watching after the second season, because I didn't saw a sense in watching further at this point, but many people told me that the series went downhill after this point, so I guess I made the right decision here."
"(Reviewed after Season 3).

The history of the Colombian drug cartels, and the US DEA's efforts to bring them to justice. Seasons 1 and 2 focus on the Medellin Cartel and its infamous leader, Pablo Escobar. Season 3 centres on the successor to the Medellin Cartel, the Cali Cartel.

Superb. Edifying, enthralling and incredibly engaging - compelling viewing. A good mix of history, drama, action and intrigue. Well-drawn and developed characters - even the bad guys have character depth.

Shows well the mountain of a task that faced the DEA in bringing Colombia's cocaine manufacturers to justice, as even the local police and politicians couldn't be trusted.

Adding to the authenticity is that about 80% of the dialogue is in Spanish. No Colombians speaking English to each other in a Spanish accent. (There are English sub-titles, of course, should you want them).

Brilliant performance by Wagner Moura as Pablo Escobar. He absolutely inhabits the role, making Escobar seem like an average guy, complete with personal mannerisms and traits. Makes for a very engaging and empathetic experience. If it wasn't for the fact that Escobar was a mass-murderer, he might even be likeable... (Interesting fact: Moura is Brazilian and had to learn Spanish for the role. Makes me even more impressed with his performance and work-ethic).

The negative aspect to Seasons 1 and 2 was the character of DEA agent Steve Murphy, played by Boyd Holbrook. He did not seem that an important enough character to be the narrator and essentially central figure of Seasons 1 and 2. Moreover, he is a tad irritating and Holbrook's performance involves talking low and slurred, which is how actors talk nowadays when they want to try to win awards, probably because they think people might mistake them for Marlon Brando.

Pedro Pascal (who might be familiar to Game of Thrones viewers, as he played Oberyn Martell in Season 4) puts in a solid performance as Agent Javier Pena. His character grows in importance as the series progresses and he really steps up as the progression occurs. In Season 3 he takes over narration and does a much better job than Boyd Holbrook.

On that note, I was a bit apprehensive about Season 3. When the Pablo Escobar story ended, I felt that this was a natural end to the series. Everything had been building up to Escobar's demise and by the time it came, I was drained, the build-up of tension was so great. Plus Wagner Moura had made him into such a larger-than-life and engaging character, replacing that character would be difficult.

However, the writers do a great job in Season 3 of maintaining the engagement, through showing several characters, good, bad and neutral, and how the events affect them, plus making the plot development incredibly nail-biting.

Fantastic series."
"There are very few series that deserve to be considered great. This could well be up there.

It's based on the true story of Pablo Escobar. I don't know how accurate it really is, but at the very least it FEELS 100% accurate.

The series hasn't gone down the English with columbian accents route, they have used Spanish with subtitles. For me it just adds to the authenticity of the series! Pablo's part is played effortlessly by the Brazillian actor Wagner Moura. He seems born to play the part! It has gone down the scorsese / goodfellas narrative approach. So if you don't like that style, you will be disappointed! If you are looking for a well researched authentic look into the life and deeds of the most notorious of the columbian drug lords - THIS IS IT! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED! (It get's a 9 because NO series can ever be perfect!)"
"In general, Narcos the series is an underachiever.

My biggest complaint is with the writing. To start, the whole script seems a little too favorable to the DEA. I routinely found myself questioning the prominence of the U.S. characters. At times it felt as if the story had been transcribed from DEA case files rather than actually being ""written"". This results in a sort of ""pseudo documentary"" crime drama. I can imagine the same effect if one very long episode of COPS were made with slightly higher production value. I just don't remember any real investigation or character development in the viewing experience. Just being served a series of events as seen by the DEA.

The casting stuck me as questionable too. Except for the CIA agent, there were no memorable scenes or performances really. I found the portrayal of Pablo to be mostly uninspired or ""matter of fact"" (as most of the other characters). I developed an especially strong distaste for the performance of the DEA agent. THE MOST inappropriate casting choice, I really COULD NOT believe in this character for even one minute of the entire series. I don't know if the actor is a talented fellow or not. I am sure he is NOT suitable for THIS particular part. To be fair, I doubt any actor could overcome the weakness of the script, regardless of how much talent they possess.

So... what I viewed was a series of skewed perspective, filled with cardboard characters. Why has it been been voted so highly? Maybe it can be explained by the fact that Pablo Escobar is one fascinating character, even when he is presented poorly in a series like this one?

Anyway, I know that I'm more interested than ever in Escobar now. I will be seeking out the alternate titles that other reviewers have referenced for us."
"Netflix's new series Narcos is, like its central character, ambitious in scope. It attempts to capture not just the essence of Pablo Escobar (Wagner Moura), a man whose deeds and very existence still loom large in Colombia, but the socio-political landscape of the time, the fear instilled in his enemies and the geo-political effect on North/South American relations in the 1980's. It fails, not because it doesn't try hard enough to achieve the virtually impossible, but because it gets bogged down in tired narrative and muddy history.

Told through the unnecessarily heavy-handed, pulp noir narration of DEA agent Steve Murphy (Boyd Holbrook, whose one-dimensional & totally unsympathetic performance drags the whole production down), Narcos chugs along well enough for a few episodes. It looks very pretty, is superbly designed and its sprawling story leaves you feeling that the team behind it was aiming for a quasi-impressionistic piece, that had to be stitched back together with Murphy's tiresome voice over.

Most disappointingly, too much liberty is taken messing with the actual sequence of events. In the two hour traffic of biopic/historical features, it's understandable that licence is taken with chronology. But in a ten episode season, one should reasonably expect a little more accuracy. Narcos suffers from the needless conceit of placing actual events randomly, rather than staying true to the arc of history as it relates to the rise & fall of the Medellin cartel.

The longer format also lends itself to the development of more sympathetic characters. Sadly, the only character the creators have ladled sympathy on is Moura's well-tempered Escobar.

All that said, should Netflix decide to pick up a second season of Narcos, I'll almost definitely see it through."
"If you're new to family guy, you can start from the beginning and enjoy hundreds of amazing classic episodes, cutaways, and bits. If you're returning family guy fan, there are still mamy new must watch episodes in recent seasons, however half of the modern episodes are uninspired, copy and pasted, and filled with old internet memes because they ran out of 80s references..

Family Guy is a great watch if you want some comedy filler after a long day or to play in the background at a get together.

"This and South Park are shows that master dark comedy and satire.

It is very well written, the jokes are good and land (most of the time).

The voice actors in this show are incredible, the Griffin's voices are iconic and have their moments.

On the other hand, after season 13 it really fell apart, the episodes aren't nearly as funny and are basically the same, they barely make any Brian and Stewie episodes (which are the best episodes).

Unlike South Park, it doesn't get better with age, it isn't as culturally relevant (even when it shouldn't be) and feel boring and painfully unfunny.

Seasons 1-13: great Seasons 14-present: no, just no."
"It's hard for me to rate this show. When looking back at the older seasons it seems to me like Seth and his crew had fun writing and voicing the characters. Occasionally there were musical numbers thrown into the mix, songs I know by heart and will forever be stuck in my head. Such as ""Shipoopi"" and ""It's a wonderful day for pie""

We hardly get any of this nowadays. The gags are nowhere near as complex or funny as they used to be.

Seems to me like the only reason this show is still running is because there is money involved and because some people ( like me ) are naive enough to keep watching even tho it's not what it used to be.

I'm not angry at the state of this show, but it's sad to see what it's been reduced to."
"Family Guy is absolutely, without a doubt, one of the best comedies I've ever seen! It's been on the air for almost 20 years now and it's still just as funny today as it was when it first started, more so in some cases. This is an animated show that's definitely made for adults as some of the humor may not be for children. I would recommend watching the dvd's or steaming it instead of watching it on network tv because you get to hear all swear words and cut out scenes that were too much for network tv. There are just so many great characters on Family Guy that I can't even begin to name them all. This is one of the comedies where you can watch the reruns as many times as you want and it's still hilarious."
"Family Guy is one of the best comedies of all-time. It's about the Griffin family (Peter, Lois, Stewie, Meg and Chris) and their talking dog Brian. I don't even know how to explain how much I absolutely love this show. It has been a laugh out loud funny show for over 20 years now. It's a crude and rude show that says all the things we wish we could say. That's what makes it so funny. It's easily one of my favorite comedies of all-time! Seth McFarlane is just an absolute genius who has done the impossible and that's make a show remain hilarious for over 2 decades now. There's not much I can say about this incredible show that hasn't already been said so just do yourself a favor and go watch it...you won't regret it."
"If you want dark off-the-wall humour that will easily provide consistent yucks, then this is your animated comedy show.

The unworthy dismiss it as primetime lowbrow cutaway filth; this is not a show for them, this is a show for people who love to laugh yet find less and less things to laugh at as time goes on.

The show has strong expression of Jazz and Big Band references solidified through it's theme song, composed and effortlessly reiterated by Walter Murphy. If you're into Jazz music this alone is reason enough to watch.

Despite his modesty in interviews, Seth MacFarlane is a genius and we're going to really miss him when he's gone."
"You have to be able to quickly switch gears between story line, gags and cut-away but its all fun. Quality and content has swayed to and fro from season to season but it continues to put out fun goofy and offbeat humor that can at times be very poignant. There are those that don't care for its type of humor but an interesting coincidence that I have found is that many of those people are watchers of like the the voice and or the walking dead. I find the walking dead aspect to be intriguing because to follow that show you have to be able to suspend belief in reality to accept the pretense of a Zombie apocalypse but then also find comedic gags to be too far out there. Character alliances come and go with episodes and seasons but my favorite is the Stewie and Brian duo. Perhaps the single best aspect of the show are some of the otherwise unrelated cut away gags that poke fun at random aspects or instances in life."
"Family Guy used to be a very good show, with a certain charm to it. Even the cutaways and Brian Griffin were good back then, but as time goes on and on, Family Guy just keeps getting worse and worse. Many of the characters have gone downhill, such as Peter, who used to be hilarious. I would have given this show an 8/10, but the show's newer seasons are pretty bad, so I have to give it a 7/10."
"The series is so hilarious. I love that Peter Griffin got a Fortnite skin and collab. Love the satirical humor it uses.

Peter Griffin's Bird is the Word episode is my fav episode in the series. The emote even got introduced in Fortnite.

I also loved the Blue Harvest because it parodies the OT really cool.

Stewie is also my fav character because of the cool time travel stuff, funny stuff, and he has a 5000 IQ.

I also love that the series was inspired by Simpsons; even had a crossover with both the Griffins and the Simpsons.

I also love Quagmire's Giggity Giggity Goo line because it is so hilarious."
"I cannot even begin to discuss how ridiculously smart and outrageously funny is this show. Not only does this program far surpass most of the comedies on television, it has the guts to hit topics that most of the overly sensitive public shies away from. I never understood why it was taken off the air in the first place. Fox can show something as tawdry and humanly degrading as Temptation Island, but Family Guy was too racy? Riiiight.

I absolutely must comment on the incredible voice talent done for this show, most especially the amazing creator himself, Seth MacFarlane. First of all, his versatility is unlike anything I have ever heard. When I discovered how many voices he actually performed, I was floored. I am currently receiving my masters in speech pathology so I find his ability particularly interesting. Not only can he speak in these individual voices, he can sing in them, and very well I might add.

The musical numbers in this cartoon revive a dying art. The ""Road"" episodes are a hysterical throw back to the Crosby/Hope movies, which is a reference I usually have to explain to my friends though they often must explain a few that I miss. In fact, the scope of the references range from cheesy 80's TV to political commentary to Broadway. This is why everyone will find something funny about this show. Everyone in one form or another can relate to it.

Most of my guy friends think I should be offended by the show because I am a woman and this is a ""guy's show."" Let me tell you, this is not the case at all. Lois Griffin is a freakin role model. I like to think I have half of her savvy when dealing with my ignorant boyfriends.

Absolutely excellent television. Edgy, funny, intelligent and extremely creative. This show was a breath of fresh air for mundane television and will soon awaken the network again. Seth MacFarlane, you are a genius!!"
"In the old day Family Guy had clever jokes, interesting characters and it was well... FUNNY! After like 2011 it was just dull humor that is just there to shock the audience nothing was left of how family guy was. i give it 6 stars because of the old days but i cant give it 9 stars as i would normally because these episodes are an insult to the cartoon medium"
Woah. Family guy has really fallen. Season 19 is by far the worse season I've seen.
"If you never heard of family guy you have definitely been living under a rock cause if you haven't heard of it watch it right next w I can't stress enough about it it's so funny and stupid at the same time but that makes you love it is about Peter griffin his wife Lois and his kids Meg, Chris,, Stewie, and a speaking do h Brian doing random, and stupid things and some how it is funny they have neighbors quagmire, Cleveland, and Joe each of them have an adult show trope quagmire is the sexually obsessed neighbor Cleveland the black guy they make a joke about every episode and joe the person who is handicapped or a person with a disability they also make a joke about every episode it is funny and a must watch."
"I think the writers did a great job on the add-ins with the Kool-Aid ""Oh, yeah"" and the ""Caca for kookoopuffs"". Yet I think that the Father should be given more of a character. I think he should be more defined as a person. He doesn't really stick in my mind that well. Stewie is the greatest. He is the funniest character on television I have seen in years. I think he should be the main star of the show. This show definitely gives the amount of laughs a half hour should give but please don't substitute it for The Simpsons."
"Some streaming services may have modified or added episodes that disturb the numbering sequence.

I am watching on Disney+, and just noticed on Season 6. Here, Episode 1 is Blue Harvest, but on Disney it's Episode 1&2, so that throws the numbering off by 1 until you get to E10, Play It Again Brian, which is on Disney as Episode 11.

Then, Disney has an unlisted Episode 12, 100th Episode Special.

Their Episode 13, Former Life Of Brian is listed here as E11, and their E14, Long John Peter is listed here as 12.

The unlisted Special throws the remaining numbering off by 2.

Season 8 on Disney has Episode 20 & 21 as two parts of the listed E20, Something, Something, Something Dark Side, while the listed E21, Partial Terms of Endearment does not show up on Disney at all.

In Season 9, e1 And Then There Were Fewer is 2 episodes, e7 Road To The North Pole is 2 episodes, e18 It's A Trap is also two episodes, on Disney+ as e20 and e21.

Season 11 on Disney adds yet another special right after e4 Yug Ylimaf.

They have a 200 Episodes Later as e5, throwing of the whole season's numbering by 1.

Season 13, once again adds an Episode number by breaking Episode 1, The Simpsons Guy into two episodes, throwing everything off by 1.

Season 14 & 15 are okay, and that's as far as I've checked so far."
"One of the best sitcoms of all time for the first few seasons but then the show just loses its humour and gets boring with bad, stupid, and and repetitive jokes."
"I absolutely love this show so much. The comedy. The heart. The irony of how spot on it is for the craziness we've seen in politics in recent years and how people can act lol it's amazing. Absolutely amazing. I love all the characters so much. Truly. I adore these people. I have laughed and cried. I'm literally on my 3rd rewatching of the entire series right now. Such quotable lines!! Such iconic scenes!! I cannot speak highly enough of this show. If you haven't watched it, you are truly missing out. It is so so very good! Funny, insightful, and warm. It has definitely become my comfort show, my go to always!!"
"The character development in this show is so fun to watch, great characters and Anne Perkins (Rashida Jones) does not get enough love because she is amazing and I love her, she is my spirit character. Other standouts are Ron, April, Andy, Ben, Chris, Donna, Tom, and never to be missed Jerry/Larry, oh, and Leslie. They are all people we know. It's fun to find these people in our everyday lives. The antics are sometimes over the top, but this is satire and that should be expected... and it's hilarious. The most important thing is relatable characters who are wholesome and lovable, and true to themselves. This show delivers. It will be repeat binged often."
"One of the show's standout qualities is its exceptional character development. Each character is uniquely crafted, and the chemistry among the ensemble cast is palpable. Leslie Knope's unwavering enthusiasm, Ron Swanson's deadpan humor, April Ludgate's sarcasm, and Andy Dwyer's lovable goofiness create a blend of personalities that consistently entertain and endear viewers.

The writing is sharp, clever, and often politically relevant. ""Parks and Recreation"" adeptly mixes witty humor with heartwarming moments. The show's ability to address real-life issues within the framework of a comedy series is commendable. The humor ranges from clever wordplay to absurd situations, all delivered with impeccable timing by the talented cast.

As the series progresses, the characters undergo substantial growth and development. Their personal and professional journeys, relationships, and ambitions are portrayed with depth and authenticity, making them incredibly relatable and allowing the audience to emotionally invest in their lives.

Beyond the laughs, ""Parks and Recreation"" subtly tackles social and political issues, celebrating the power of community and the importance of civic engagement. The show's heart lies in its portrayal of the characters' unwavering dedication to their town and the genuine friendships formed amidst the chaos of local governance.

With its memorable catchphrases, iconic characters, and enduring positivity, ""Parks and Recreation"" has left a lasting impact on popular culture. Its optimistic outlook, coupled with its ability to blend humor with meaningful storytelling, ensures its place among the most beloved sitcoms of all time ( except for the last few episodes of the last season)"
"Parks and Recreation is absolutely, without a doubt, one of the best comedies ever created! I never really watched it when it was originally on but heard such great things about it through the years that I thought I'd give it a chance and I was absolutely blown away by how funny it was! The first season wasn't as good because the show was still trying to find itself so don't judge it by that, you could actually just skip the entire first season, but from then on every season is great. Also, the cast is terrific. Every single character on the show will make you laugh out loud and are funny enough to have their own spin-off. I promise you that you will not regret watching this hilarious show."
"I watched this weekly when it originally aired. The hard part was waiting a week haha. Years later I streamed every episode again and think I enjoyed it even more. As I write this review it's on my TV. I don't ever watch regular TV...commercials suck. But whenever I find this playing in the background I always stop and watch some. So this time I decided to leave a review. You Need to get through the first couple episodes, because I swear it just gets batter and better. Those aren't the strongest episodes so beat with it. The storylines are always interesting and fun. They add soooo many amazing people throughout the years. Wether a cameo or years long additions. Some recurring roles here and there through the series and they do not disappoint! It's easy to watch, the characters are so much fun and man can they make me laugh! I hope I'll always be able to find this show because it can always bring a smile to my face. They just don't make shows like this anymore. The simple fact there's no laugh track!!!! If you haven't watched it in it's entirety you should. It really is great."
"I verified this show aired its Series Finale on February 24, 2015. I never watched a single minute of the show prior to the summer of 2019. I had stumbled upon a compilation video of Aubrey Plaza's awkward interviews when she did guest appearances on various talk shows. I found her entertaining enough that I came here to verify everything she had starred in. I had seen at least 3 things before that she starred in, but Parks and Rec was one show I never even considered watching because the title sounded boring to me.

The full cast list piqued my interest and verified the whole series was on Netflix at that time. So I gave it a shot and I was so happy that I did. Binged all 7 season is less than 2 weeks. I've watched the entire series in correct episode order twice. I eventually subscribed and maintain a Peacock subscription for Parks and Rec and The Office. Both of those shows are great to just throw on a random episode at any given point of your week to brighten your day.

Aubrey's character April Ludgate still remains supreme and is my favorite character. But there are multiple characters tied for a close 2nd. I'm sure some of the topics and jokes are going to trigger some people or set off their cringe detector. To which I would just encourage you to lighten up and free yourself from the 2nd hand embarrassment. It is OK to laugh at a joke even if the topic has become more controversial.

Laughing at someone else's absurd observation does not mean you are guilty of that observation. I just love the variety of characters and how well their personalities both clash with and compliment each other. Many of the actors here deliver their greatest performance that will be cherished for decades."
"Parks and Recreation has a very rough start, and the first seasons requires some determination to get really in to, but when you get trough the first seasons, you will never want to stop again. The show is full of likeable characters, with great development trough out the show, and the humor is just spot on. The middle seasons are especially great, with some of the funniest episodes in television history.

If you like shows like the office you will certainly love this gem. So please just fight trough what might not be the perfect beginning, because you will without doubt love what comes after."
"Big fan of Amy Poehler ever since she played Andy Richter's pigtailed, dental-retainered little sister (with the huge crush on Conan!) on Conan O'Brien's late night show. That first appearance is still the most amazing performance I've ever seen on TV. The addled but adorable Leslie Knope is the absolutely IDEAL character for Amy to play! I'm also thrilled to see Rashida Jones, another of my favorite super-talents, doing a thoroughly delicious characterization as Ann Perkins. Word was that the network was worried about the similarity to The Office. What's to worry? Two genius shows just might be better than one!!! The writing on this show is breathtakingly original and deeply enjoyable. You won't find a better cast anywhere on Earth. This is just another case of ""a perfect storm"" of comedy excellence on NBC -- along with The Office and 30 Rock. It's well known that the best TV comedy derives from complex, fascinating characters. Along with the creators and scribes of those other two shows, these writers are the absolute best at devising characters that are equally lovable and horrifying -- you can totally revel in their triumphs AND their tragedies!"
"Have to admit when I first started watching Parks and Rec I thought immediately of The Office but after a few episodes it developed it's own personality and quirkiness. All characters are hilarious and loveable in their own way, with one very notable exception. Craig, who joins the cast in season 5 (I think) is an annoying pointless addition and offers nothing to the show. He is essentially the DeAngelo (The Office) of this show. He is loud, obnoxious and grating on the soul. Everybother character brings something including the supporting cast and characters including John Ralphio, who also initially is hard to handle but will gradually grow on you. Craig cost them a point otherwise they'd be ten. I hate you Craig."
"This show is absolutely magnificent, the jokes, the characters, the dialogue, the relationships, everything is just spot-on. Ron Swanson is one of the greatest characters seen on television and his character development throughout the 7 seasons makes you love him even more. But all the characters are impeccable and unique, Andy, April, Leslie, Ben, Chris, Tom, Ann, Donna and Jerry are all great, even the minor reoccurring characters like Jamm and Jennifer are spectacular. The story is really great and you find yourself rooting for Leslie and what she does for the entirety of the show. However there are 2 minor problems with this show: The first season and Mark. The first season of this show isn't amazing, the characters seem quite reminiscent of characters in The Office and lack originality, some even lack likability. As for Mark, he is simply just a dull and quite boring character, he has his moments, but when he is replaced by Chris and Ben at the end of Season 2 the show gets infinitely better. Bottom line, I would 100% recommend this show, you just have to wait a little for it to get good."
"In my opinion the best comedy to ever exist over the face of the earth. Even better than the Big Bang Theory or the Office. Never jumped the shark, never got cheesy, never had a moment where we said oh c'mon you are exaggerating! Whenever I feel at the lowest point in my life, I watch this show and I start smiling. This show is soo crazily funny but it is much more than that. It has life lessons, it has super realistic and inspirational characters and super acting. I mean how can a show achieve all of this? Thank you so much to all the creators, writers, directors, crew, and the actors! Next generations will also watch this show I am so sure of that."
"As a huge fan of Parks and Rec, it makes me upset when people talk about how it is not near as good as The Office. Parks and Rec is obviously going to be very similar to The Office because it's literally run and written by the creators of the American version of The Office. Even though it is similar, it takes a slightly different approach to the comedy. It uses very dry humor with great casting, acting, and writing. This is one of the best casts that could have been thrown together and the characters they play are amazing. Ron Swanson and Andy Dwyer are two of the best characters that have been in any TV show. While it has its dull moments and bad episodes, it is a show that is hard not to find enjoyable throughout."
"What started out as a rather bad spin-off of The Office quickly became one of the best sitcoms every release. The characters, which a lot of the comedy derived from, are so hilarious. Each one has a distinct personality that really adds to the show. If you want to watch this show, suffer through Season 1, then get through Season 2 (with that insufferable Mark guy) and then it will be worth it. My personal favorite character is Rob Lowe as Chris Traeger... It's too bad he was only around for three seasons.

Favorite episode: Season 3, Episode 16: Lil' Sebastian S1: 6/10 (Very bad) S2: 8/10 (Getting pretty good) S3: 9/10 (Amazing) S4: 9/10 S5: 9/10 S6: 8/10 (Chris Traeger left) S7: 9/10 (Very emotional)"
"If you live in the Midwest, you'll totally understand this TV show, or really if you live anywhere boring in the world you'll understand this TV show.

The struggle to make a boring place interesting exciting, etc. From the people in charge.

And that could go for somewhere in the middle of California to some small boring borough in New York City.

The hilarity of, and also the fascination of small town government to inject some fascinating interesting thing into their political spectrum and municipal building front lawns, just to make whoever happens stance visit that area stop and wonder; to think and ponder the meaning of their existence based on some factoid of info from that area that has a larger connection to the world at large.

Just a little tablespoon of spice to their life, making the small residents feel a little bit better about themselves and the world that they live in.

Once they feel better, they then can gush about how much cheaper prices are where they reside, and how much longer their driveways and yards are and larger their homes are, than the rich people in New York City AND Los Angeles AND Eagleton!

When small towns label their main attraction ""Parks and Recreation"" it's not really a flex. Recreation usually meaning boating, fishing, and swimming. And then some weird extracurricular activities.

But upon further investigation, Parks and Recreation helps you realize that in those parks and recreation events and settings, people will do wonderful things. And ""freedom"" counts for something."
"PARKS AND RECREATION (2009-2015) is a political comedy, mockumentary series. It follows the shenanigans of the Parks and Recreational town officers of Indiana's small town, Pawnee. I initially watched this to help me out of a bad post-Office bender withdrawal phase (along with Modern Family, Arrested Development, Community etc.) This one helped the most and the characters really grew on me.

""The absurd antics of an Indiana town's public officials as they pursue sundry projects to make their city a better place.""

Overall, this series was super hilarious. This series stars the funny Amy Poehler as Leslie Knope, and the brilliant Nick Offerman as Ron Swanson and a plethora of other hilarious and likable characters. Chris Pratt as Andy Dwyer is another great character! A great watch! Give Parks & Rec a chance!"
"Parks and Recreation is set in the fictional town of Pawnee, a medium-sized city in the US state of Indiana. Pawnee is known throughout the United States for being shaped by numerous economic and social problems. For example, it is the fourth largest city in the United States with the highest rate of obesity. In mockumentary style, Parks and Recreation accompanies the employees of the Pawnee Parks Department. This office is responsible for the establishment and maintenance of Pawnee's parks and recreational facilities. The Parks Bureau is chaired by Ron Swanson, who has to argue with his deputy director Leslie Knope on a daily basis.

""Parks and Recreation"" isn't nearly as good as ""The Office"", but it's also a very good and funny creation by the creator of both series."
"This show is quite the mixed bag. It has some great comedic moments. But It also has some of the most boring, nonsensical content I have ever seen. Season one was so bad I almost didn't continue on after. But seasons 2 - 5 were pretty funny. The show reached is peak around season 5. 6 was definitely not great. I may give season 7 a try but I am finding it difficult to stay interested. If you want to give this show a try, I would suggest skipping season one completely. You are better off watching best of compilations on YouTube so you can skip through the dry nonsense. Also I don't know who told Aziz he was funny, but they lied to him. He is literally the worst part of the show. I found myself fast forwarding through his screen time pretty often. Especially the rent a swag and Entertainment 720 storylines. His ""business partner"" Jean-Ralphio may be the most annoying person on the planet."
"I was hesitant to give this the rating I did, but from reading other audience reviews, my review actually will come across as far more... lenient. What can I say that hasn't been said already, the golden age of The Simpsons (seasons 3-8) is flawless television. Going through it again, it was awe inspiring to me how they manage to structure joke upon joke upon joke upon joke, something that must've been a complete breath of fresh air considering the boring, lifeless, milk-toast excuses for comedy shows that were coming around at that time. Yeah, those ones using canned laughter which relied completely on actors and people being loud as an excuse to be funny with a roaring laughter every 5 seconds spoon feeding the audience of when to laugh, with an exception of Seinfeld these were just boring shows for boring people, The Simpsons was intelligent, heart felt, structured and most of all... FUNNY.

However, all good things must come to an end. In an ideal scenario, The Simpsons ended on season 10 and season 9 didn't include the infamous 'The Principal and The Pauper', it lives its legacy as one of the greatest TV shows of all time and is passed down from generation to generation. Sure, the season 9 and 10 weren't golden age material, they were still solid entries in The Simpsons canon but then from season 11, things started to drastically change, we were getting episodes which would've been some of the weaker episodes in a golden age era season that were the best episodes of the season they were actually in. Sure, season 13 was pretty good but the show was tanking in quality almost directly after, pretty much season 14 onwards was terrible (not to mention the really bland movie). Now we're on the 31st season, the show is just completely unwatchable, the best episodes are mediocre and boring and the worst episodes are... 'Lisa Goes Gaga' (if you know what I mean). The show, at this point, is almost completely unrecognisable, a mere slight resemblance of what it once was (even the animation sucks nowadays), that's why it's so damn difficult to rate this show, at the same time it's one of my favourite and least favourite shows, the show should've ended 20 years ago, you can't keep lightning in a bottle for that long, it's not a show that is relevant to today's cultural landscape, it would be so much more respected if it had ended on its 10th season. That's why I can't in good conscience rate this show the 9 or 10/10 that I want to... but the only reason I'm giving it a 7 over a 5 is because even though there is more bad than good of The Simpsons (more signals for it to just end), the golden age is some of the best television to have ever been constructed and cannot be ignored.





Here's how I'd rate the seasons: Season 1 - 8/10 Season 2 - 8/10 Season 3 - 9/10 Season 4 - 9/10 Season 5 - 10/10 Season 6 - 10/10 (best season) Season 7 - 9/10 Season 8 - 8/10 Season 9 - 8/10 Season 10 - 7/10 Season 11 - 6/10 Season 12 - 6/10 Season 13 - 7/10 Season 14 - 5/10 Season 15 - 4/10 Season 16 - 5/10 Season 17 - 4/10 Season 18 - 4/10 Season 19 - 4/10 Season 20 - 6/10 Season 21 onward - 2/10"
"No one, not even Matt Groening himself, could've imagined that The Simpsons would become as big as it did. Nor could anyone anticipate it could become so cultural. ""D'oh"" is in the dictionary, and it has spawned off several catch-phrases and one liners. Truly, The Simpsons is the biggest thing since Seinfeld! The first three seasons showed them as if they were an actual family. Like the kind of family you'd meet on the street (only a lot more dysfunctional). Homer trying to do the fatherly thing in each episode. Marge being the voice of reason all the time. Lisa and Bart with their sibling rivalry. These first three seasons are not usually sighted as being the best, but they are often brought up when one speaks of ""The Best Episode Ever!"" By Season four, the show took a turn for what may have been the best. It left it's more realistic roots and became more of a satire. With more zany antics and more clever, witty, and often times sophisticated humor, The Simpsons became the most popular family on television. Each episode still contained it's own merits, themes and messages. Seasons 4 to about 10 are often said to be the ""Golden Age"" of The Simpsons.

However, as the year 2000 came, fans began to see themselves divided. Those who stuck with the show since it came about in 1989 were quick to jump on how the show changed. The humor became more lurid and toilet like, with antics becoming heavily more unrealistic and zany (to the point where some even say it isn't funny... but stupid). Some characters becoming unrealistically stupid, and the show shifting gears from focusing on Bart to Homer... to everyone outside of the Simpson family. The show also began to see more cumbersome and meaningless plots. Plots that didn't focus on current issues, or that didn't seem to be as strong as older episodes. Despite this, new fans seem to have come about to replace then, and the show continues to remain at the top of its game, even today.

I'm sure you all know where I stand on that debate. Nine stars to nine fantastic seasons."
"When I was 10, I adored the Simpsons, America's favourite dysfunctional family. Me and my brother and sisters watched it every day after school, and got a bagful of laughs. Two years ago though, I stopped watching it. Maybe I didn't find it as funny, creative or as original anymore. Well after seeing the Simpsons Movie, I decided to give the show another chance. And I am glad I did, because it is smart, creative, funny AND original. It is true that the show has been declining in written quality the past three years or so, but the more recent seasons are still watchable, thanks to the animation and the endearing characters.

The show's animation is fantastic. In animated shows, I like animation that is colourful and fluid, and the animation in this show is exactly that. The theme tune is irresistibly catchy and the story lines are outstandingly good. Other than the voice acting what made the show so good was its writing. Not obnoxious or childish, but smart and most importantly funny. And the visual jokes are also impressive.

And the voice acting is exceptional bringing the dysfunctional family to life. Homer is a type of father figure who repeatedly lets down his family, has a love for doughnuts and beer and pretty much hates his job. Dan Castallenetta, a talented voice actor whom I fondly remember as Megavolt from Darkwing Duck, does a great job not only as Homer but as Grandpa and Krusty, not loud and abrasive at all but just right. Julie Kavner is also great as Marge, a caring matriarch who genuinely cares for her family. Nancy Cartwright is perfect as Bart, who is quite naughty and hates school, same with Yeardley Smith as studious Lisa. Plus Maggie is absolutely adorable.

Then there are the supporting characters. My favourite is Grandpa, he is absolutely hilarious. Hank Azaria is amusing as Moe and Chief Wiggum, and Harry Shearer is suitably chirpy as Ned and impresses equally with his monotonic drawls for Principal Skinner and Reverend Lovejoy. There are many memorable guest performances from various celebrities, and frequent appearances from Phil Hartmann and Tress MacNeille. My favourite is Kelsey Grammar as Sideshow Bob, a reprising villain I enjoy watching, sinister yet funny. All in all, despite the fact it isn't as enjoyable as it was, The Simpsons is still a great show. 9.5/10 Bethany Cox"
"Brilliant television series that could probably be best described as ""The Flintstones"" gone stark-raving mad. ""The Simpsons"", everyone knows them. Some love the series and some could care less about it. Love it or hate it, it is near impossible to criticize the intelligence and creativity of this series. The titled animated family makes their home in Springfield, USA and gets into situations that are seemingly more outlandish and crazier than the previous adventure. Homer, Marge, Bart, Lisa, and Maggie are still going strong after nearly a dozen years of television life and with each passing moment it seems that the series sets some new precedent. For several years the show seemed to be the only attraction to the then obscure Fox Network. It was the first primetime animated show that was treated like a sitcom since ""The Flintstones"" quietly left the air in 1966. Many people feared the series when it first premiered in 1989 because they felt that it was hardcore adult material in a candied form that would appeal to younger audiences. Well for the most part this was true. However, ""The Simpsons"" would prove to be much more for all audiences. The great thing about the series is that it caters to all audiences. True there are usually situations that may not be suitable for all viewers, but then again that is true with everything on television this side of Disney Land and Sesame Street. ""The Simpsons"" works because of great comedy of course, but also great lessons that can be taken from most of the episodes. The people within the program may be animated, but they are just as complicated and vulnerable as the people watching them. All the regulars have their quirks, but in some episodes you can understand what certain characters are going through because the show is so life-like at times. Former President George Bush (the one from 1988-1992) once made a statement that families should be more like ""The Waltons"" and less like ""The Simpsons"". His opinion is somewhat old-fashioned and unrealistic. In other words, many topics dealt with in ""The Simpsons"" fit life for people in the 1990s and 2000s better than ""The Waltons"" did in the 1970s. A crowning achievement in television art. 5 stars out of 5."
"This is a classic show but only the first 20 season are worth watching I mean after they were bought by Disney they went down hill.

It's great and funny the first 20 seasons and then it just gets tiring and the humor is more for kids and family."
"What can I say about the Simpsons? Initially, let's start with the positives. Has there ever quite been a show like the Simpsons? I think not! Matt Groening and James L. Brooks have truly created something of great comical and philosophical magnitude. From seasons 1-13 (that's right, up to season 13!), comedy appropriate to the society was cleverly exploited, causing the Simpsons to become a global phenomenon for obvious reasons. Flaws in society were excavated; puns were dished out with a clean edge and, most profoundly, this was a cartoon that both enticed adults and children alike (paving the way for successful cartoons such as Family Guy and South Park; although neither would reach the success of The Simpsons). Now the negatives. From seasons 14-19, Simpsons episodes were mediocre, shamelessly brandishing celebrities left, right and centre and dishing out jokes that seemed force and less natural. The series still did have the spark that peaked interest and tickled the funny bone but, other than that, it was rather a disappointment. This, however, was nothing compared to the decline in quality from seasons 20-26! Story lines seemed to consist of depression in the Simpson household and offered little to no comedic value. In addition, celebrities not only made cameo appearances, but dominated episodes in which the plot was clearly strained and offered nothing (especially the disgusting 'Lisa goes Gaga' which seems to combine all of my points beautifully). The writers have quite literally lost the plot and the show really should be cancelled! It is hard to tell whether the show has become a sentimental attachment to Mr Groening or whether FOX are just too worried about losing money at the cancelling of this show. Whatever the reason, FOX or Matt Groening need to end this show so it can leave the spotlight retaining dignity and fond memories; otherwise, we may look back at the early episodes as a distant memory! I rate The Simpsons as a 10 simply because of its earlier brilliance and my loyalty: a testament to its early episodes!"
"I have to start off by saying that seasons 1-9 of the Simpsons were absolutely fantastic, easily some of the best television i have ever seen. the writing was sharp and witty, the characters unpredictable and to some degree you could relate to them. I don't think anyone can deny that the Simpsons is probably the most famous TV show ever. even people who don't watch the show have heard about it or can name a few of the characters whether it be Homer, Bart or Marge, THAT IS HOW POWERFUL THIS SHOW HAS BECOME. After all the success of the TV show it was inevitable that eventually a movie would be made, but to talk about the movie would be starting a completely different review all together, so i won't get into that.

Now you might have wondering why i have got ""Awkward feelings"" as my summary, well thats exactly what i get when i watch the more recent episodes. i feel awkward and pretty upset to be honest, at just how bad the newer episodes are. they are over the top, pointless and predictable. in the first 9 seasons each episode had a subtle moral whether it be about stealing , drugs or other things, but when watching the latest ones i just get the feeling they make them just for the money factor, without actually giving a Sh*t about how they are ruining the memories most hardcore fans have of when the show was the best thing on television. It has gone on far too long , and i know i am in the majority when i say that this show is slowly starting to leave a bad taste in mouths of the fans. They should just end the show now whilst its still ""decent"" , in the 400+ episodes that exist, you would think they have told all the stories they wanted about the family, but no they keep coming up with stupid stories that make no sense, which we have already seen similar ones to in the older episodes.

As much as i cannot stand the last 5 or six seasons , ill still have to give this show 10/10 , because of the first 9 or so seasons, That is how highly i think of them.

By Scott Dewhurst"
"Animated Film or ""Cartoons' have long been part of the motion world. Their magical movement and ""life"" has been the instrument of so much laughter, tears and all round amazement, tons of it. From HUMOROUS PHASES OF FUNNY FACES (Vitagraph Co., 1906) right down through the heyday of ROGER RABBIT(1988) and beyond, the animated film has been there providing us with an alternate film Universe; another dream world for other dreams.

For the longest time, the animated ""Cartoon"" has been branded by some as being strictly (non-greasy) ""Kids' Stuff."" That rap's being hung on them doubtless dates from the early days of commercial Telecasts in the late 1940's and early 1950's, when so many local Stations broadcast Noontime, late Afternoon and Saturday Morning programming aimed at Children. Beyond their assortment of various ""Aunts"", ""Uncles"", Cowboys, Clowns and Puppets of varying ilk; they had to fill out their on air time. But with what would they do, what could be used to fill up the shows? As a diversion from the live action, the Stations made use of what ever short films that could be purchased, rented or leased for a price within their budgets. The films available fell into 2 basic types. The first group featured the likes of Snub Pollard, Harry Langdon, Our Gang, Mickey (Himself) McGuire, The 3 Tons of Fun Harry Langdon, the Keystone Kops and Charlie Chase. These were live action silent comedies.

The second group was made up of old silent and early sound animated short subjects. Their sources were many and varied. There were silent with sound track added; containing music, sound effects and occasional words. Paul Terry's Farmer Al Falfa was much in evidence; as were productions of the then defunct Van Beueren Studios. Those cartoons were those featuring ""Cubby Bear"" and ""a human Mutt and Jeff team of ""Tom And Jerry"", not the MGM Cat & Mouse team. And of course, there were many others; a lot of them released to Television by 'Official Films' (as opposed to any Un-Official Films that may be lying about.) Eventually of course, in God's good time, original TV Cartoons were produced. Those such as Alexander Anderson & Jay Ward's CRUSADER RABBIT. Hanna-Barbera's RUFF & REDDY, HUCKLEBERRY HOUND, YOGI BEAR, etc. and Terrytoons' TOM TERRIFIC, DEPUTY DAWG and others did make it out to our living rooms via the Networks. These were mainly done for the kids. (Although, once again, any Jay Ward Production has an appeal to all ages.) And that brings us down the Video Evolutionary Track to THE SIMPSONS. Now, even though animated, even the most vehemently anti-cartoon old grouch would have to concede the point to us that this is not just child's fare.

In short, THE SIMPSONS is the story of a totally dysfunctional American Family; being representative of the typical family. The 5 Simpsons are the Homer (father), Marge (Mother), Bart (Son & Star), Lisa (Sister) and Maggie (Infant Sister). Together with their various and sundry pets, neighbors, friends and co-workers have an incredibly high number of adventures, which can be and are limitless in scope and locale. From week to week it isn't uncommon to see either Homer or Marge taking to a new profession or running for public office. Their home town of Springfield has an everyman's geological set up; being bordered by mountains, forests, desserts, rivers, canyons and whatever else the particular story requires. In short, it is boundless and all encompassing. It is a town that is as vast or as deep as imagination, itself.

There are some who criticize the characterization of Homer as an uncouth, swill slugging vulgarian. Their line of reasoning being that a poor example of American Family and an even poorer example of a fictional Father figure than was Carroll O'Connor's 'Archie Bunker.' To those critics, we can only say that they should take time and carefully watch and even more meticulously listen to the damn thing! Even though it may appear on the surface that the admittedly dysfunctional (to say the least) family would be a poor example to put on exhibit, albeit a comic version of one.

If one stops to take inventory of the individual episodes, their themes and presentations, they'd certainly see things far differently. For believe it or not, the Simpsons present us with a fine example of an American Family, as viewed through the multi lensed spectrum Of a comedy series that, even though it's a ""Cartoon"", has a lot to say. For underneath it all, with all the gags, funny business and wacky plots; we find some very decent, ""old fashioned"" and important virtues that we would do well in remembering.

As just one example, an important one is the down to earth relationship between Mr. and Mrs. Simpson, Marge and Homer. No matter how wacky the plot or how far aground the story takes the Family Simpson, in the end we see how much they really do love each other and are always there when their mate needs the other.

Honest folks, just try it for yourselves, soon!"
"No cartoon - and even dare I say, tv show - has had such a profound impact on the zeitgeist. Pretty much everyone knows The Simpsons, regardless of their demographic. There have been many copycats (Family Guy) that have tried to steal some of the thunder and appeal, but none have come close.

The Simpsons excels on every front - or at least did, which I'll get into soon.

The characters are all likable and unique. The storylines are original and interesting. The writing is incisive, snappy and witty. What's not to like? That is before the seasons entered into the high double digits.

There is a noticeable decline in quality as the series progresses, but it manages to hang on to its brilliance for many, many years - a task which is no easy feat.

To me, The Simpsons struggled mightily to adapt to the rapidly changing millennium and focused too hard on inserting the latest lazy pop culture reference, such as ""Mapple"" (in response to the emergent Apple), and so on and so on. The Simpsons also, from what I've heard, suffered from shuffling of writers, which greatly detracted from the overall quality and tonality of the material.

The Simpsons is still by far the best tv show ever made and will in all likelihood retain that designation for the foreseeable future.

Seasons 1-10 are untouchable comedic gold. Not a single episode misses the mark."
"OK so many say that this show is slowing loosing it's luster. I beg to differ slightly. Family Guy seems to be the ""in thing"" right now and though I love that show as well, The Simpsons is still the hierarchy or animated television. This show can be enjoyed by all races, religions, and ethnicities alike. It's not as racy as the aforementioned competition but still just as (if not more) funny. Things do tend to wear over time and people's likes/dislikes tend to change. I've enjoyed every episode from the first one up until the current ones. The competition does touch topics that, if this show would touch, it would be kind of tasteless. I'll be a fan up until the last and final episode. Nothing has really changed except for people's opinions. Along with Seinfeld, Martin, and Married With Children, The Simpsons is and always will be a most noteworthy sitcom in t.v. history. That is All!!!"
"Removing MJ episode , But not Clinton ? Removing Apu? I mean, has The world gone crazy? Everyone is offensiv today .. and censoring humor . Yeah way to go."
"Why can't you just end the show? You ruin it year after year and it's worse since Disney took over. Please just end it already, you already made your landmakr. What more do you want?"
"What more can I possibly say about a TV show that has already been praised to death? I was 15 when the Simpsons first aired and I'm 25 now. I've seen every single episode, and I'd have to say it's a rare combination of factors that come together to make The Simpsons the best show ever.

It's a very clever and intelligent show - they never dumb anything down - and as creator Matt Groening has remarked, ""The Simpsons is a show that rewards paying attention."" There are always enough obscure pop-culture references or subtle background gags to ensure that the second, third, or tenth viewing of an episode will find you noticing something you hadn't before.

In the early days of The Simpsons, they derived a large part of their popularity from the everyday, down-to-earth, unglamorous, average-blue-collar-slob aspect of the Simpson family. Homer is lazy and doesn't like his job, Bart doesn't excel at school, the plastic ketchup bottle they use at the dinner table makes that farting sound, and so on. This aspect of the program contrasts it with popular 80's family sitcoms such as The Cosby Show which always featured impossibly well-functioning families who got along a little too perfectly and usually learned a neat little lesson at the end of each episode. An early tag-line for The Simpsons said that they ""put the Fun back in Dysfunctional.""

Perhaps this blue-collar-slobness by itself is nothing shockingly original - think of previous TV shows such as Roseanne, Married with Children, All in the Family, The Honeymooners - but the Simpsons doesn't stop there. This show is extremely densely packed with jokes - everything from cerebral witticisms and sly satire to Homer falling down and going ""D'oh!"" Because it's a cartoon, the writers can get away with surreal gags such as the time Homer tells a joke which falls flat, after which a long silence happens which is punctuated by a single tumbleweed rolling through the Simpson's living room.

There are just too many things to mention about The Simpsons. It can be touching occasionally; more often the viewers are treated to an unequalled cavalcade of obscure references, surreal sight gags, wacky adventures, self-mocking irony... The list goes on and on. Just watch it, else you're missing out on one of the most important elements of 1990's popular culture."
"The simpsons were the best for the first 12 seasons but a decline each season from 4 to 12. By season 13 to today are terrible. The plots do not make sense and there are some differences with the simpsons.

Homer is stupid but he was hilarious. Now he is a dimwit that is just plain stupid. Marge is more boring each season, Bart is an Alcohoic how funny. Lisa is so annoying about being so smart. Maggie is still the same from the start. I really think this show will not last long due to the boring episodes they had and the low ratings they have. For some reason the intro are more interesting than the whole episode I just don't get why they are doing that. The simpsons is having the same fate as spongebob with some great seasons at first but turn to trash.

First 12 13/10

13 to recent 3/10

The only hope for the simpsons to be great again is that the simpsons family guy special is good and the rest of season 26 to more than just par."
"The Simpsons is an animated American sitcom created by Matt Groening for the Fox Broadcasting Company. It is a satirical parody of the ""Middle American"" lifestyle epitomised by its title family, which consists of Homer, Marge, Bart, Lisa, and Maggie. The show is set in the fictional town of Springfield, and lampoons many aspects of the human condition, as well as American culture, society as a whole, and television itself.

The family was conceived by Groening shortly before a pitch for a series of animated shorts with the producer James L. Brooks. Groening sketched an outline version of a dysfunctional family, and named the characters after members of his own family, substituting Bart for his own name. The shorts became a part of The Tracey Ullman Show on April 19, 1987. After a three-season run, the sketch was developed into a half-hour prime time show.

The Simpsons was an early hit for Fox, and won several major awards. Time magazine's December 31, 1999 issue named it the 20th century's best television series, and on January 14, 2000 it was awarded a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. The Simpsons is currently the longest-running American sitcom, and the longest-running American animated program. Homer's annoyed grunt ""D'oh!"" has been adopted into the English lexicon, while The Simpsons has been cited as an influence on many adult-oriented animated sitcoms."
"The Simpsons is truly a one of a kind show. On one hand, it can be educational. I don't think one episode of the Simpsons goes by where there isn't a reference to someone or something that kids would definitely not know. There, they learn something if they catch it. On the other hand, you have your comedy. Of course, the comedy and the Simpsons comedy is favored among more. Why is the comedy material funny? Randomness. The Simpsons is very random and that's what sets it apart drastically from the others such as Futurama and King of the Hill. However, this is taking the easy way out, as randomness has to do about things that don't a have to do with anything. In my opinion, it's cheating. I can't wait till the movie comes out"
"The Simpson's is with out a doubt the greatest comedy to come out of America,

it has covered everything, from everyday life, endless special guests. to parody's of famous movies. but now 16 years on and many laughs later the Simpson's has become a house hold name. But now i think the creators are running out of ideas, the jokes from the new episodes are going from classic to desperate and kind of dumb i think they should get the movie over with and then finally close the book of the greatest piece of animated comedy.

Over all the best ever. but unfortunately all great things must come to an end and i think the time is near."
"This show may have gone downhill significantly over the years, but we have to remember how amazing it once was! After being introduced in animated shorts on ""The Tracey Ullman Show"" in 1987, the Simpson family started out in their own show late in 1989, with a Chrismas special. The first season continued in 1990, and during the show's early days, it was controversial. At that point in time, it seems that society wasn't used to cartoon shows not being 100% kid-friendly. However, ""The Simpsons"" also turned out to be one groundbreaking series of the decade, and the controversy eventually died down (less kid-friendly cartoon shows have come since)!

The Simpsons are a dysfunctional American family who live in the city of Springfield. The parents are Homer (an overweight, lazy, aggressive simpleton who works at the local nuclear power plant) and Marge (usually a stay-at-home mother who tries her best to keep the rest of the family in line). The kids are Bart (a ten-year-old boy who very often gets in trouble, and doesn't usually do so well at school), Lisa (a very intelligent, gifted eight-year-old girl who plays the saxophone and usually does very well at school, but often has trouble with her social life), and Maggie (the youngest in the family, only a baby). The family owns two pets, a dog named Santa's Little Helper and a cat named Snowball. Various kinds of trouble for this family often arise, including Marge and Homer having trouble with their relationship, Bart or Lisa experiencing a problem at school, and so many other things! Wherever the Simpsons go, trouble seems to await!

The show has many excellent supporting characters, probably more than most shows do! They include Krusty the Clown (a wacky clown whose #1 fan is probably Bart), Mr. Burns (Homer's evil 104-year-old boss at the power plant), Waylon Smithers (Burns' assistant), the Flanders' (the Christian fundamentalist family who live next door to the Simpsons), Seymour Skinner (the principal of Springfield Elementary who is middle-aged and still lives with his mother), Agnes Skinner (Seymour's bossy mother), Apu Nahasapeemapetilon (a man from India who runs the local Kwik-E-Mart), Edna Krabappel (Bart's teacher, who often gives him trouble), Abraham J. ""Grampa"" Simpson (Homer's silly father, who lives at a retirement home and has a lot of history), Patty and Selma Bouvier (Marge's nasty, chain-smoking sisters, who hate Homer), Moe Szyslak (a local bartender who is easily fooled by Bart's crank calls), Barney Gumble (Homer's alcoholic friend who is usually only seen at Moe's), Lenny and Carl (two more of Homer's friends, who drink at Moe's with him and work at the power plant), Milhouse Van Houten (Bart's nerdy friend)...the list goes on!

Aside from all the funny characters, ""The Simpsons"" has several other notable features, including lots of brilliant humour, excellent writing, social commentary, a lot of voice talent (most of the cast members provide the voices of several characters), impressive animation (even if the main characters are simply drawn), etc.! The Halloween episodes are a highlight as well, each featuring three short stories, which are generally less realistic than the plots for most regular episodes. There's really not much (if anything) to be said about the long-running, groundbreaking series that hasn't already been said many times, so I'm basically just repeating things that others have mentioned!

It has now been nearly eighteen years since ""The Simpsons"" started out in full episodes, and it currently holds the record for the longest-running cartoon show! Unfortunately, but unsurprisingly, it hasn't been the same in recent years, gradually declining in quality. Personally, I can't stand watching new episodes. I certainly don't think they're horrendous, but they seem very stale, and certainly can't compare to the classics, making me feel as if I've lost something in my life. I know I'm certainly not the only fan who avoids new episodes, many others believe that it should have come to an end long ago. However, it's best not to dwell on the negative. What ""The Simpsons"" was in its heyday is not something to be forgotten, and clearly, television in the 1990s wouldn't have been the same without it!"
"If you review doesn't can the The Simpsons due to recent seasons, look out, the IMDB Simpsons police will vote your review unhelpful. Lol.

The show caused serious controversy at the time, was totally unique and changed the television landscape forever. South Park and Family Guy piggy-backed off the Simpsons; it was the precedent and they simply pushed the envelope harder as was relevant at the time. Still the greatest animated TV show irrespective of what's happened recently."
"Yet again, Disney ruin something which was once brilliant. I used to watch The Simpsons and always had laughs at the gags and character exploits: not anymore. Why do they have so many musical numbers and Woke storylines? Dull and uninspiring writing now. Not for me. I don't watch it anymore."
"The Simpsons is a world treasure but I feel the series has gone on for far too long. Gone are the days of universal innocent jokes that happened in the earlier seasons up to 13. I'm thinking of iconic episodes where they all get separated on a camping trip. Or where they go to Australia. Or where they adopt dear old Apu. Now the latter episodes seem focused on current events making them less relatable to a wider audience.

Overall though, I must say, this is a series that will remain unforgettable and the long-running work of the writers, voice actors, directors and animators is to be commended as their legacy will live on. 7/10."
"I surprisingly had a very difficult time rating this show, but I did and a 5 out of 10 is in my opinion a fair rating when you consider the series as a whole.

The reason it is so hard for me to rate this show is the simple fact that it has been on so very, very long. 621 episodes and growing, according to the numbers here on IMDb. And when a season lasts that long, it obviously will have stretches of good quality and stretches of bad quality. The Simpsons is no different.

Although the series does still make me chuckle here and there, the quality has completely fallen off in the show's later years. It suffered a sudden and terrible decline and I still feel very disappointed watching it, remember and ""missing"" the fantastic episodes of old.

Because that's the other extreme. When The Simpsons first went on the air, and for at least 8 seasons (to me, at least), it was one of the very best comedy shows ever produced. The characters were great, the writing was slick, it seemed like every single joke hit its mark and I laughed out loud all the time. It was one of the few ""can't miss"" shows I remember in my life, where Sundays at 8pm I just had to be home to watch it. Everyone talked about it, and regardless of how many seasons you think it lasted everyone considers those early years the ""golden age"" of the Simpsons.

I'm not sure if the problem is people leaving, or naturally running out of ideas after being on the air so long, or simple laziness, or the writers and staff getting old, but clearly at a point this show just went from the creative tops to something almost awful.

I'm basically averaging it out (6 years of awesomeness, 6 years of being OK, and since then being just bloody awful) to give this show a 5 out of 10.

I know I'll be bashed by haters who find my rating too high, and Simpson-heads who can't believe anyone would go lower than 10, but this is the grade I think is fair for this show."
"The Simpsons is the longest running animated TV series since The Flinstones, and you could understand why after watching just one of the Simpsons episodes. Simply because The Simpsons is just so hilarious and incredibly clever and has been ripped off so many times, but nothing has come close to the brilliance that the Simpsons writers have brought us.

We have Homer Simpson, one of the most beloved TV characters of all time, with his famous quote ""Doh!"". He's an overweight, lazy, and not the brightest bulb, but so incredibly lovable for the fact of how bipolar he is! One minute he can be so incredibly depressed, but the next minute really happy and giggling. My favorite Homer quote is when he kills the zombie Ned Flanders in a Halloween episode, Bart tells him ""Dad! You killed the zombie Flanders!""... ""He was a zombie?"" Marge is Homer's wife and a homemaker. She is at times naggy, but always manages to get in some terrific humor and some deep sympathy with all she puts up with. My favorite Marge quote is ""Bart, don't make fun of grad students. They've just made a terrible life choice."" Bart is the oldest son and a rebel. His usual quotes are ""Don't have a cow"" ""Cool, man!"" ""Ei Carumba!"". He's this generation's Dennis the Menace. My favorite Bart quote is ""I need a soul, Ralph, any, your's!"", you'll see what I mean.

Lisa is the second oldest and the smartie pants of the Simpson clan, she's kind of the know it all who solves all the adventures of the Simpsons. My favorite Lisa quote is ""They're only using you for your pool you know... shut up brain! I have friends now, I don't need you any more!"". Last, but not least, Maggie, the eternal baby of Homer and Marge, always a great love of the screen, but no famous quotes, just memorable moments like when she turns into an alien.

The supporting cast is a terrific addition, my favorites include Mr. Burns, Homer's boss, Groundskeeper Willy, the school janitor, and Mr. Skinner, the school principal. The Simpson is just a terrific show that in one way or another you will see at least one episode in your lifetime. I know that generations to come, they will still be watching The Simpsons."
"This Review is aimed at anyone who has never seen the wire, but may have heard about it from about 3000 people recommending you should watch it. I watched the wire about 3 years ago well after the series concluded, and watched it in the same binge watching way I watched The Sopranos, Breaking Bad, and Game of thrones. I won't compare The Wire to these shows because they are not really comparable other than the fact they are some of the greatest shows ever, but are completely different. The wire isn't about drug dealing, the police, politics, or the education system, it is about the entire city of Baltimore. I'll admit The Wire isn't for everyone, it may be too violent or complex with the vast amount of characters and side stories for some, but I guarantee if you are a film and TV series lover and appreciate writing, acting, and an abundance of interesting characters, the wire is pretty much perfect in these regards. Each Season changes slightly in which facet of the city it will mainly cover, and becomes more complex as the series progresses. This show has without a doubt some of the most interesting characters, and best writing I have ever seen on a series. Even small side characters have intriguing stories that progress throughout the entire series, and I have never seen more attention to detail. This show isn't built up with such high expectations for people who haven't seen it for no reason, watch it , and there is about a 99.99% chance you will become one of those previously mentioned 3000 people recommending it to everyone you know who hasn't seen it."
"I don't even no where to begin to explain how much I love The Wire! It's a crime drama that takes place in Baltimore. It takes a gritty look into the lives of everyone from police officers to gang members to drug users to political figures, etc. The writing and acting for this amazing series is down right brilliant. All you have to do is read through the reviews to see how loved this show really is. The consistency of the greatness of this show throughout all five seasons is ridiculous. The gritty attention to detail makes this series feel so real. It's easily one of the best shows of all-time."
"Along with TV-shows like 'Oz', 'Deadwood', 'The Sopranos' and 'Six Feet Under', David Simon's 'The Wire' was part of a revolution - qualitywise - in television. Although it is very entertaining, this isn't just entertainment; this is art, pure and simple - and the concept of this show was groundbreaking. On the surface, one might think this is a show about crime, but really, 'The Wire' is about the life and soul of a whole city. Every aspect of the city of Baltimore gets its share of screen time, and the way this is done - the writing, the direction, the amazing performances by the terrific cast; the music, the camera work, the realism... I could go on and on - is just outstanding. On par with 'Generation Kill' (no wonder, since the same creative team was behind both), this is as good as television gets.

"The Wire absolutely, without a doubt, lives up to all the hype and love it gets. The storytelling is so ridiculously good and that's because that this is one of the best written shows in television history. It's one of those rare shows where every season is just as good as the others. It's ranked #6 All-Time with a 9.3 rating for a reason... because it's absolutely amazing! If you google any ""best show ever"" list you will find The Wire near the top of every single one. If you've never seen this incredible show then do yourself a favor and go watch it immediately and if you have seen it then go watch it again because it's just that good!"
"This series not winning an Emmy, is why awards are nonsense. Andre Royo alone deserves one for every season this show was on."
"I don't subscribe to HBO. A couple of weeks ago I heard an interview with a young actor from this series on NPR. It was described as a ""gritty crime drama"" with many Baltimore locals portraying variations on themselves. The interview made it sound interesting enough that I decided to check out the first season on DVD.

After the first few episodes I became seriously hooked and devoted 36 hours of the next ten days to the show.

Having now watched the first 3 seasons, I believe it to be the best television series I have seen.

I do not understand why this show hasn't generated the buzz or the awards of HBO's other series, such as the Sopranos or Deadwood. It is more gripping, faster paced, and more intelligent. The other shows can be a bit plodding, with plot lines that go nowhere, and a few characters I don't much care about. That wasn't the case here.

The show is a cross between the Sopranos and the old NBC show Homicide: Life on the Street. The crime/sopranos side and the law/Homicide side run in parallel. Individually, the parallel plot lines are compelling. In tandem, they are complimentary and brilliant.

There is no way to avoid having ""the best show ever"" tag sound like anything but silly hype--regardless, what makes this show substantially better than any other realistic and compelling crime or police drama is the fact it is... searching. It doesn't just delve into the individual psychologies motivating these people (ala the Sopranos) or the complex interactions amongst the members of a community (ala Deadwood) it asks ""what the hell can be done for all of these people"" and points out the problems with any and all of the answers.

It's truly brilliant. If you like intelligent television, I envy the enjoyment you will have watching this for the first time."
"I first attempted to watch this series over a decade ago when I started getting interested in films and tv shows in a major way, but I was still not mature enough to enjoy the more complex kind of TV I see that now. I used to think the show was boring, did not understand half of it, to be fair I am not from USA and some of the language in this show is a little too high level for a non native to understand from both the cops and drug dealers, even now I still don't get a few expressions they do or police terms. I guess I even hated it I only watched the first season and save a few scenes I was mostly bored

Now I feel like my taste has matured a lot since I last saw it, decided to give it another chance, and now I see every scene, every dialogue, every line between the lines and I haven't even finished the first season again and I am loving it, maybe not yet as much as I love Sopranos or Breaking bad which are arguably simpler but very smart, real and entertaining. The Wire does feel more complex on its themes I guess it's too real in a way which is why I thought it was boring the first time, they bother with details normally other TV shows would skip or overlook.

I still think Sopranos is better, it is easier to digest, but without losing that feeling of realism and being relatable on every level, but it doesn't make the wire any less important.

I look forward to finishing it this time and maybe even update my review once I am all done."
"Definetly the most realistic show I have ever watch. You can feel for all of the characters, there is no certain good nor evil like the real life. Acting is also amazing, a piece of fine art. The Wire is a must watch show, trust me you won't regret it."
"I have seen many brilliant shows, and The Wire is one of them. Even the word brilliant isn't enough to put into words how good this series is. The Wire is incredibly well made, with moody lighting, striking location work that also brings atmosphere and great photography, while the music is very haunting. The Wire with its thoughtful and tense dialogue also has some of the best writing of any show I've seen, the stories are ceaselessly compelling and the characters are rich and unforgettable. All the episodes are superbly directed, and very rarely do you feel cheated at the end of episodes. The acting is superb, Dominic West and Idris Elba are especially brilliant. In conclusion, phenomenal. 10/10 Bethany Cox"
"Here's my rating with some little review for every season:

Season 1: 8.5/10 (Impressive start, although the plot feels so slow)

Season 2: 9/10 (Masterpiece of storytelling)

Season 3: 10/10 (Omar Little the champions of people)

Season 4: 11/10 (is this a real life? Is this just fantasy?)

Season 5: 9.5/10 (such a perfect conclusion)"
"I heard that during it's initial run that The Wire's creator David Simon had to convince executives to not cancel the show. Take a moment to digest that. Cancelling The Wire... You look at shows today, Riverdale, The Flash... all these PATHETIC shows that keep on running for no reason and The Wire, the GREATEST TV SHOW was almost cancelled.

The Characters are so intricately crafted to mirror relationships on both sides. There is no singular 'main character' but a collection of talented actors playing the role made for them. OMAR LITTLE. One of the greatest television characters.

Show, don't tell. Perfectly executed. The right song at the right time to clue you in. The quote at the start of the episode always, ALWAYS has a deeper meaning than you think."
"Possibly the best thing written for television ever; certainly the best to come out in the last 25 or so years.

""The Wire"" escapes the melodramatic pitfalls of shows like ""the West Wing,"" ""Six Feet Under"" and even ""The Sopranos"" (which are all smartly written--or rather have had their moments of greatness).

Here is a show which over the course of 37 hours weaves together scores of very tautly detailed characters. It's not easy to watch--and its certainly challenging. But it is surely worth it.

The story unfolds in Baltimore and is a study on the effect of institutions on its members: police, politicians, criminals, addicts.

Some may find the show didactic. This is understandable because its creators make heavy usage of allegory (for instance, seasons three's not-so-subtle criticism of the situation in Iraq).

Didactic or not, the show forces its viewers to think about and hopefully start a larger discussion of the issues it touches upon: the failure of the drug war, the gradual extinction of the American worker and the dangers of a presumptive, preemptive war.

Hats off to creators David Simon and Ed Burns (a retired BPD detective) for creating one of the most interesting, daring shows in the history of television.

Let's hope HBO renews it for another 26 episodes."
"I find it surprising to see everyone likes this show so much. Sure, the cast, direction, camera and writing are outstanding; definitely some of the best on TV, but I found the story to be lacking the entertainment value. I found the praised realism of the show to be too... real, to really be enjoyable. For a person who was in the army or police or had dealings with other uniformed organizations, the show just reaffirms what they already know. State organizations are indeed mostly governed by people doing each other favors, protecting their asses and doing as little of what is required as possible, while appearing to be doing their job. To a person who has little contact with uniformed organizations, the workings of the police department portrayed in The Wire seem realistic but unbelievable. While the acquainted person probably yearns to see another way to do things, the unacquainted hopes for the despicable vision to be finally dispelled. Not only does this not happen, but the last season shows that even people with the best intentions get corrupted and broken and the only way to manage to do something right is to lie and cheat while at it.

I resented the show for giving me no closure, no satisfaction of seeing at least some improvement to the world resulting from pained efforts of the positive characters.

""A life, Jimmy, you know what that is? It's the sh*t that happens while you're waiting for moments that never come."" - Lester Freamon. That quote summarizes the show for me. Those moments I was waiting for never came. Moments where I would think things could be different than I expect, moments where I would learn something new.

I can recommend The Wire to people who want to get insight into how governmental organizations work. When having a beer with friends, if people ask me how it is in the Police or the Army, instead of explaining, I can tell them: ""see The Wire, it shows that perfectly""."
"I seriously don't get the hype regarding this show. It was so slow moving and boring. When I watch a show about the gritty streets or seedy side of any city, I expect there to be a little more engaging action. I don't want Michael Bay, but I also want more than one life to live.

No doubt the acting is amazing. The problem is that some of the characters are so uninteresting. And the stories each episode that are not driving along the plot were so boring. I forced myself to watch Season 1. I couldn't even get into it. When it finally became relatively interesting, I was able to watch a couple episodes before getting bored again. I tried Season 2, but that first episode is mindnumbingly not interesting. Nothing drags you in. I said forget this, I won't be one of the lovers of the wire. I even tried reading episode and season synopses, but even they bored me.

I get why many people are drawn to this show. It takes you deeper into characters' psyches than most. Bla bla bla. But at the end of the day, I don't care. I want to be entertained. I want to escape. This bored me to no end."
"I say that without a shred of hyperbole. The Wire's importance, beyond setting the standard for all modern television, is one of a historical document. 500 years from now, the show will surely be one of a handful that allows future generations to glean the state of American society during this time period -- it's problems, it's people, it's language, it's institutions, and the constant tension that exists when all of these are forced to coexist.

This is due to the fact that the Wire, through nuance and true-to- life portrayal of human interactions, constructs an extremely lucid and heart-breaking evaluation of almost every aspect of society. Most of you reading right now wake up every day as a cog in the massive, interwoven, and fundamentally autonomous institutions which together make up a capitalist society. However, given that we are all a minuscule part of this larger whole, it is nary impossible to take a step back and objectively evaluate just how much influence these institutions hold over the course of our lives. It's not unlike trying summarize a 1000-page novel while holding a single random page less than an inch from your face. Our perspectives are inherently limited in this regard, and so too is any vain attempt to connect the pieces and make sense of it all.

This point is one of the many reasons that the Wire warrants our time and careful consideration. From a bird's-eye perspective, each season builds on those prior until at the very end we have no choice but to reckon with vast tapestry of individual strands as a singular work. One that feels so true to life that it's near impossible for me to think of anything else, fiction or non-fiction, book or movie, painting or play, sculpture or architectural feat, which in their combined power holds the volume of educational lessons, thoughtfulness, humanism, pure ethos, or entertainment that the Wire does.

""All the pieces matter,"" a quote that flashes across the screen at the beginning of an episode in Season One, is prophetic in it's understanding that the totality of something can have a much greater impact than its individual parts. And that is why I find it upsetting when reading reviewers which call the show ""boring"" or ""slowly paced"" or ""overrated"" and then go on to admit that they gave up watching before the end of Season Two.

I am not a cynic by nature and in general tend to dismiss the common criticism that our generation is one that needs constant gratification all of the time in order to stay engaged with something for the long haul. But in this case, I truly believe that the Wire is so much different than what most people are used to watching on the medium of television that some may get confused or frustrated when the show refuses to pander to the standard beats and thrill-inducing plot devices on an episode-by-episode basis which we have been trained to expect with TV shows. There are no neatly wrapped episode arcs, no spoon-feeding over obvious plot points via voice-overs or flashbacks, and no musical score to tell us how a particular scene or moment should make us feel.

Instead, the show forces us to become witnesses to a series of events in much the same way we would witness something unfolding right in front of us. Especially during Season One, David Simon and his creative team give us a lot of footage that looks like it should be from a documentary. This is all intentional, of course. The 4:3 film, the non-HD look, the way the camera seems to lack the traditional god- like power to always know that a character is going to say something important so that it shows us that character a second or two before they say their line (indeed, if you watch closely you'll notice that there are times that the camera will only pan to a speaking character after they begin saying their lines, giving the viewer the distinct feeling of a real-life situation unfolding in real time) -- all of these things are by careful design. And all of these devices add to the show's power because the characters become more real when depicted in this way. This makes it all the more devastating every time one of these characters is chewed up and spit out by the merciless wheels of capitalistic institutions surrounding them.

I chose to write a review which differs from many of the others here because simply rehashing why I love Omar so much, or which season is the best, or why I think it's better/worse than the Sopranos or Breaking Bad are all things which are touched upon over and over again. Instead I wanted to provide my own analysis about why the show succeeds and stands apart of from others to the point where comparison is futile. Some people, including myself, think that the show will provide you with such an empathy-rich experience that when you have finished you may potentially see the world a little bit differently, that you'll feel a little bit closer to all of the people you share this country with, no matter how different their persona or background is from your own. By this measure, your persistence and patience given to the show will be repaid 10-fold."
"HBO's ""The Wire"", another ground breaking TV crime series from David Simon who grandfathered ""Homicide: Life on the Street"", raises the bar for crime dramas by dedicating a whole season (13 episodes) to a single story with unparalleled realism. Telling of a motley bunch of detectives who set about to bring down a Baltimore drug ring which supplies a black innercity housing project, the gritty 12 hour first year series slowly develops a broad range of characters from street punks to senators in a world where the blacks and whites of good and evil are reduced to shades of gray and everyone is connected by their humanity for better or for worse. Not the usual cops vs bad guys fare with episodic ups and downs, ""The Wire"" is one long drama about people which happens in a law enforcement and crime setting. For realists only, this series will require some viewer patience while the complexities of the plot and the characters are developed. One of a kind...so far. (A)"
"Millennials will laugh at this time capsule of the 00's; Pay phones, pagers, the 00's cars, tiny flip-phones, cathode ray televisions...But this is GREAT TV! Excellent cast and production, story lines that are timeless, and still revelant. Great stuff !"
Hate to be rude but don't pay attention to the moronic post below. That was some of the most lame criticism I have ever come across on this site. I doubt the guy even watched the entire first season. This show is the best thing going on TV. Writing. Direction. Acting. Its all perfection. The people behind the show are former journalists and police officers who were covering crime in Baltimore or working the beat as cops for over 20 years. They know what they speak of and don't rely on cookie cutter characterization. This is the closest thing to a novel that you will find on TV. It is so impeccably plotted and so honest and realistic that I will never be able to watch another cop show (or any TV drama) without comparing it to this example of television greatness. Did I mention its also the smartest TV show on the air too? The Sopranos gets the media attention but it can't match the sophistication and grittiness of The Wire. The Sopranos is a romanticized TV crime drama by comparison. And as for Six Feet Under? Please! It reached its peak in its final six episodes of the first season and haven't lived up to that magic since. It doesn't get any better than The Wire. Universal critical acclaim. The winner of the 2002 TV Critics awards. The winner of the 2004 Peabody award. Nuff said.
"You want to get close to the streets? This is it, and what a true American tragedy it plays out to be. The drama is scintillating, without being sensational. These are real people, in real life, with real struggles, played beautifully by an incredibly talented Dominic West and crew.

True politics, true characters, real struggles, genuine, small triumphs,and a lot of poetic moments that are incidental and not self aware. Gotta love that.

Impeccable. Everything I always wished from a crime drama. Check it out."
"The show's writing is nothing short of masterful. David Simon, a former journalist, brings a level of authenticity and depth that is rare in television. The dialogue is sharp and often laden with social and political commentary, yet it never feels preachy. The storylines are complex and interwoven, requiring viewers to pay close attention as the show gradually reveals the connections between characters and events. This narrative structure is one of the reasons ""The Wire"" is often considered challenging but rewarding to watch. It demands patience and reflection, rewarding viewers with a rich, multilayered experience that lingers long after the final credits roll."
"Rarely do you see a show like this that has so much ambition in what it's trying to accomplish, and more rarely do you see a show like this succeed in it's intention of doing so. Let me introduce you The Wire, the best TV show put on small screens. The show that will, after you've finished it, live you empty inside, because you'll never find another TV show that can rival it. With it's five seasons, The Wire raised the bar of quality for TV shows, the bar that no TV show to date has managed to reach.

The Wire's story is set in the city of Baltimore, and it's about the slow fall of Baltimore city, about the pointlessness of the war on drugs, the bureaucracy and corruption that infest both the police force and drug-dealing gangs, class war against the labor unions, and the city's dysfunctional public schools system. And it's all shown through the perspective of law enforcement and drug dealers. As the story goes, you'll encounter well thought out plot twists, and you'll see a lot of characters die, because, as David Simon said: ""We are not selling hope, or audience gratification, or cheap victories with this show. The Wire is making an argument about what institutions—bureaucracies, criminal enterprises, the cultures of addiction, raw capitalism even—do to individuals. It is not designed purely as an entertainment. It is, I'm afraid, a somewhat angry show."", and that makes the show so great, because deaths have meanings and consequences, and aren't just there for the shock factor like in Game Of Thrones. It also helps that Simons knows what he's talking about since he was writing a lot for the Baltimore Sun, and he saw a lot of things on the streets that are portrayed in the show.

One of the things I really love about The Wire is that characters aren't all good or all bad. They're gray, when it comes to their morality. Simon challenges the viewer to like characters, a lot of characters will do some bad things, and you'll probably agree on a lot of them given the situation they're in. The writing is just great, The Wire has a web of a lot of characters and the show spins them well. From McNulty to Stringer Bell, there are a lot of complex and great written characters, but there are also some weaker ones, but that's also to be expected, because the show has more than the hundred characters and you can't expect that they'll all be on the same level of writing. There is no plot armor in this show, a lot of characters will die, and, as I've already said, their deaths have consequences, and aren't just meant to be shock factor.

Acting team consists of familiar HBO actors, and of real cops and criminals, and they all did a pretty damn good job. Some are weaker, and that is most notable during season 1 and 5, but weak actor aren't that usual in the show, so don't worry. I'd say the best actor is easily Dominic West as McNulty, who stole the show for me, but since I'm biased towards McNulty, don't take my word for granted.

The only problem I had with the The Wire was one of fifth season's arcs, the one with the newspapers. It felt out of place for me, and it wasn't that interesting. It didn't introduce interesting characters nor was it on par with The Wire's better arcs.

In the end, The Wire did what little to no TV show could hope to do, it succeed with it's extremely ambitious, and I'd say impossible mission to tell a story of Baltimore's crumble. The social commentary, the writing on the characters, the well thought out plot twists, great directory, and David Simon's expertise on the case made The Wire the best television show ever seen on small screens. Enjoy the ride while it lasts, because once it ends, you'll be left with an empty whole within yourself, because they'll never be a TV show that could rival The Wire. Now go watch it already!"
"Season 3 of The Wire ended like a great novel, in a series of great novels, about crime, politics, ""po-lice"" and personalities in the City of Baltimore. The Wire truly has no equivalent on American TV, more akin to something like the British miniseries Traffik, or Robert Altman's Short Cuts, but really in a class by itself. The show also doesn't fetch the ratings of HBO's other blockbuster series, like The Sopranos or Deadwood, but so far the network has stood behind what is indisputably a creative / artistic success. Viewers accustomed to having a Tony Soprano or an Al Swearingen to latch onto may be daunted by The Wire's 2-dozen or so ""main"" characters, all given equal importance within multiple story lines. The concurrent tales all buoy one another, and as the season draws to a close, they begin to merge and compliment each other in unexpected ways. No detail is too small to not be done with great care, and no significant threads are left to hang, which also speaks to the brilliance of the writers.

The Wire is no less than a dramatic triumph, and I can't wait for a new season."
"I don't understand! 9.3? Why? How? This is not a bad show i can see that, but seriously it's way too slow and boring and so overrated! I'm on season 2 episode 2, i really tried, but i'm gonna stop here. i don't care about any character or storyline and i came to this conclusion : i'm bored!! I don't enjoy anything on this show. One of the best show ever? Not even close!!! Realistic doesn't mean good."
"Rome is a very detailed and historically accurate show that will keep you hooked throughout the series. It really is one of the most underrated tv shows ever created and a true masterpiece that is pretty much loved by anyone who has ever seen it. Just read through the reviews to see how loved this show really is! It's only two seasons long but those two seasons were damn near perfect! The acting, writing, directing, cinematography, production, etc. Are all fantastic. It doesn't get nearly the recognition it deserves because it wasn't advertised that much when it was on and pre social media so word of mouth was hard back then. I really can't say anything more that hasn't already been said about this terrific show except to just go watch it!"
"I Claudius was maybe the best miniseries ever. Now, there's Rome, and it's even better.

I agree with another reviewer, that quibbles about historical inaccuracies, such as accents or how old so-and-so should be, are silly pedantry. I've been a Roman history buff ever since my own high school triumvirate of Caesar, Cicero and Virgil, and I say that this historical fiction is both exciting AND quite accurate with the important stuff.

So far, every player has been terrific, in particular Ciarán Hinds as Caesar and Max Pirkis as Octavian. Julius Caesar was perhaps the most complex ""great"" figure in history. Was he a great populist, trying to champion the people against the Optimates, or was he an ambitious demagogue, who was using the Roman mobs to attain the imperium? Hinds depicts this complexity perfectly, while projecting a steely will that is shared by Caesar's emerging protégé, Octavian. Thanks to Max Pirkis's brilliant portrayal, we can already see the no-nonsense pragmatism, ruthlessness and brilliance that will propel this boy into becoming the greatest despot in history.

And what about that dissolute Mark Anthony? We can already see Actium in his face. And with Atia, I think Livia (as depicted in I Claudius) and Messalina have met their match.

And midst the struggle for mastery of Rome, we see the struggle of more common folk just to make a living. Rome makes the parallel stories of the Optimates and Centurian, now Prefect, Vorenus and Legionnaire Pullo a perfect vehicle for comparing the travails of different classes  their love lives, social lives, how they treated the servants, how they practiced their faiths, how they fought. Seen from these different perspectives (which we did not get with I Claudius), we get a three-dimensional view and, for me, the closest to feeling like one is actually there of any historical fiction ever produced.

And look at the production values. Is it any wonder, when we see who's behind the camera  Michael Apted and John Milius  that we have an immaculately crafted work?

By their commitment to quality of production and integrity of story, HBO and BBC are demonstrating what television can be. This is a wonderful, wonderful series. Anyone with a love of history, drama and spectacle should be devouring it with delight."
"Rome is absolutely, without a doubt, one of the best and most underrated tv series of all-time and is easily one of my favorite shows. The show centers around two Roman soldiers, Titus Pollo (Ray Stevenson) and Lucius Vorenus (Kevin McKidd), as they are caught up in the biggest historical events and involved with the biggest historical figures of that era. The series is also as historically accurate as any show surrounding that era is. HBO is known for being the best when it comes to their tv shows and Rome is right there with the best of them. The entire cast of this show does an incredible job, every actor and actress on screen come off as completely believable. The attention to detail on this show is amazing, the show just takes you into their world and that era and doesn't let go of you. You'll want to binge this series as fast as possible."
"HBO's ""Rome"" is perhaps one of the best historical TV shows there ever was and one of the best HBO has ever produced.

Set during the first century B.C., this TV show tells the tale of two Romans serving in the army, Lucius Vorenus and Titus Pollo. Vorenus in a strict, humorless and hard-working centurion, expecting his troops to obey him and is a loyal citizen of Rome. Pollo is muscular, carefree, party-loving, and womanizing, yet he is also a faithful, trustworthy friend, loyal companion, and overall lovable character. These two military men serve in Julius Caesar's army and live during a time of turmoil in Rome.

Originally planned as a TV miniseries, ""Rome"" has become an actual TV show. This TV show is mostly fictional, but it incorporates historical characters like Caesar, Pompey, Cato, Mark Anthony, and Atia, the most of Octavian, soon to become Rome's first emperor, Augustus. It is a time when the Roman Republic is corrupt, and high-ranking Romans like Julius Caesar and Pompey fight for power. The historical events in Rome are told thru the eyes of Vorenus and Pollo.

The script is intelligent and realistic, with some profanity, violence, and decadence. Unlike most portrayals of Rome, which tend to be clean and sanitize things, this is a graphic portrayal of Ancient Rome, complete with drunkards, brawlers, womanizers, prostitutes, adulterers, fornication, and loads of sexual acts. This TV series do not attempt to hide the dirty aspects of the Roman Empire. Rather, it is a honest depiction of the Empire, portraying its decadence and wickedness.

As for the production, one word - great! The sets are huge and realistic, with the viewer feeling as if he/she is in the middle of the scene. The costumes, too, are realistic and accurate. The sets, props, and costumes, etc. show signs of research. The actors and actresses did a great job, too, portraying their characters realistically.

Overall, this is a great series. I will be expecting more seasons of this."
"I've become so bored of mainstream television over the last decade that I now make a point of only watching series that are history-related, given my huge love of the subject matter. I missed ROME when it was first shown, but heard so much good about it that I caved in and bought the box set on Blu-ray. I'm so glad I did; believe the hype, ROME is the ultimate in costume drama.

The series only lasted for two seasons before cancellation, but every episode is a winner. There are two story strands running through: the big story and the little story. The big story is concerned with the legendary figures of history - in the first season Julius Caesar and his cohorts, and in the second Mark Antony. The little story looks at the minor characters, the soldiers and families involved with the politics of their era.

The script crackles with realistic dialogue and the characters are superb. Not just Pullo and Vorenus, but also Atia and her offspring, Brutus and his mother, even the minor players who are awarded little dialogue. Every actor is amazing, with Ciaran Hinds stealing the show in the first series and James Purefoy in the second.

I'm pleased that the producers went all-out in making an adult drama, not skimping on the sexual content or the violence. It's hard to pick highlights in a series that never puts a foot wrong, but Pullo's diversion in the gladiator arena is hard to beat in terms of its sheer power. The ending of season two, with Antony descending into madness, is chilling and moving in equal measure.

It took a good few years, but I'm pleased to report that TV producers are finally capitalising on ROME's success and beginning to make similar products as they realise a market for adult-focused historical drama. Already we're seeing the likes of SPARTACUS (three series and counting), CAMELOT, GAME OF THRONES, THE BORGIAS and THE TUDORS, each of them indebted to ROME in some way. I'll enjoy watching them, but I doubt any will equal the quality of this."
"Simply put, this is one of the most underrated shows of all time. The attention to detail is absolutely astounding. The story arcs are captivating. Although only two seasons long, Rome is like reading a gripping novel!"
"I only wish there was more seasons. It has it all, love, war, death"
"HBO does it again. I got my start with the network back in 1990 with a sitcom called Dream On. From there, I have followed the yellow brick road through Sex and the City, Sopranos, Six Feet Under, Band of Brothers, From the Earth to the Moon and Deadwood (not to mention hours and hours of boxing, documentary specials and tons of movies).

HBO now presents a miniseries about the Roman Empire, appropriately called ""Rome"". The story revolves around the time Julius Ceasar conquers Gaul, and the subsequent years following that (Ceasar's rise to dictator). The series delves into historical and archaeological records, with a dash of artistic licensing to create an environment that seems so real. For the most part the series is divided into 3 parts :

1) Julius Caesar's rise to unanimous political power.

2) The exploits (in the field and at home) of a Roman officer, Luscious Vorenus, and one of the soldiers under his command (whom becomes his friend), Titus Pollo.

3) The various political and social interactions and manipulations of Caesars relatives, namely Atia and her two offspring, Octavian and Octavia.

4) Post Caesarian Rome.

The production of this series is quite breathtaking. It seems like they took into account so many of the variables ; costumes, jewelry, architecture, religious practices, mannerism, military units, social venues, politics, class structure,etc. to bring the empire back to life in the 21st century. They went as far as to train the extras portraying the Roman soldiers in boot camp fashion. All were to sleep in tents outside and were provided with no modern amenities.

This series has something for everyone with a strong stomach and inclination towards the graphic. The show is going for authenticity. This is not Rome seen through the eyes of 21st century people, but rather through they eyes of 1st century BC Romans. It has action, graphic violence, sex, incest, betrayal, murder, Machiavellian scheming, politics, family bonding, war,etc. I just can't begin to describe just how authentic the show feels and how hypnotically captivating it is to watch (especially in High Definition). I can't help but feel that John Milius (as a writer and executive producer) has brought some of the same grit and grime from Conan (albeit with a more historic flavor). Also on the writing credits is work from Entourage, Sex and the City, Band of Brothers and Desperate Housewives.

The acting core is quite good, consisting mostly on an English cast with theatrical experience. Their performances are quite good and contains many veterans and some newcomers (at least to me). Such standouts would include : Indira Varma (of Kama Sutra fame) who plays Luscious' wife Niobe, Kerry Condon (whom I first saw in Jet Li's Danny the Dog) as Atti's daughter Octavia, Kenneth Cranham (Jimmy from Layer Cake) as Pompey, Kevin McKidd (from Trainspotting and Dog Soldiers) as Luscious, Polly Walker as Atia and Ray Stevenson as Titus.

To add to the authenticity, the series was shot at Cinecitta Studios in Rome. This gives the series an extra flavor. I highly recommend this series, but only for those that can stomach graphic sex, violence and a lot of the Queen's English. It is currently my favorite show, and wishing it could last 1000 years.

"WHY was this series canceled?!!! While waiting for the new season of Game of Thrones to return, my husband and I started watching Rome on demand to stave off our epic genre addiction and we Love it! We were so disappointed to find out that it had been canceled! What a shame and only 2 seasons? Why?

Fans FYI: Having never heard of the characters Vorenus and Pullo, I assumed they were probably fictional characters but I did some digging and found that Vorenus and Pullo are only semi-fictional characters and were two of the very few plebeians/soldiers mentioned by Caesar in his writings, whose names appear as 'Titus Pulcio' and 'Lucius Varenus'. The first mention of Varenus and Pulcio comes in Caesar's Commentaries on the Gallic War.

Caesar tells us that the camp of the XIII legion was attacked by the Nervii in 54 BC and was about to be overrun. Pulcio jumped the ramparts to fight hand-to-hand with the Nervii. Varenus, not wanting Pulcio to reap all the glory, then jumps the ramparts too, killing many of enemy. As a demonstration of ""brotherly love"" and comradeship, they each save the other's life at certain points during the fight. Caesar said it was impossible to decide who was braver.

HBO, PLEASE bring Rome back!"
"Having watched the first three episodes, I am anxiously looking forward to seeing the rest of the episodes. All of the intrigue that was Rome is presented well, considering that no one involved lived during that time that could give accurate details on Roman life. For that matter, all historical presentations that are over a hundred years old are filled in with speculation and assumption and for that no one can discredit the attempts at accuracy.

For all of the naysayers, listen well. You complain that the show is full of pointelss dialogue. Rome was one of the first political empires to exist. When you have a Senate, it becomes very political. As for the accuracies to design, as I said, we can only speculate in accordance to available artifacts, as to how the place really looked. The designs do look as I picture in my own mind. Another complaint that I saw was about the sex with one such comment relating Rome to ""Skinimax"". The fact is this is set prior to Christian corruption, shunning the act of sex. So yes, there was a lot of it."
"Devastatingly good. Devastating - because there are only 2 seasons. Leaves you wanting more, and in a state of mourning when you realise that you will not get it.

Needless to be said, this is some very well done work!

Everything from the script, acting, storyline to the wonderful sets and costumes. Not to mention the well-written characters of course! It really transports you back to the Roman era. Whether you are a history buff or not, you will enjoy this one! It is a true gem, take my word for it.

My only wish is that I could forget about ever knowing about it so that I could watch it for the first time all over again.

Before Game of Thrones there was Rome, and in all honesty, I wish they had given this show whatever attention they chose to give the former, comparatively speaking, this one is far superior in every way possible."
"In this British historical drama, the turbulent transition from the Roman Republic to the autocratic empire, which changed world history through civil wars and wars of conquest, is outlined both from the aristocratic point of view of Julius Caesar (Ciarán Hinds), his family, his confrontation against Pompey Magnus (Kenneth Cranham), his adopted successor Gaius Octavian Augustus (Max Pirkis), his ally Mark Antony (James Purefoy) and political adversaries, and from the politically popular point of view of a few ordinary Romans , in particular the soldiers Lucio Voreno and Tito Pullo and their families. The main characters, Lucius Vorenus (Ray Stevenson) and Titus Pullo (Kevin McKidd), are named after real-life historical figures. They are mentioned in Caesar's Gallic Wars as two close associates with disputes between them over each other's bravery and over who will be promoted to Primus Pilus. They are referred to as explicitly brave when Marcus Tullius Cicero's brother was besieged. Then Caesar's love affairs with Cleopatra take place. When he goes to Egypt he receives the head of Pompey from Ptolemy XIII, which was not a dish of pleasure for Julius. Furious, he orders his executioners to be beheaded, and then sides with the faction of Cleopatra VII with whom he has a son and defeats Ptolemy. Some time later, in Rome he is murdered in the Senate by Brutus (Tobias Menzies) and Cassius. Antony is married to Octavia, Augustus's sister. After that, Antony marries Cleopatra and they are defeated by Augustus at Actium. After the assassination of Caesar by the senators, among others by his protégé Brutus , his political heir Augustus takes power. Before Spartacus: Sand of Blood. Before Game of Thrones. There was Rome! Rome without government... The lust for power begins! What would you do for power? Every city has its secret!

A good historical series turning out to be quite entertaining, dealing with Roman times during the fall of the Republic, providing decent performances and acceptable production design. And with an interesting and attractive script by the best writers, such as: William J. MacDonald, Scott Buck, Todd Ellis Kessler, Alexandra Cunningham, David Frankel but the real creators and show-runners were Bruno Heller and John Milius. The various directors: Michael Apted, Mikael Salomon, Allen Coulter, Steve Shill, Alan Taylor, Jeremy Podeswa, Adam Davidson, Carl Franklin, Alik Sakharov, Roger Young were determined to create a more authentic, evocative, realist and raw representation of classical Rome than films like Stanley Kubrick's Spartacus (1960) or Ridley Scott's Gladiator (2000), which featured a shiny and prosperous version referred to as Holy Rome. Historical consultants stated that they did extensive research to be as real as possible, although they strove for authenticity rather than accuracy as they were not making a documentary. This series follows the history of the Roman Empire, from the first triumvirate: Crassus, Pompey, Caesar, following the life and death of Julius, as a powerful aristocratic family rises to power. Dealing with the extraordinary rise of Julius Caesar and subsequently Augustus, who overcame adversity to become the most powerful leaders in the world. This tangled story is about Caesar, Pompey, Marcus Antonius, the Roman Julia-Claudian dynasty, during the bloody civil wars, which will later follow a long 'Pax Romana' ruled by Octavian Augustus. The 'Pontifex Maximus' Octavius Augustus was the nephew and heir of Julius Caesar, and after the assassination of the latter on the 'Ides of March', he formed the second triumvirate with Mark Antony and Lepidus. And then he proclaimed himself Emperor, being succeeded by other much worse emperors such as Tiberius, Caligula, Claudius and Nero.

This television hit within the historical framework was produced by HD Vision Studios, British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC), Home Box Office (HBO) Sky Atlantic who brought Ancient Rome to life with a treatment in which sex and swords are mixed, with many scenes of love, violence and strong confrontations. Sex and violence on the plates in this peculiar portrait of Roman times that precedes and serves as a model for the less successful ¨Domina¨ (2021) which starred Livia (Kasia Smutniak) - wife of Augustus - as the cunning empress who little by little he tries to get his son Tiberius to assume the throne."
"I only started subscribing to HBO a few years ago, so I never got to see this show when it was live. However, after watching the first season of Game of Thrones more times than I could count, I wanted something new. I had heard great things about this show, and to my delight, I found the Blu Ray set for Season 1 one day for only 25 bucks. I immediately started watching it with my wife, who loves a lot of the same HBO original series as I do (Sex and the City, The Sopranos, True Blood, Game of Thrones, etc). After watching the first few highly unsatisfying episodes, we looked at each other and my wife said ""I'm not captivated"". I said, ""me neither"". Meh. What am I missing here? Why did everyone go completely ga-ga over this series? Was it just fresh at the time? Maybe I'm spoiled by Game of Thrones, so when I see an inferior political/war drama, I can recognize it.

I must be totally missing what made this series so popular. One of the biggest problems is that the script and acting are terrible. This is supposed to be an authentic portrayal of ancient Rome, but it is littered with tons of British slang that sticks out like a sore thumb. The show constantly reminds you that you are not watching actual ancient Rome, but a bunch of British actors acting like one-dimensional, uptight jerks. The show feels like a daytime soap opera, and not the brilliant, realistic narrative that I was expecting. This show makes backstabbing, insulting, and betrayal about as boring as it could possibly be. Julius Caesar comes across to me as just another unemotional stuffy British guy, when he should be a guy that oozes charisma in buckets. This show utterly failed to convince me that this was a genius who led grand armies.

Another major problem with this show is that the most significant events often happen off screen. The worst example of this problem is halfway through the first season when Caesar's army is badly outnumbered and surrounded, and it looks like it's curtains for Julius. But then a massive battle happens off screen, and somehow Caesar wins. How he won is never actually explained. Clever tactics? An inspiring speech? Luck? Weather? All that we know is that the suspense, fear, and drama that was built up during the previous hour was all meaningless. This is a pattern repeated throughout this show. How am I supposed to care about what happens on this show when I don't even get to witness the most significant events? To me, that is like taking the great action scene at the end of ""The Road Warrior"" out of the movie and replacing it with some voice-over saying ""the good guys won"". Rome also does a poor job of giving you context for the major historical events that it portrays. I think that it might assume that the viewer is already an expert on ancient history, and it is merely filling in the blanks dramatically. I'm not an expert on ancient history, so I don't understand how Julius Caesar and Magnus Pompey got to be such bitter enemies. I almost felt like my Blu-Ray set was missing five crucial episodes of exposition.

Rome also really goes over the top when it comes to the sex. Rome has about as much sex as True Blood, but unlike that show, the sex in Rome isn't comical, and it usually isn't appropriate for the story either. It is more contrived and gratuitous. In one short scene, we see a Roman soldier nailing some lady from behind against a tree, not having seen how they met or how he seduced her. That was another moment where my wife and I kind of looked at each other like we were missing something.

Rome does at least have a couple of decent plot lines. The stories of the soldiers Lucius Vorenus and Titus Pullo are entertaining, and they supply the only (effective) comic relief. Vorenus is an uptight guy who can't do much besides fight. He is a lousy husband and he fails as a businessman. Pullo is more of a happy-go-lucky, crowd pleaser, woman pleaser type. The friendship that they strike up is interesting, as is the story of teenage Octavian, who possesses cynicism and knowledge beyond his years.

I watched ten episodes of the first season, and I don't feel all that strongly compelled to finish it. It has its moments, and I find the subject matter interesting despite its bungled presentation. Still, after hearing so much about how great this series was (from people whose opinions I usually agree with), I was very disappointed. I was hoping for a drama about war, politics, and the harshness of ancient life that featured good storytelling and realistic behaviors. In other words, I wanted something as good as Game of Thrones. I guess I'll stick with that."
"HBO's ""Rome"" was great. I started to wonder why I was just seeing it. The story perfectly balances historical accuracy and gripping storytelling. The show brings ancient Rome to life, from Julius Caesar to Augustus, with impressive attention to detail. Characters like Lucius Vorenus and Titus Pullo have amazing arcs, making you care deeply about their journeys. Even though the series had to wrap up quickly due to potential cancellation, it delivers one of the most satisfying endings I've seen. If you love history and drama, ""Rome"" is a must-watch. It's both educational and incredibly entertaining."
"This was one of the most exciting and historically interesting series on HBO. It was a shame that it only lasted two seasons. This look at the Rise and Fall of Julius Caesar during the Roman Empire was so interesting, historically accurate, and attended to details. The series was framed as being seen through the eyes of two Roman Centurians mentioned in a speech of Julius Casear in real life is engaging from moment one. It is also filled with explicit sex and violence. The Direction and cinematography are worthy of any motion picture. The costumes are wonderful. The acting is top notch by the lead and supporting cast. This is how historical series should be done."
"Still the best series I've ever watched.

I think it is more of a travesty that this only got 2 seasons, than Firefly only getting one. (Bring it, nerds.)

Kevin McKidd and Ray Stevenson, as Lucius Vorenus and Titus Pullo - are the most likable 'odd couple' you will ever watch on film.

James Purefoy's Marc Antony is amazing, as is Ciarán Hinds' Caesar.

Season 2 comes in a bit short of 1.







But Kevin McKidd and Ray Stevenson are the heart and soul, so the negatives don't weigh it down much. And James Purefoy gets even more time to shine in season 2."
"A very excellent series and a very good acting performance by most of the actors, especially those who played the role of August Cesar in the second part"
"I am a little bit less enthusiastic about these series than the majority of the viewers in IMDb who seem to be really enthusiastic. To be sure, this is one of the best series on TV based on old history but this maybe tells more about TV series until now. I am writing this after having completed the viewing of the second season, and my rating would be 8.5 for the first season and 7 for the second.

On the good side I would mention the effort made on reconstructing the life and landscape of ancient Rome, even if some limits of the budget may be seen especially in the dimensions of the set. The day-to-day life and the morals are however splendidly caught and the first episode in the first series shine on these. Then we get a little accustomed and nothing significantly new shows up. I also liked the script which makes of many of the historic characters real people, does seldom fall into rhetoric, does not hesitate to take distance from some of the classical approaches in literature and theater, and succeeds to stay credible and interesting for most of the time. The pair Titus and Lucius who run their parallel story of friendship in parallel to the intrigues of famous historical figures is greatly acted, human, and moving. All looks like a god soap opera set in ancient times, and I am using this term in a very positive way, because good soap operas catch the attention and make the viewers care about the fate of the heroes.

On the bad side I would mention the repeated use of modern day slang, which breaks the convention and hurts credibility. Whatever the directors or script authors believe, repeated use of four letters words does not fit well in a movie about ancient Rome, and having Mark Anthony call Cleopatra 'baby' is hard to take either. There are also some continuity problems like the change of the actor playing Octavanus, as well as some side conflicts especially in the second season that seem more designed to fill in time, and are less connected to the rest.

I am curious if there will be a third season. The final seems to leave this opportunity open, and there certainly are enough events and screen-worth stories in the history of Rome. I would certainly follow and watch them."
"I loved this series. It was well written, well acted, and fairly close to historically accurate as possible, everything considered. It was an expensive series, and you can tell. The quality of the sets, the exterior scenes...so well done. I laugh at the detractors, I mock them.

This is NOT a documentary. Get over it. I loved this production, from start to finish. Well worth watching, and I've seen it probably 20 times."
"I saw the ROME Series, Both Season 1 & 2, in a weeks time.. And the last four episodes, in one go.. Such was my addiction to this splendid series that, I am still awestruck...

Kudos to the production house ""HBO"", for coming out with an extra - ordinary series worth every bit.. To start with, the cast was spectacular.. It was a sheer magic.. Every artist came up with such a captivating performance and it is bound to leave the mark... The actors, support crew, the newsreader (you would love him and start imitating his way immediately), the ladies... You name it and you have it in this series...

I had to wait an eternity to get my hands on this series.. My favorite characters, Lucius Vorenus and Titus Pullo were the best.. The way, their friendship has been portrayed will leave an indelible mark on the audience for long time... You cannot imagine these two characters being donned by anyone else... In my opinion, they were the real heroes..

Ciarán Hinds as Julius Ceaser was amazing.. He carried his role effortlessly and with such a brilliance.. Lyndsey Marshal as Cleopatra was stunning.. Her mere presence ignites the frame to perfection... Boy, I was just carried away.. Such a beauty... James Purefoy as Mark Antony was portrayed brilliantly.. He justified his role more than anyone.. Awesome...

Even though, each episode has been directed by different people, they have been construed so well, that, the entire epic series is carried effortlessly... The continuity of thought has been maintained to perfection...

Brutus with his audacious voice was terrific... He was Brutus indeed...

My verdict: A perfect 10 on 10... Go ahead and watch the enigmatic series ever to be made... And be mesmerized like me... !!!"
"Concise but nevertheless extremely epic drama about two great leaders and two common soldiers captivates first and foremost by mere fact that it *indeed* happened. A simple reminder that ""these events really transpired"" is already a good reason to give Rome a try. Second good reason is commendable realism of the series.I can't defend or prosecute the plausibility of roman setting but I definitely like the character exposition, especially of the historical ones. Caesar is prudent, inspiring man, Octavian is smart yet extremely proud noble, Brutus is earnest idealist, Antony is talented decadent, Cleopatra is lascivious, ambitious queen... Writers and actors did fantastic job intertwining real with fiction in interesting and yet not contradicting manner. Second season falls a bit behind on that front due to the fact that performance of new Octavian does not match his supposed greatness. Nevertheless history is where Rome shines throughout both seasons.

Ironically (or rather consequently) all problems of Rome stems from everything that was *made up*. After all Rome is not about Caesar or Octavian, Rome is about Lucius Vorenus and Titus Pullo. ""The tale about two soldiers"" is archetype but to shape it into novelty and not into stereotype you got to be extremely well versed. I am biased towards liking their storyline in the first season simply because I liked Lucius Vorenus so much. His stoic lawful good attitude is admirable and uplifting. In what else realistic TV series can you find a character who has always been faithful to his wife? But such people *do* exist. But let me remove the bias and I can see that the other protagonist, Titus Pullo, is fine likeable character but a cheap trick: you will love him for the same reason you love loyal silly dog. And tale of two soldiers itself - littered with cliche movements (love and hate friendship, unfortunate coincidence, fall from goodness) or questionable developments (Vorenus family relationships, Pullo's dive into hitman job). The inward change of Vorenus in second season is most disappointing of them all.

Aside from Vorenus and Pullo there are other elements where writers' ideas went awry: Atia is annoying and hardly perceived as mother for such good children, Servilia plot is too long and overaccented, Octavia begins as symbol of purity and duty but ends up as resentful child for no reason.

Lastly a note to actions lovers, visiting from Vikings or Spartacus: Rome is not action at all, there are no battles or any kind of thrilling fights. Rome is about narration and story presented impeccably upon historical background."
"This show is honestly great. It is easily the best animation show I have seen in a while on any network. The second the show starts you can tell that the characters fit perfectly with each other, and involved with the craziness that happens in the universe with Rick and Morty, they are immediately hilarious and extremely creative at the same time. A couple episodes in and I could tell that this was a unique show, and that people need to be watching it because it has huge potential. And with Dan Harmon writing and directing at the helm of it all, the magic that this show brings is a rare gem in television that people need to watch.. So yeah I highly suggest this show to anyone who wants a true genuine laugh at least once a week."
"This is an extremely solid show. It is *dark*, but there are certainly moments that approach the limits of any sort of television style format.

The ending of ""Rick Potion #9"" is just amazing. Likewise, the end of ""M. Night Shaym Aliens"".

The strength of the show is just how amoral Rick may be; but there is a strong attachment to the ""many universes"" hypothesis within the show. Philosophers have long debated the moral implications of ""many universes"" ( while realizing it's a bit sophomoric and nerdy ) ; ""Rick and Morty"" picks at this as its stock in trade. Morty is our avatar, and works in that capacity extremely well.

The essential dyad at the center - the title characters - interact little with the more peripheral characters, who have mainly been used in B plots. This shifts of course, and with these sorts of shows they will always mix this for plot gain. There's a rich enough set of characters to provide ample space. The interaction between Rick and Morty hoists a bit from classic propaganda tropes without actually being propagandist; a heck of a trick. It must be hard to calibrate this.

The entire show is just chock full of nuggets and neither preaches nor deigns to condescend to the audience. Pacing is always even and feels right. The writers know where to push and where not to.

We will see how long this can be maintained. The writers show a gift for twisting & adding-to old plots into new shows. Hopefully that's a stable arrangement.

As an ""agent of Chaos"", Rick should serve us for many years. There are actual ideas underneath all the humor, and here's to them. This might well be the best thing on television right now."
"I've heard nothing but great things about Rick and Morty but still put off watching it for so long, I finally started it and boy am I glad I finally did. It's hilarious and original! My favorite animated series are Family Guy, Archer, Bojack Horsemen, shows like that and this is right there with them. It's definitely weird but in a good way, a way that will keep you laughing at every episode. You really become invested in it's world and characters like it's a thrilling drama, not an adult animated comedy. Each episode is funny, smart and weird. It's exactly what a science fiction comedy should be. Don't be like me and keep putting off...watch it, it really is as good as everyone says it is!"
"Rick and Morty is equally one of the most influential pieces of entertainment in the 2010's decade while also creating one of the most insufferable fan bases out of any media in that time, as well.

The premise for the show is one of the most distilled versions of Postmodern ideology that you really can find - there's no real point to anything, objectivity goes right out the window, so might as well do whatever you want while you can.

At its best, this show goes off the rails with (not so subtle) references to other pieces of culture that mixes a push to make fun of the very things that they're referencing. At its worst, it's patronizing and self-referential in a way that's been the catalyst to create some of the egotistical fanbases that it now has.

However, for all that's been said about this show (the good and the bad), that's precisely what has driven its ethos for 7 seasons (and more) - ""we can make fun of whatever we want to and do whatever we want to because what you love doesn't actually matter. You and I are both going to die one day.""

I love this show for many reasons. Top of the list being - what they make fun of, I also understand and love as well. From Ice T, to Birdperson, to the council of the Rick's, and the commercial for Two Brothers, this show has no problem letting its imagination drive the engine in fresh, new ways while being wholly unoriginal most of the time (and better for it)."
"Send help! I rewatched this 5 times already and it's still amazing, and I never rewatch anything."
"Rick and Morty is a hilarious new show by the genius behind Community seasons 1-3 and 5, Dan Harmon. The episodes so far have always seemed fresh and the writing is hilarious and creative. But then there's no surprise really since its co-creator created Community.

The hilarious mixture of wittiness, slapstick and action all add to making this show one of the best cartoons I have ever seen.

From what I've seen so far, the show easily parodies different movies and topics, also slyly sneaking in references (sometimes not slyly).

The art also is simple, but very appealing. Because the show is animated, Dan Harmon, Justin Roiland and the writers have been able to break free from the chains of live action, making the show more out of this world.

I highly recommend this show to anyone, especially fans of the Regular Show, Adventure Time and Community."
"There's not just one thing I love about this show, everything that goes into the show, how the creators treat their fans, to the characters created, to the writing, everything what makes this what it is I love."
"10/10 Rick: Listen, Morty, I hate to break it to you, but what people call ""love"" is just a chemical reaction that compels animals to breed. It hits hard, Morty, then it slowly fades, leaving you stranded in a failing marriage. I did it. Your parents are gonna do it."
"Heads Up: This review is based on the first few episodes of Season 1 only. I was really looking forward to Rick and Morty based on the hilarious teaser and the fact that this is a hand drawn show like older, more classic cartoons. My concern was that it would end up with a weak, poorly written script. That is not the case whatsoever. This show is incredibly original with its writing, characters, style and imagination. Every episode AND joke is completely different from the last, which keeps this show fresh and exciting to watch. While I think Rick (the grandpa) is the funniest, No character is bad. Morty, his dog Snuffles, and even Morty's math teacher all pack in great jokes. The directing is great and the art style and the way it is drawn is really really good. The only problem I have with the show, is that I don't really think they know how to end each episode (so far at least). But, this is truly a breath of fresh air when it comes to comedy, and I think adultswim has a really good show on their hands... 9/10"
"To me, Rick and Morty absolutely wasn't love at first sight. The concept instinctively didn't make sense to me, at first. A grandpa and his grandson. What I loved from the start was the adventurous alternate universes, and the potential in my imagination. This show could go anywhere. What really stuck was a couple of alternate universes that really touched my heart. I didn't expect that. And I would have settled for less. The jokes by themselves are hilarious, already. All main characters have proper personalities, unseen to date. The show didn't go for 'smooth.' Maybe, you have to go for something else to achieve 'smooth.' You can't aim for smooth, but that's the only thing, I can think of, that falls short of a 10. A ""Captain-America-smooth."" Maybe the last thing that's missing is a shield ? Naw. But all those adventures need to start standing for something. Even if Grandpa Rick is just chasing that kind of over-arching ... thing."
"Sad to see such a great show die, but no king rules forever (my son). 4 bad episodes in a row now. They feel so unnatural, forced. It's like the writers changed completely, not the voice actor. If I didn't know Roiland was swapped for somebody else I woudn't have noticed by just voices alone. But voices aside, the writing is irredeemable. A show that had such great episodes in the earlier seasons that it had infinite rewatchability, has come to this.

Other episodes of the season were bad as well, with varying degrees. But the last one (s07e04) had no funny moment. At all. Simply no witty dialogue. No cool story. Instead of absurd scenes, where the whole setting is funny to begin with, it's just shock value.

In the earlier seasons it was maybe 1 (one) bad episode per season. Right now we are looking at 1 (one) GOOD episode per season, optimistically. It is well and truly over.

Despite a few cringe episodes in the earlier seasons, that I wrote off as nonexistant in my headcanon , this was at one point my favourite TV show. Now turned mediocre. At this point I'd rather just watch Family Guy and South Park. Despite both shows being past their prime, at least there is some ""in your face"" humor to be found there. All that's left in Rick and Morty is a lame, unfunny regurgitation of the things we've seen or a subpar social commentary.

""Morty, I discovered suicide. It's when you die by killing yourself, Morty. And we're gonna make it an episode. Season 9 more seasons of Rick and Morty for 97 more years"" 10 for the first few season and 1 for the latest instalments, with average rounded down to 5 . Adios."
"Let me just say that I was very skeptical about this show. Judging from the sneak peaks and previews, I assumed this was going to be just another family guy/ Brikleberry lazily animated show with some cheap and low standards. Well gee wizz, I was very very wrong! Rick and Morty might seem like some stupid knock off of Back to the Future or some money laundering scheme as part of late night cable TV, but its not. Behind all the jokes, each episode surprisingly has a strong message and whether you can relate to it or not, you won't really feel like the end of each episode was a bummer.

The weakest aspect is the animation. Its not pretty and seems out dated. Despite this, its hard to say that this pulls the show down. No, not even one bit. The absolutely clever writing and well designed character personalities are basically what this show floats upon.

Unlike many other cartoons that have a sub plot in every episode, the ones in this show are actually relevant and memorable. They aren't just there as fillers and they are nearly as important as the main story. In fact, in most episodes its hard to tell which one is the sub plot and which one is the main plot.

What I'm trying to say is that this show is near perfect. What are you still doing watching new Simpsons and Family guy, go watch this show if you haven't already. Its a great example of how TV hasn't turned to total crap."
I absolutely love this show... Reminds me of the chemistry of Doc and Marty Mcfly from the Back to the Future series with a rated R twist. Slowly but surely the are tweaking character development. Getting better every new episode!!! I like the way Rick is always drinking and burping and slurring his speech. This show is getting a lot of acclaim with so few episodes and it deserves every bit. Honestly this is the best cartoons aimed at young adults and teens that I've seen in a years. I always get excited when I see a new episode trailer!!! Can't wait to see what direction they take this to in the future. They have set it up for literally limitless possibilities.
"I just finished watching the first three episodes and feel instantly hooked. I have the same feeling I had when I watched Family Guy for the first time, in which I felt like every single character was interesting and was contributing for the series in their own ways. In this show, things that will make you laugh are dark and awkward at times which succeed every time. I haven't found a single bad moment so far in the first three episodes and can't wait to watch the whole thing

The first episode was awesome and got me straight to the next. The dog world domination episode is going to be a classic, go watch it. People will remember that episode."
"Rick and Morty is a very funny show. The humor is crazy and is hurled at the audience with breathless speed. Every joke doesn't hit, but there are so many of them that it hardly matters, and when they do hit, they hit hard.

That makes it a good show, but what makes it a truly great series is the intelligence of the crazy sci-fi ideas that fuel the stories. Yes, a miniverse inside a miniverse inside a miniverse is ridiculous, but it's also wonderfully ingenious, especially as you see both the variety and consistency of these worlds. A being that insinuates itself into everyone's memories was beautifully done. An episode in which your mind can create your concept of your partner was smart from the beginning, but then kept expanding on the idea.

Every idea is nonsensical, but every idea is ingenious and fully explored. This is not just good comedy, it's good sci-fi.

I wish this show had lasted as long as the Simpsons (i.e. forever) but what there is is fantastic."
"I find the Rick and Morty series are good to watch in the background, and jump in at any moment. Even though there is a story to follow in the lore throughout the episodes and seasons, it isn't 100% necessary to watch them in order and to know what is going on. This is because each of the episodes follow a short story/adventure that mainly follows Rick and Morty however sometimes there will be a combination of characters in the adventure.

I enjoy thé creativity of the show, as the premise of the show follows Rick, a Scientific genius who developed portal travel and other interesting Si-Fi gadgets, and because of this, anything can happen and the stories can run wild. I have watched this a few times however I find that I always like the very different adventures from episode to episode.

One thing that is seen underlying in the show which I think is done very well is the character development and their interaction with one another. From Beth and Jerry's failing marriage to Ricks sense of depression, pushing people away and loneliness. This sort of character lore provides something a bit extra for the viewer and sometimes can allow some relation between the characters and the viewer."
"Scratch that. This may be the best Cartoon Network show period! Yeah, you don't normally group Adult Swim shows with other ones, but as someone who watches both, this is freaking awesome! The funniest thing is how I was introduced to this series. I was actually recommended by a friend at work to see it. I looked here on the IMDb and found out it had the highest rating of any animated show (not including anime) that I'd ever seen! And you know what? I think it completely deserves it.

Apart from having good animation, the characters and stories in this show are just so freaking fun. Every single character is dysfunctional in some way, but never to the point where they're unlikeable. Rick of course steals the show. I believe it when I hear that Rick represents a cynical part of our personalities and Morty is the idealistic one. The fact that both of these characters are voiced by Justin Roiland makes it all the more obvious. I keep expecting Morty to say ""Unacceptable!"" at any time. I kept wondering who this guy was and why I kept hearing him in every cartoon I was watching.

I have yet to find a single episode of this show I didn't like. Then again, the show hasn't gone on that long and I haven't seen all the episodes. I think my favorite is probably ""Lawnmower Dogs"". The two plots are so good and hilarious. Anything with Scary Terry is amusing. What sets this apart from lesser shows like ""Family Guy"" is that this show does work so much harder to make you laugh and doesn't try to just gross you out. It really does focus on character development and takes time to make jokes relevant to the story. It's still not quite as good as ""South Park"" but it's fairly close in terms of adult cartoons. I think my former favorite Adult Swim show was ""Robot Chicken"" or perhaps ""The Venture Bros."".

There's quite a lot of variety in Rick and Morty's adventures. There's quite a bit of creativity. There even are some truly heartwarming moments. I can always count on this to make me laugh or entertain me in any way. This just succeeds where so many adult cartoons have failed as they try to hard to be obscene or just aren't funny. The plot? Well, not really much except Rick travels through space and other dimensions with his grandson, Morty. The vocal range is great and it's nice and colorful.

Watch this show and laugh like mad. Perfect ****!"
"I have recently become a fan of this fascinating anime I think this was the best animation I have seen in the last few years!

This animation shines in every episode! Each episode is a strange and interesting adventure But honestly, if you spend at least twenty minutes of your time watching this animation every day, of course! If you look at it as temporary entertainment, you'll definitely be satisfied, but if you want to watch it as an animation with a fixed and determined theme, I don't think you'll be satisfied.

But it actually makes me happy to know that there are other parts of it that I haven't seen yet!

This encourages me a lot to support And also to say that my favorite character is Rick!"
"The show feels fidgety in the beginning. At first it makes you take a second to get used and into it. But it's as intelligent and hilarious a show as I haven't seen one since a long time! That's what I and hopeful many other viewers are going to realize after a couple of minutes. It'S one of those shows that wouldn't happen to be without Adult Swim. Not exactly a family show. Anyways - this show is brilliant. The humor is not as cheap as in most of the successful cartoons and the show is not as comfortable to watch, but that's one thing that makes it so hilarious. It's really dark sometimes, and the viewer with a good sense of humor will appreciate that. The only thing that might make the show a bit better is that the creators could make the characters a bit better known and thus more likable to the viewer. Like this a plot as in episode 6 (SE1) would work even better. Well, the characters maybe a bit flat still, but the plots and happenings are making all this acceptable. Amazingly funny and thoughtful story line for a 20min cartoon show. The sad part is, that it might not really be for the rank and file and as a result might not last for too long or even be recognized by too many people. I really hope this goes on for a while, though! I love this show - it's great. Keep up the good work

PS.: I hope they take one or two scientists on board to help them with Grandpa Rick to keep him on track regarding scientific accuracy. But that'S just a personnel tic of mine..."
"""Oh geeez, man."" I 100% agree with the reviews that say seasons 1-3 are amazing and anything after that is a tough watch.

Don't get me wrong, there are some great episodes sprinkled into seasons 4-5, but they are too few and far between to make the show really worth sticking with.

Season 6 was tough. Season 7 was nearly impossible to finish and I don't feel confident about the series moving forward.

I wouldn't recommend keeping a subscription to pay for this show. Wait until all eps are free at this point, imo.

The show lost its heart and soul and in the words of Rick himself, ""It's a joyless cash grab.""

RIP Rick and Morty 😢."
"If you look at timeline for the writers you can see all the writers from season 1-3 are gone. These new writers are very formulaic. They think ""this is what a Rick and Morty show must have in it"". Originality is gone. Also the new writers are trying to make this into a Simpsons/Family Guy cartoon with all the family.

First three seasons are wonderful and you can watch them over and over. Season 4 and 5, are tolerable enough to watch once.

I would strongly suggest they get back the old writers. Also cut back on having the family in the show. It's making the show Simpsons with crude jokes."
"Awesome!!!! Just plain fantastic! Just what we've been waiting for! At a loss for words!! Thank You God! It's about time that writers have opened up to ideas from a new realm! This is it! No hold bars, out of this world, other dimensions, straight in your face! Brilliant! I can't wait to see more! I have to see more! There better be more; it would be pretty ugly, otherwise! Hawt-dam! Yee-Freaking-Haa! Sit down, strap in, hold on and be amazed! Super clever, great story lines, great visuals, smooth, exciting, thought provoking works of art; absolute masterpieces! I applaud the writers and commend them for their brilliance and am so excited this is happening! Rick and Morty FOREVER!!!"
"This is absolutely one of those out-of-the-box, quick-witted, clever, hilarious, sometimes VERY weird and sometimes VERY dark sci-fi animation adult comedy shows that has graced late night screens in recent years.

I know fans of this show that range in ages from 17 to 72 that watch it religiously.

This show has SERIOUS fans, and I see why. Like other comparable shows like Family Guy or South Park, this is absolute brilliant animation comedy that is meant to not only beg your attention by being so fast-talking, but also because it has a deeper underlying message that will make sense in whatever it means to you. Brilliant.

Keep it comin'."
"There were only 11 episodes in the first season, so it seems a little premature and overenthusiastic to call this the funniest and best show on television, but I'm tossing it out there anyway.

Too much of the Adult Swim programming is mean-spirited and ugly, but ""Rick & Morty"" balances its cynicism with moments of genuine familial and societal warmth. The characters are well-developed and evolve over the course of the season, and the voice talent is gifted -- Chris Parnell is the secret weapon as Morty's not-too-bright dad.

The Pilot is the only episode I was Luke-warm on, because it's the only one where the nastiness overwhelms everything else, but it fits well into the course of the entire season because it gives the bitter alcoholic grandfather Rick something to grow away from, and the first year gets better and better as it rolls along.

There isn't a lot of TV I can watch with my son, but this is just about the best of it. Can't wait for season 2, and I hope there will be more than 11 episodes."
Homeland was such a smart and interesting show. It started following the story of Sgt. Nicholas Brody (Damian Lewis) who returns home a hero following eight years in captivity. Bipolar CIA agent Carrie Mathison (Claire Danes) thinks he has turned and wants to commit a terrorist act on American soil. Every season follows Carrie as she tries to prevent terrorists from carrying out their plots. I loved the entire series but have to admit that the last few seasons of Homeland have gone down a little in quality. They're still pretty good as long as you don't compare them to the first few seasons. I really can't recommend this show enough.
The last few seasons of Homeland were not quite as good as the earlier ones and but I still gave it an 8/10 because the first 4 or 5 seasons were so good and was one of the best shows on TV during those seasons! The ending was also great and we all know how hard it is to end a good show with a good ending! I really do miss this show!
Claire danes gives in my opinion one of the best performances in entertainment history. Carrie mathison is probably the most polarizing protagonist I have seen yet. I find it amusing how fans can hate her so much but continue watching when the show is so much about carrie.. especially in later seasons when she really becomes the focus. Personally I love carrie.. i find claire danes intensity really impressive and I actually am anxious watching her. Carrie's crying does not bother me. I actually think it makes complete sense. Part of bipolar disorder is having those strong emotions and to some that may seem exaggerated but I think it fits her character being a bipolar CIA spy .. thats gotta be one of the most stressful jobs to exist. Of course thats not the case for everyone but it makes sense for carrie. Homeland is a very tense show and I can understand it's not for everyone. Horror is my favorite genre but I find this show about terrorism scarier than most any horror. It is probably the most depressing show I've seen.. honestly it could have used some occasional comedic relief. I really don't know anything about the CIA and this is the first show/movie in the spy genre I've watched so I really can't speak on how realistic this series is but i'm guessing it isn't always and they probably exaggerate some stuff for entertainment. I'm middle eastern and I appreciate that this show doesn't seem to take sides to show not everything is so black and white. The american side and CIA are shown to be corrupt as well. Danes portrayal of bipolar disorder is shocking and sometimes seems too real to be acting. I probably would not have watched this show with out her and I can't wait to see what she does next.
Today I watched the last Episode of Homeland. All I can say is just thank you to the whole Cast for one of the best TV Shows I've ever watched. I'm so sad it's over now but it's a good feeling sadness because the ending of that was just PERFECT!
Season 8 is just amazing!! A deserving end to the series which has captured our hearts for the last 10 years. I thought after season 5 homeland had become like one of those Emmy winning series which are forgotten after 4-5 season and no one cares about watching it. But I have been a dedicated fan and stuck till the end and I'm so glad I didn't stop watching it. This post is for all those viewers who thought Carrie has lost her touch... No she hasn't!! Please finish this series for her sake. This last season reminds me of the tension and stress that I felt while watching season 1&2
"So sad to see eight years come to a close, but what a close it was! I want to thank the entire cast, writers, production, and post production crews for putting together such a fab series."
"I started watching Series 01 only in 2023, although I new that it was a very good one. And really it is. I finished the first series in 3 days, and so on with the following ones. Of course it's a fiction, but it's very intense, very exciting and gripping, you can't leave it on. Claire Danes performance is more than fantastic, she is a superb actor, she should have more roles in other movies.

The other fantastic actor is Rupert Friend / Peter Quinn. They should make a prequel or other series with him: Quinn. A Bond/Wick kind of person, lethal like a cobra, invincible like the Terminator, and having a charisma and charme like James Bond. It would have succes, in my opinion.

Homeland is a complex series that it shouldn't be missed by those who like current affairs and exciting action films."
What an amazing end to a great series and talented cast! I am in shock and saddened to see the series end with Season 8 but it was enjoyable and very well executed from Season1 episode 1 until Season 8 episode 12. Wonderfully done! I loved it! A++++++
"Amazing actor and probably one of the coolest characters I've seen in a long time in any series.

Rupert Friend is equipped with the weirdest and coolest charisma and he fits the role extremely well. I wish I'll soon witness him in similar roles in movies or series, where ever, please. Otherwise I'll just have to watch couple of seasons again.

I wish he would have stayed in this series till the end. No spoilers here, you can see it clearly from IMDb that he is not acting in every episode. This is something the people writing this series could have written some other way.

Yeah, the series is ok otherwise as well, but without him it's like food without salt or pepper, both."
"This show is brilliant and gets better with each season. I'm now on season 4, it is even better than the previous seasons. Claire's acting is so top notch that you cant help but forgive the creators for the unnecessary teenage drama on the first two seasons.

Claire Danes doesnt receive the credit she deserves."
"You hear a lot about Breaking Bad, Sopranos and Game of Thrones, but Homeland is one of the most underrated and lesser known in the league of 'greatest series of all time'.

The show has some of the best acting, production and storytelling around. And although the underlying narrative is espionage and counterterrorism, it will take you on a ride through a whole range of emotions from elation to despair, sorrow and frustration.

The acting of Claire Danes has been said to be so realistic that people questioned whether she really was bipolar, Meanwhile she is supported by Mandy Patinkin and Rupert Friend who also feel like lead actors most of the time.

Each season gets deep into its topic in full grit and realism, leaving you convinced that the events could actually take place in real life. I've a very analytical person and tend to scrutinise shows to the enth degree but with Homeland I left my analytical mind at the door because it was so believable.

Before Homeland came along I felt that 24 with Jack Bauer was realistic, but Homeland makes 24 look like the Barbie movie.

Can't recommend this enough to anyone interested in quality shows."
"Just watched the last episode of the series, which was a perfect ending to an amazing show! So current and realistic... There are no good guys and bad guys, just different, selfish agendas. Thanks to everyone involved in the creation od such an excellent series!!"
"It goes beyond my comprehension that people hate this show. They must all be American brainwashed patriots. Seriously get over it, it's just a show and it's a good one. I absolutely love this show, the actors are all very believable in their roles, the storyline is exceptional, full of twists that keeps you on the edge of your seat during the whole show. At the end of every episode I already want to watch the next one as soon as possible. Everything that you think happens in real life when you think about CIA, espionage, terrorists and so on passes the register. Conspiracies, paranoia, double-crossing, betrayal, false promises etc. Clair Danes puts down a brilliant performance playing an unstable CIA analyst. To me the whole series is full of action and suspense. One of the best series!"
The series started so nice and until the 5th season was pretty good. You had thrill and action and drama ... but season 6 ... omg no!!! And also for the love of god ... please can we stop seeing Claire Danes crying in every single episode almost ????
"If you wanted to see a gripping thriller with incredible characters, you have come to the perfect place. 'Homeland' is the new Showtime Drama that entertains you throughout and never lets you go, thus succeeding in slipping in some really unexpected twists in the plot. With writers who've previously written for '24', the show does look inspired when it comes to keeping the audience in the dark.

The show is blessed with a small but amazing cast whose performance is worth every penny. Claire Danes plays an intense CIA analyst who believes that recently recovered P.O.W. (Damian Lewis) is plotting to attack America. Her character is unstable and makes it hard for the audience to believe her which adds to the beauty of the script. Damian Lewis, on the other hand, plays the 'guy in uniform' with ease as he did splendidly in 'Band of Brothers'. The show hasn't revealed much about Damian's character and I have a feeling they wouldn't do that any time soon, since it keeps the suspense going.

The pilot was top-notch and certainly the best that premiered this fall. If the show continues to be intriguing and maintains the high quality of the pilot, it can surely be a genius.

10 stars at least for now."
"The first five seasons are worthwhile, some better than others, but 6 and 7 are preposterous and insulting to one's intelligence. Showtime has a great track record of trying to milk their programs dry and this is no exception. I think it's time to take this one out back and plant it in the dirt."
Band of Brothers absolutely one of the best miniseries of all-time...period. Not only that but it's also among the very best war movies/tv shows ever created! It follows the story of a US Army airborne division called Easy Company and their missions in Europe during World War II. It follows the brave soldiers and their experiences and bravery during the war. It's based off interviews with survivors of Easy Company and the soldiers letters and journals they wrote. EVERY episode is so incredibly written and the cast is absolutely amazing! It is a pulse-pounding accurate depiction of war that will keep you glued to each and every episode. I have to warn you that it's a tough watch but absolutely worth it.
"Band of Brothers is the best Movie/Mega Mini series that has ever been made. It has all the production quality of Saving Private Ryan but with many more layers of plot and characters. I can't wait for the what has to be a gigantic DVD collection, just hope it is under $200!!! Thanks HBO!!!!!!!"
"I have read virtually all of Ambrose's WWII books, and this mini-series faithfully follows one of his best. The experience of these men of the 506th Parachute Infantry Regiment, 101st Airborne, was mirrored throughout the many divisions of Army and Marine ground troops in WWII. I feel that this series represents that collective experience in the finest, most forthright manner possible and pays tribute to them all. The acting, mostly by previously unheralded actors, was superb--particularly that of Damien Lewis (Capt.Winters). Winters had to mature along with his increasing command responsibilites, had to learn to turn over his initial company-level responsibilities to others as he was promoted to battalion commander. It was clearly tough for him, particularly when he had to order attacks on heavily defended objectives, without being to lead his former command directly. All of the characters were developed enough that you cared about each of them as individuals, and felt the loss of each of them through the attrition during the brutal fighting in the Northern European Theater. They cared for each other as fighting men do (confirmed by my own experience in the infantry in Vietnam), but at the same time they had to carry on with the mission regardless of loss. Replacements are regarded warily at first, but then managed to blend in with the veterans if they showed they were worthy of joining this band of brothers. The plot is real, and as such is neither macho nor macabre--it just is presented as it really happened. The truths of combat are stranger than fiction. The interviews with the actual veterans, interspersed throughout the series, added authenticity, verified what the series was showing. These representatives of ""The Greatest Generation"" did themselves and this nation proud. Though I knew the story well, I eagerly looked for to each new episode to see how well it tracked with the book and how well the actors and director portrayed it. Up to this series, I had thought that ""Once an Eagle"" (starring Sam Elliot) was the best war series, but this one is now at the top of the class in my view."
"I am an 80 year old combat veteran (88th Inf. Div. Italy).

I watched BOB on the History Channel. I was so overwhelmed, indeed a bit panicked by the authentic nature of 90+% of the uniforms, signs, noises (I take exception to the sound of incoming artillery).

I cried several times at the authentic staging - for them and me.

I cannot believe I'll watch it again. It's too much. Too real.

We never had so much water allowed in a shower.

"This week I saw three things based on WW-II novels. The first was 'The Pianist' about the Warsaw ghetto in the war and the survival of a Jewish pianist in that ghetto. The second was 'De Tweeling', a Dutch film about two twin-sisters, separated in 1926. One of them grows up in Nazi-Germany, the other in The Netherlands. That movie shows us more of the common persons during the war, Germans and not-Germans. The third was 'Band of Brothers', a true story about combat in the war. All three things are great, the films I mean, and you definitely should see all three of them.

'Band of Brothers' follows Easy-company from their training in England, through D-Day, the rest of France (including Bastogne), Holland (including operation Market Garden), Germany and Austria. This story is shown to us in ten different episodes. Every episode starts with the real men from Easy-company telling about their experiences and ends with a short written update of Easy-company. Between beginning and ending of episodes one of the best things I have seen on screen is presented to us.

The casting is amazing. Even David Schwimmer (from 'Friends') as the bitter Captain Sobel is great. Damian Lewis and Ron Livingston are superb as Major Winters and Captain Lewis Nixon. Every actor seems to be perfect for his character. The photography and direction is great also. I especially loved the direction of the episode done by executive producer Tom Hanks, possibly with some help from the other executive producer Steven Spielberg. 'Saving Private Ryan' was great for showing us the horror in combat, 'Band of Brothers' does the same thing but adds some other things. You really learn to know the characters (in 600 minutes you can do that), you sympathize with them.

If you have the chance to see this masterpiece, do so. It is long but you can spread the episodes over some days. But if you start watching it is very hard to stop. Definitely one of the best WW-II movies or series out there."
"Band of Brothers finds us following the exploits of Easy Company throughout their campaign in Europe, from their inception all the way to the end of the war. The commentary from the actual soldiers that were in those situations is touching, to say the very least. These commentaries also help to move the character development along quite a bit, as it lets us into their own personal thoughts on the situations they faced. This project, to the best of my knowledge was undertaken at roughly the same time as Saving Private Ryan, using many of the same locations and also employing DreamWorks special effects, giving it a very familiar feel for anyone that has seen Private Ryan. As I've already touched on, the character development is greatly due to the fact that this story is not told in a two hour segment, but throughout several hour long intervals, giving us the chance to truly ""get to know"" the characters personalities as the story develops. In my humble opinion, the only other military type mini series' that even come close to the scope of this one are The Blue and The Grey, and North and South.

All of the actors in this series do and excellent job at playing the roles appropriately and making us believe the hell these men were put through. The thing I also appreciated about the cast is the lack of any ""real"" names, leading to us not knowing who may or may not be making it out the scenes alive and unscathed.

This mini series is everything Saving Private Ryan was, as well as everything it wasn't. If you're a fan of war time stories and ""army"" movies, this is hands down the best of the best I don't even think I could name ANY movies about WWII that could even compare to this one A bold statement, I know, but I'm making it any how."
"There aren't much TV-series which have left such an impression on me as Band of Brothers did. From the moment I saw the first episodes, I knew I had to buy this on DVD.

This series, telling you the story of Easy Company of the US Army Airbourne Paratrooper division is so unbelievably realistic, so authentic... There has been put so much effort in taking care of all the details that it makes you believe that you are right in the middle of all the action. This is an outstanding achievement. It's about ten hours long, but I wouldn't mind if it was a few hours longer.

Each episode opens with interviews with several of the actual men from Easy Company, talking about some of the experiences that that episode deals with. When you buy the special edition DVD box (a metal case with 6 instead of 5 DVD's), you will find the complete interviews with these men on the extra DVD. These interviews certainly aren't to be missed!

As you may have guessed, I'm one of the biggest fans of this series. I could go on for hours about it, but our time is limited and instead of reading this you better watch the series yourself. According to me, there is only one score appropriate for a masterpiece like this one and that is 10/10. Amazing!!!!"
Band of Brothers absolutely one of the best miniseries of all-time...period. Not only that but it's also among the very best war movies/tv shows ever created! EVERY episode is so incredibly written and the cast is absolutely amazing! It is a pulse-pounding accurate depiction of war that will keep you glued to each and every episode.
"Band of Brothers shows the world the ugly truth of World War II.

As it was a TV series, sometimes people may think that there are movies of the same quality, but honestly, I didn't find.

The characters are presented very deeply and we can even feel what they are going through and the problems they are facing.

At times, distressing. Others, exciting.

I believe that as it was based on real facts and having testimonials from people who have gone through the war, Band of Brothers becomes unforgettable."
"""Band of Brothers"" in a word is awesome. I couldn't wait to see each episode. Co-Executive Produced by Tom Hanks and Steven Spielberg, it has the realism, look and feel of Spielberg's ""Saving Private Ryan"" (1998) but with more insight into the characters. Hanks even directed one episode himself.

Told over ten gut wrenching episodes, the story centers on a company of soldiers in the 101st American Airborne Division in WWII from their initial basic training to their landing in France on D-Day to their many battles and ordeals through to the liberation of a concentration camp and finally through to the end of the war.

The soldiers are ordinary people thrust into horrific situations and shows how each is able (or not able) to deal with the situations. The battle scenes are realistic and convincing and the special effects are breath taking. While the series depicts the trials and tribulations of the company, it isn't afraid to show how the war affects seemingly sane and rational men. For example there is a scene where the nominal hero of the story, Winters (Damien Lewis) shoots an unarmed German soldier out of frustration. There is also a scene where a group of German prisoners are cut down by an American officer after he had given them cigarettes. Even after the German surrender there are instances of out and out murder of Germans. This is very rare for an American war story.

The cast is of largely unknown actors, which makes for a more effective telling of the story. There is no John Wayne leading the troops to victory kind of thing. Damien Lewis is very good as Winters who rises through the ranks to lead the company. Ron Livingston plays his friend and second in command, Nixon. Others include David Schwimmer, excellent as the training officer, Scott Grimes as Malarkey the grizzled sergeant and ex New Boys on the Block member Donnie Wahlberg effective as Corporal Lipton.

""Band of Brothers"" is a story that could only be told in a mini-series. It clearly shows that war really is hell."
"I absolutely love this miniseries.

As a keen amateur historian, I got sick and tired of books and documentaries about the great leaders, politics, geography and basically, the non-bloodshed parts of WW2.

Similarly virtually every time I saw a war movie, it was ruined by flashbacks( thin red line) ridiculous fiction (and yes, i do mean you, The Bunker) or completely unnecessary and out of place sex scenes (who can forget Enemy At The Gates, a powerful film, until that awful sex scene which ruined the whole thing?)

There are good war movies. But this stands out, because not only is there no fiction whatsoever, but because, as a miniseries, more time is available to get to know the characters, and follow their progress, to know them, to love them, to mourn them.

Time allows for detail, and the fact that the 'frills' that other films stick in to make them more viewer friendly and marketable have been left out....

When a character in BoB dies, you mourn not because a flashback tells you they have a young sweetheart or something...but because you know this is real, it happened. The acting is truly superb, and you realise, it isn't a character you are mourning at all, it's a real person. This is because the actors made very strong relationships with their real life surviving counterparts, they knew their roles inside out and it really does show. We feel so strongly for the characters because the actors have portrayed them so faithfully. There are no clichés, because the truth is so accurately reproduced.

After reading Ambrose's book, you realise how religiously each part of the series is portrayed.

The sets are perfect, the effects remarkable, and Michael Kamens score will go down as one of the finest ever written. Everything about the production of this series is phenomenal, the details are so minute yet so important.

This should be watched not just for entertainment value, but as a reminder of the sacrifices made for us.

Easily the best television series ever produced.

Watch it. Now."
"""Band of Brothers"" is a nearly 12 hour long show about the experiences of a group of soldiers during their tour of duty in Europe during WWII. Given that it is this long, it allows so much more in the way of character development and story telling than a typical war movie. The closest thing to this quality-wise is the original version of ""Das Boot""--as it was a mini-series and was later spliced apart to make it a motion picture. But even then, the German submarine film was only about 40% as long and never got into the detail and had quite the emotional impact as ""Band of Brothers"". In every way, the show screams quality--with amazing sets, details and direction. In fact, while the budget for this was large ($125,000,000 according to IMDb), it was actually pretty small considering the number of actors, the amazing sets and the length of the series. This is a must-see for anyone and I would say more and heap more praise on the film except that there are already hundreds and hundreds of other reviews on IMDb that pretty much do that already."
"I understand why ppl rate it so high, but imo this show is aimed mostly to american audience to bring up patriotic feelings and high emotions, as an european i cant really get into it. A very nice ww2 series in general but not a 9.5 for me."
"Lots of people applaud this series for its realism, but I can't really agree. I think there is still too way much Hollywood here and a lot of the scenes are cliché. The Germans are almost without exception behaving as total amateurs. For example, in the Crossroads episode they let themselves be completely surprised by the American attack in the rear, and in response they go running round in the open like a bunch of headless chickens to be shot down in droves. Yet we are told that these are SS soldiers. The SS was a crack unit and I don't believe that they were such poor soldiers to let this happen to them. One of the first things you get taught in tactical school is to secure your perimeter and set guards in all directions.

The American side too made huge blunders, if we accept this to be a realistic depiction of what happened in reality. Take the attack on the village of Foy (another place where we constantly see crowds of Germans nervously running around in the open for no apparent reason). The Americans knew that the Germans had artillery and tanks there, yet they assault the village with less than one Company of infantry without any attempt to soften up the defenders first! What are they thinking? Where was the Air Force? Couldn't they bomb the village first? Where was the American artillery? Couldn't they lay a barrage on the village before the attack? Why not use smoke grenades to give themselves some cover when they crossed the open fields? And we are supposed to feel sorry for the guys that their attack got bogged down?

Also very unrealistic is the layout of the opposing sides in the Last Patrol episode. If you believe this, the lines were less than hundred meters apart, yet on both sides people were walking around right in the open, and exposing themselves at the windows etc. At night they show some huge spotlights on the German side - surely those would be immediate targets given that they only appear to be a couple of hundred meters away from the Americans and plainly visible? Ridiculous! The behaviour of the Americans during the shelling in the Bastogne wood is equally unrealistic. Why are they all walking around in the open and talking to each other if they were so close to the German lines and expecting to come under fire? They should have been sitting in their foxholes, observing the enemy, not walking around chatting as if they were taking a stroll in the park! And then when the first shells explode why are some of them running round like idiots, shouting to the others to take cover? Don't you think that these D-day veterans would know by now to take cover when the shells start flying? All this kind of stuff that is only designed to get us excited and rooting for the characters is typical Hollywood nonsense. Never mind the decent acting, the good costumes and props, the camera-work - if the overall behaviour of the characters is quite unbelievable the entire story falls flat on its face. I am still waiting for the first truly realistic depiction of front-line combat - but I don't think I will ever get to see it, because in reality it isn't very photogenic so it wouldn't sell."
"As near to perfection as a TV Series can be, I cannot put into words the gravity & importance of this series.

A true, accurate, beautiful, and brutal portrayal of war. Nothing compares in the modern age, if ever.

Episode 9 is so emotionally draining it is very hard to watch at times, but watch it you must.

Never Again must we let this happen. Never, ever, ever again.

From a UK viewer, my heart, soul and tears are with every allied veteran, and every jewish person (and others) tortured and murdered by the Nazi regime.

This is the best, Chernobyl second best."
"I was a little hesitant to watch this miniseries because i'm not too fond of war movies, but this one was amazing! The acting was amazing, as well as the quality of picture. It was made to look like it was back in the 40's. It's not in black and white, but it has that older look. The actors, mostly British, are absolutely amazing. You really feel like you are there with them participating in the battles, feeling the pain of losing a comrade, and the fear of the battle. It starts with the basic training in Toccoa,Ga, and continues through Normandy, The battle of the Bulge, and Operation Market Garden, among others, as well as the liberation of a concentration camp. If you liked Saving Private Ryan, or even if you didn't, you will definitely love this miniseries!! Once again, Tom Hanks and Steven Spielberg created a masterpiece!"
"After 20 years it remains rightfully one of the highest rated things on IMDB. This is because it taps into the darkest days of the 20th century from which the greatest sacrifices were made, and the greatest heroes were forged. They simply wouldn't make BoB this way anymore and it wouldn't be as significant. Because 20 years age, most of us still had parents and grandparents who were still alive who had fought in or experienced WW2. So it was very much still real and close to all of us. 20 years later it is now almost entirely part of history books as opposed to being something we can still feel. Band of Brothers immortalised a number of ordinary but inspirational men and their stories, which were a microcosm for the stories of the millions of people and families around the globe and their experiences in humanity's darkest days. It would also be too political and careful if it were made these days. Because enough distance has passed people now for people to feel comfortable enough to criticise what happened as seen from a modern perspective and may even try to denigrate or change the narrative to serve their delusions or agenda. Because they no longer have to look into the eyes of the ordinary men and women who had to do terrible things and make terrible sacrifices being thrust into scenarios they did not create. So a series like Band of Brothers will never and could never be made again, so treasure it."
This is an incredibly poignant and important show that everyone should watch once. It's so real in the portrails of these men and women who lived through this war. I've watched it a couple dozen times and I still get drawn into this story and am touched by the sacrifices so many people made. Please show this to everyone you know. It's important to tell these stories that are becoming lost to time and history.
"Judging by other comments, it seems that this miniseries struck a chord with many viewers. I almost hate to add yet another glowing endorsement since the other reviews are pretty much identical...but here goes. This one made me wonder WHERE DOES AMERICA GET SUCH MEN? The things that Easy Company (boy, there's irony for you!) went through. I've always been grateful to all those who fought for my freedom (I served my country but never had to fight) and have wondered how men could do the awful things that had to be done. I've admired those who actually faced combat. Anyway, Band of Brothers is superbly done historically correct documentary about E Co, 101st Airborne. It follows the lives (and sometimes deaths) of the men of Easy Co. The miniseries takes the men through most of their combat engagements. The cinematography is outstanding. Spielberg and Hanks really did a great job on this miniseries! There are some interviews with some of the survivors, who have remained close to this day. Disks 1-5 are the actual miniseries but WHATEVER YOU DO, DON'T SKIP DISK 6! There is a lot of information about how the film was cast, the ""boot camp"" that the actors went through and how soft actors were turned into lean, hard fighting men. There are more interviews with surviving members of Easy Co. Folks, this is a don't-miss series!"
"This is the true story of Easy Company, 506th Parachute Infantry Regiment, 101st Airborne Division. It start 2 years before D-Day as they train in Camp Toccoa, Georgia. They battle from Normandy ending with the idleness of occupation in Germany.

This is almost perfect television. It takes compelling important history and makes it a thriller touching TV event. There are so many great characters. The greatness of this show is that these actors make these characters come alive. Obviously the audience isn't expected to keep track of every character. However every leading character has a compelling personality. It's also a new level of authenticity for TV production. The action is thrilling. The last episode is slower dealing with an usual aspect of the struggle. The episode is unexpected but compelling nevertheless. This is a great TV war miniseries from start to finish."
"This is peak television. It's authentic and characters feel very real. It feels like you're there, you feel the tension, not made by bad cliches of modern tv shows, but because you're so immersed and on edge all the time. There is no sense of hero vs bad guy, it just feels like everyone is a loser in this. They don't just try to make the other side all look like evil people just to get audience on their side, they just show how it is and what needs to be done. The characters are not perfect, that's what makes this show good. In modern tv shows, they need all the main characters to be perfect and all their actions need to be justified and they need to be likeable, and this and that to a point where they don't feel like real people. Here they do indeed feel like real people so when they die, you really do feel bad and this sense of loss resonates whether it's one of the main character that dies or a German who's also just following orders on the other side and is just as scared. If this show was made today, the show would be more concerned with trying to emotionally attach you to a bunch of main characters who get saved in a cliche way every time and of course they have to be diverse even if it didn't make sense, and add some women as well, story comes second, actually just change the story massively just to fit your own narrative because it's fiction anyway and they treat audience nowadays like braindead zombies who can't think properly so they'll have 1 dimensional characters and a 1 dimensional plot and like they have the attention span to sit through downtime so they got to throw in drama everywhere. I'm glad this came out when it did, HBO would never make something this good nowadays."
"I was watching this series and thought it was good. There was so much talk it was so realistic and based on true stories. Then there was the episode about the Netherlands and seeing the ""hills(!) of Eindhoven"" just made me laugh. The boy who brought olives to the soldiers was just ridiculous, as were the peasants traveling in a Russian carriage. Then my parents and mother-in-law (who lived through all this) pointed out all the other stupid mistakes they made. They found it offensive and couldn't watch for more then 10 minutes. With all the money they put in this series they could have put some towards research in authenticity. Maybe for the USA this war has become just a story but in Europe it is living memory."
Seasons 1-3 and the 2nd half of season 4 are the best this show has to offer. But the rest is easily forgetful I do not remember a single scene that moved me or stuck with me. Ragnar was what made this show great. Vikings is brutal and has some very dark and complex moments. First 3 seasons 10/10 season 4 7/10. Spinoff would have been better for the sons. Ragnar deserved better and Michael Hirst didn't execute.
"I absolutely loved Vikings and already miss it. Obviously, the first 4 seasons were a lot better with Travis Fimmel as Ragnar still on it but the show was still pretty good even after he left...as long as you try not to compare it to those first four seasons. The writing and acting is so good that it just pulls you into their world. Finmel wasn't the only one was great. The entire cast was. Katheryn Winnick (Lagertha), Alexander Ludwig (Bjorn), Clive Standen (Rollo), Gustaf Skarsgard (Floki), Jonathan Rhys Meyers (Bishop Haehmund) and Alex Hogh Anderson (Ivar) all stood out too. Even though the quality went down a little after Fimnel left, I thought the last 10 episodes on Amazon got the show back on track and ended the series on a real high note though."
"Vikings is one of the rare shows where it is never dull and full of entertainment. It's a show with plenty of violence, drama, mystery, etc. The character development is what keeps the show fresh and interesting. It takes you into this world of Vikings and keeps you intrigued throughout the series. I just loved this show so much and even though it hasn't been gone that long I already miss it! I know everyone keeps talking about how the show dropped in quality when Travis Fimmel (Ragnar) left the show, and it did, but it was still a pretty good show after he left as long as you don't compare it to when he was there. Just take it for what it is and that's still a very entertaining show. For some reason it left the History Channel for Amazon Prime Video for the final ten episodes and thought they did a really good job finishing off the story. It's one of the rare great shows where they didn't botch the ending."
"With the release of the last half of the 6th season we finished the epic seven-year saga of Ragnar Lothbrok and his sons. Whilst I am not sure I'd consider ""Vikings"" to be amongst the very top tier of shows I've watched in my lifetime; I've certainly enjoyed my time with the Norsemen.

Ragnar Lothbrok (Travis Fimmel) is a farmer and raider who becomes a legendary figure amongst the Viking people by establishing consistent navigation techniques and leading successful raids on the various Kingdom's that would become Britain. Rising to become King, his legacy is cemented by the actions of his sons, particularly Bjorn Ironside (Alexander Ludwig) and Ivar The Boneless (Alex Hogh Andersen) who would rule countries and influence politics far from their homelands.

The first few episodes don't really convey the scale of the ones that would eventually follow. There are lots of great characters that appear across the run but at the start the show rests on Travis Fimmel's shoulders and he's really good. Ragnar is not a good man, or father and the danger of the character always is present in Fimmel's wild eyes but you still understand why his men fought for him and elevated him so highly that his sons could trade of his name. His sons each derive some aspect of him, Ubbe played by Jordan Patrick Smith is the explorer he wanted to be, Bjorn the noble King, Hvitserk, played by Marco Ilso, is the sufferer and addict and Ivar the vicious warlord. I don't really think any of the characters across the run were poorly performed and it's interesting to look back now and remember some of those characters and the stories that only played for a while.

The scale of the show gets bigger and bigger and the battle scenes more and more expansive. I don't feel as strongly as others that the show drops off as it refocuses on the sons of Ragnar but I would accept that some of the stories don't quite end at their natural point or have deviations that don't go anywhere.

It's not, for me, in that top tier ""West Wing"", ""Game of Thrones"", ""The Wire"" category, but it's not far below and I'm happy to have visited Kattegat for these last few years."
"The first 3 seasons are excellent. I used to recommend this series to all my friends. Few episodes, good story, unique characters. Then the fame came and brought greed. History Channel decided to double the earnings by doubling the number of episodes in season 4. Without enough content to fill the episodes, the show became slow and boring. I decided to stop watching it by the end of season 4 because I realized it was declining. I don't want to screw up my good memories."
"I've been looking forward to a viking film or TV series for many years, and when my wishes were finally granted, I was very worried that this production was going to be total crap. After viewing the first two episodes I do not worry about that anymore. Thank you, Odin:-)

As a person of some historical knowledge of the viking era, I can point out numerous flaws - but they don't ruin the story for me, so I will let them slip. Historical accounts about those days are, after all, not entirely reliable.

Happy to see Travis Fimmel in a role that totally suits him. A physical and intense character, with that spice of humor that is the viking trademark from the sagas. Gabriel Byrne plays a stern leader, that made me think of him in ""Prince of Jutland"", and Clive Standen seems like he's going to surprise us.

Been pondering the Game of Thrones comparison, since I love that show too, but in my opinion Vikings has its own thing going on. Way fewer lead characters to begin with, and also a more straight forward approach. Plenty of room for more series with this high class!

Can I wish for more than the planned nine episodes, PLEASE!!!"
"It is my first review on IMDB, with such disappointment i felt like i had to do it and as a big fan, it is really hard for me to rate this gem so poorly but here is my reasons:

First seasons was so great, i was telling everyone that this show is way better than Game of Thrones and was so hyped about it,and i guess this is the reason for the big failure followed by next seasons. Not sure whether the producers decided to make it as provocative and shocking as GoT or they were out of ideas and decided just to add random boring side stories and dialogues. I wont mention specific scenes to avoid spoilers, but the last season is such a waste of time, there is like 10 percent progress and the rest is boring, emotionless, banal dialogues with characters who you got no emotional bond with and even question their existence in this series (not minding the horrible acting from some of these).

* I would like to mention, that those who just started watching or about to start, please mind that the first 3 seasons are excellent and worth watching.

**Sorry for my poor English as it is not my main language."
"I've been waiting for someone to make a good series about the vikings. I'm from Norway myself, and I'm naturally interested in our history. I've only seen two episodes so far, but I have to say - it really looks promising. The surroundings and nature in the two first episodes is exactly how it looks in ""Vestlandet"", the western parts of Norway. Stunnings fjords with waterfalls cascading down the sides. It really looks authentic.

The acting is mostly top notch, a few short scenes aren't that great but it's hardly mentionable. It seems like in the beginning, people are speaking an incomprehensible Norse/English mix, and then they continue speaking a modern English. It's pretty clever actually. Fun fact: When the Vikings invaded the British isles they could understand each other's languages.

The story itself is really exciting, and I just want to watch more.. I can hardly wait for the next episode to be released.

I don't know so much about the Ragnar Lodbrok character, but Rollo (Gangarolf) is a very famous character in the Norse sagas.

I highly recommend this show, and I really hope they continue making this for several seasons."
"19 January 2018

I'm not a fan of historical and quasi-historical films and series, so I had no high expectations for ""Vikings"". But the first season bought me right away. It's completely different from anything I've seen so far, and there are more dead than in ""Game of Thrones"". Now I finished the second season and the series just keeps getting better. It seems to me that there are more scheming and twists than in GoT. The acting and characterization are excellent, and the action scenes are incredibly believable and realistic. It gets more and more complicated and tense and will not only hold your attention but also your breath.

7 April 2024

I finally made it to the end. In the later seasons, the story branches out in too many directions and gets overly complicated. The series in most respects maintains the level until the very end, but the story begins to repeat itself, the same plots revolve around different generations of characters and, although it cannot be said that the quality decreases, it all becomes a bit monotonous. Some of the denouements delighted me, some disappointed me, and some felt unfinished, but I guess that's a matter of taste. All in all, an above-average series, but I think they should have ended it earlier. Definitely a recommendation, if for no other reason than because of the original and striking performances of the entire cast, among which Katheryn Winnick, Gustaf Skarsgård, Alex Hogh Andersen, and Travis Fimmel stand out the most.

8/10."
"I really enjoyed this first episode. Writing is strong. Acting is good and more importantly I am really fascinated by the characters. The most impressive thing however was the look of the show. Photography, art direction and just whole look is so lush and rich looks like a feature film. Cant wait for episode 2! Both Travis and Gabriel Byne both shine in their roles. I do hope a season 2 is in the works. I have read a lot about vikings and I can see the makes really went to great lengths to bring the true viking ways to the screen. Especially the religion and gods. I am a fan GOT and this show is great that it delves into the ancient world, but this show has a different flavor. More raw and intense, but still with a nice magical feel to it."
"I've watched the two first episodes of the series and I can say that I'm POSITIVELY surprised.

I didn't know if this would be any good but I'm most certainly intrigued. It's well written, exciting and charming. The show is very enjoyable, especially if you're interested in Scandinavian/European history.

I love Norse Mythology and I am very happy that this show aired, I just hope it continues going in a good direction. :)

All in all I can't wait for the remaining episodes and if you're considering picking this show up I'd definitely recommend it."
"There have been one or two negative reviews posted about this show and I have to say that after 2 episodes, I really like it... nit pickers may say that there are historical inaccuracies, but there are also many myths dispelled ... and with the appearance of Valkyrie on the battlefield at the very beginning of ep1 to take fallen warriors souls, unless you are deluded and believe in that being factual it was clear from the very outset that there was always going to be some dramatic license used. Others say the show is too Hollywood, this has to be the case to some extent but by no means is this another mass produced piece of garbage, unless you want the show cancelled after the pilot it must appeal to a mass American audience as entertainment it isn't a documentary. I personally feel that the show DOES have a European feel which is absent in many historical dramas, the locations are beautiful, the cast has been well selected and act their parts fantastically well. The good guys are instantly likable where as the bad guys you just can't wait to see them get whats coming to them, that is always a good sign as far as I am concerned as i want to see what happens to them and am looking forward to the next episode. So don't be put off by the pedantic armchair historians out there give vikings a chance.. it is what it is."
"As usual on IMDb fictional dramas set in a particular period in history attract the bores that insist on bleating 'its not historically accurate'. Well just ignore them as this is a fantastic and exciting look at the relatively unexplored Viking world. In the same vein as other fictional historical dramas such as Spartacus or Rome the plot centres around a single character and their family. We then take a brief look into their world and are shown how dangerous a place the world was at this time. The show has a quality feel to it not like some of the more poorly made historical drama around today (sorry but Camelot was just awful!). The sets are impressive and believable and the direction and framing of each scene is obviously set by a skilled hand. The characters are all interesting and likable and the acting is top notch. The only negative I could draw on was that there could have been a bit more action in the first episode but what action there was was very well done. My advice to you, just watch and enjoy it for what it is and don't be out off by the history buffs. If we insisted on only ever watching historical drama that was 100% accurate I'm pretty sure we would be watching none at all. Great show, a solid nine out of ten."
"After last season (S6) , clearly you can see a few youngs actress are trying to be good enough like Travis Fimmel or i see they are pretending. this make vikings to a low quality series , it was fantastic but now ...The storyline and role-playing are really weak. -3 for the last two seasons."
"Maybe it isn't real 100 percent history. Some liberties were taken, but for the most part is seems to ring true.At times it almost seems like a contemporary crime drama, but the facts are there-the raids on British monastaries that did occur in the late 8th century, a fairly realistic depiction on what Norse life was probably like at this timeline, the spectacular countryside with its majestic forests and rivers, and the depictions of the Vikings themselves. Savage, eager to loot and plunder, but nevertheless bound by a sort of code of honor. Their acts are savage and the chieftan seems more like a medieval Godfather who uses his power for his own personal gain and who is not above killing somebody on the spot if he is displeased with his actions. The storyline is fairly literate and not the usual mindless adventure that too many of these movies present to us, and the characters are convincingly drawn and likely motivated. The music is good and the full size replicas of the ships are very accurate. Even the deliberate pace works to its advantage, we are never rushed and the story develops as it moves along. It is never dull and there is plenty of interest to engage the viewer. However, if you are put off by graphic violence , don't watch it. Those times were fairly brutal. Fine entertainment . Enjoy it."
S1-3= 10 stars....and then the show died. S4 and 5 is a complete mess with no substance...sooo disapointed.
"There are some Hollywood liberties taken during the show this is to be expected it is a show. If you made a show about everyday life during the vikings time most would be dull and not exciting it is not like they went to battle everyday. The show has a lot of historical basis with some liberties taken to liven the show up. It is well produced and has great cinematography . If , you are however looking for a straight fact based view on vikings go to the library and pull anthropology research journals out. For everyone else if you like battles with historical styles, understandings of how they navigated and views on the social structure of the vikings then you will get a understanding. You will also see how laws and ethics were for the vikings so yes there is some historical accuracy to the show . All in all if you want entertainment mixed with history it is a great show."
Having being all superheroed out with the never ending train of films this is so much welcome relief. It's not for kids and I love the choice language which is appropriate.
"Started watching this brilliant spin on a superhero show after dinner. Now it's 4 am and I have just watched the whole thing.

From the very first episode I was glued to this exciting, interesting and crazy ride."
"I've had big expectations about this show, because I thought that is going to be exactly that kind of show, in which the good guys (the superheroes) fight the bad guys (the villains) and of course, they win. I couldn't have been more wrong, especially because ""The Boys"" it's not about a desperate attempt of superheroes to save the world from evil, instead this show takes a much more realistic approach, about what is going to happen if superheroes had really existed.

I'm saying that I had big expectations in the beginning, because I thought that it would be the same usual show with superheroes and villain, that is most likely to find everywhere. In the first couple of episodes I've been a little bit disappointed, or rather shocked, because like I've already said, ""The Boys"" describes what the MCU never did. Of course, the movies and shows from Marvel are destined to other public's category, but this show is tough. It has all you could not expect from a TV series with superheroes. It has violence, gore, nudity, astonishing CGI effects and a very unpredictable and solid storyline. In the end it seems that this one delivered what I didn't expect it to and I am pleased with that. The show is definitely worth watching."
"Excellent dystopian reimagining for Superhero nerds. Surprising, violent, always twisting. Binge-watched in 2 days! So glad for a second season, though will be so impatient! Thumbs up."
"First it's just a very interesting take on the whole superhero genre. But there's also a lot more. Great actors, great storyline and very nice picture. I guess for me it's the best superhero series yet, followed by Titans and Umbrella Academy."
"Give a celebrity super powers and you have The Boys. Narcisistic and arrogant. Above the law. Of course I enjoy Marvel and DC, but honestly, they are unrealistic. If Supes were real, this is how they would act. Sure, you would have a handful of good ones, but the majority would do what they wanted. The Boys shows the real and darker side of humanity. Our current celebrities consider themselves better than everyone else, and if you gave them super powers, then just imagine how they would behave. On the outside they would appear good, but behind closed doors their true colors would show. Well, ""The Boys"" know this and they are bent on taking down the Supes and showing their true colors. Like I said, if Supes were real, this is how I imagine it would be. Did I mention Karl Urban? Stellar performance. And Anthony Starr as Homelander is fabulous(Superman meets Captain America meets Arrogant Superstar). If you want a realistic look into Superheroes, then watch The Boys."
Just finished watching the four first episodes. The pilot has to be one of greatest pilots I've ever seen. It has everything and I was hooked immideately. And it keeps getting better. I didn't know I needed this. It's really bold and a fresh wind for TV.
"There's nothing more that I can really say about The Boys that hasn't already been said. It's just a flat out awesome show! It's easily become one of my favorite new shows in years! I binged the entire first two seasons in just a few days when they first came out and rewatched them again for the second time before Season 3 came out. I was expecting a little bit of a drop off for Season 3 because Season 1 and 2 were so great, and there is a little drop in quality but it's still a very good show! It takes everything you loved about Season 1 and 2 (the violence, humor, heart, craziness, character development, etc.) and takes it all to a whole new level! This show has such an original take on the Superhero genre that is both exciting and hilarious! I can not recommend this show enough! Just a warning though...once you start watching it it's hard to stop. Give yourself enough time because you'll want to binge it as quickly as possible!"
With all these awful shows like supergirl and legends of tomorrow etc..The Boys is the perfect antidote to that insipid moralistic tripe that's spewed our TVs so thank you Amazon Prime for treating us like adults and I can't wait for the second season
"The Boys is one of the best Superhero shows I've ever seen. While Season 1 was the best season of the series, Season 2 and 3 were also both very good and absolutely worth watching. Season 3 was fantastic, Jensen Ackles was the perfect actor to add to this already incredible show! This show continues to amaze as it's not afraid to try new things and is a show that is definitely for adults. It has no problems being offensive and making you feel squeamish. You don't even have to be a fan of superhero shows to enjoy this. It's violent, funny, thrilling, etc.. Everything you want in a good superhero show. Season 4 just added Jeffrey Dean Morgan to the cast. Another great addition to an already incredible cast. I don't know what else I can say except I absolutely love this series and can't wait for more to come!"
"Predictable. One shocking scene after another. This is the layziest writing and directing ever. Talking heads, bs dialogs and constantly people sitting and talking. And talking. No dynamic. This season is so off, it looks like they cut the budget in half. If it wasn't for some effects this would be really impossible to watch. The quality dropped so much that it is not worth wasting time and energy.

The family story lines are boring and feel like time fillers. The characters are off and lame. Even the new ones. The pretend like we know them, but we don't. And why would you care? There is so much implausible stuff in this season.. I don't even know where to start."
"The boys started really well, but from the last episode of season 3, the show has been going downhill. The story has stopped progressing, and the creators are only adding stuff to generate shocking reactions from viewers. Unfortunately, this isn't working anymore. Weird scenes looked good when the story was moving forward, but now that it isn't, I am just unable to watch it anymore. The performances of all the actors are good, but the writing has been really bad. The characters are making weird choices that don't match their personalities, and the attempt to stretch things out is very visible on screen. All in all, The Boys has fallen off."
"This Amazon series is set in a world where there are superheroes; they aren't typical superheroes though; they work for the powerful Vought Corporation and consider ratings and profit to be more important than saving lives. They are also arrogant, disillusioned or generally unpleasant. The worst of these are 'The Seven', the most senior heroes who are heavily marketed by Vought. Working to expose them is a group known as 'The Boys'; led by Billy Butcher who is convinced that leader of the heroes, Homelander, is responsible for the disappearance of his wife. We are introduced to each group via new members; Hughie Campbell joins The Boys after ultrafast hero A-Train ran through his girlfriend; and Annie January an idealistic young heroine known as Starlight who joins The Seven. Hughie and Annie become friends before learning what the other is doing.

When I first heard of this I thought it was just a case of Amazon jumping on the superhero bandwagon but then heard a radio review which made it sound like a series I might like... it most certainly is! If you like your heroes to be heroic and good rather than self-centred egomaniacs you might not like this but if you like to see conventions turned on their head this is great. Another major difference between this and more typical stories featuring superheroes is that this is definitely not family friendly; there is a lot of strong violence, some sex and nudity and possibly the most swearing I've heard in a TV show. The story develops well over the two seasons that are currently available with some good twists and plenty of interesting character development. The characters on both sides are interesting and the cast does a great job portraying them. While the story can be a bit dark at times it is lightened by its humour; often being genuinely hilarious as we see events that wouldn't seem the most obvious source of laughs. Overall I'd definitely recommend this to older superhero fans who are looking for something different. I can't wait for season three."
Want to see what it would really be like with super heroes around? Check this out! No kids play here folks....not for kids. Best damn series on right now....about time!
"Can't say I recall seeing Anthony Star in any films (and I'm an Aussie) but his performance as Homelander is really something else - someone give him an award. Can't wait for next season, and more projects with Star."
Great twist on the superhero genre. The story is well written. The acting is good. Definitely an entertaining series.
"When I first heard of 'The Boys', I thought it would be your standard superhero series, but when I actually watched it, I discovered I was dead wrong. After 15 minutes of the first episode, it was impossible to stop watching. It was a more believable take on what the world would look like if superheroes were flying around today, with characters that were unforgettably unique. There were times when I thought that the 'good guys' were the 'bad guys', and times when I thought the 'bad guys' were the 'good guys'. But in the end, I found that there weren't any 'all-good' or 'all-bad' characters, but 'all-human' characters, sometimes with more-than-human abilities. It's a super series, definitely worth your time."
"Season 4 of The Boys is close to unwatchable.

Violence and gore are ok as long as they're justified and part of the plot, in season 4, it feels like it's there just to A, fill up the time and B, because the writers are simply deranged

But the biggest problem, as many other viewers point out, is that it is way too political

Hollywood and Hollywood-adjacent screenwriters and showrunners need to understand that the audience does not want political views shoved down their throat

I guess it's going to take a few more years, box office bombs and scathing reviews for them to understand it, but they'll get there in the end

hopefully."
"It's a sad year for The Boys.. What started as a captivating and entertaining show, has devolved into a painful hour of viewing each week. I could easily binge the first 2 seasons seasons (and even season 3 for the most part)... but the subtle & clever political undertones of earlier seasons, which were an afterthought to the storyline & character building, has become the sole purpose of the show now it seems. I barely get through each new episode, but continue to hold on in the hopes of some kind of glimpse of The Boys seasons I fell in love with in the first place. There are still a few good scenes and humor sprinkled in, but it's mostly just the writer shoving their extreme political view down your throat every chance they get. It's becoming predictable and very repetitive at this point. I hope things will start to get better, and I'll most likely tough it out for the remainder of the season as something to put on in the background while I'm doing other stuff, but if it continues this trajectory, I won't be around for season 5 (if it even gets there)."
"I hate superhero movies and maybe only saw Christopher Nolan's masterpiece, Batman.

But this TV series drove me crazy, all the moments of the story are fascinating and the choice of actors, especially Homelander and Butcher, is unique.

Congratulations on this wonderful series, everything is going great."
"I just popped in to tell you all:

The ending makes the journey worth while..... I promise :)"
"I love this show. It's a feel good comedy that's lighthearted and will make you laugh while still trying to get some good life lessons across. You also don't need to search to find the deeper meaning in the show, its made blatantly obvious, but its not heavy.

Kristen Bell is quirky and lovable in this, and the rest of the cast is an odd blend of characters that just mix so well together. The acting and writing is phenomenal and the production is bright and cheerful and pleasant to watch.

NBC is winning this season with new shows.

I definitely recommend it."
"I thought this would be boring, but watched the pilot... then the second episode... then the third... fourth... fifth... sixth... seventh... and came full-stop only because those are the only episodes I could watch now On Demand.

Smart, funny, and thoughtful, with diverse characters and a quirky premise. Fun to see Ted Danson in a comedy again, too.

Not the usual, run-of-the-mill comedy, but also not just an off-the-rail-whatever show. Always seems to be an ethical point made.

I especially like the ""Welcome"" movie. Wondering about MY score.

Hey, Janet?"
"Perfect. Just perfect. I appreciate that the series ended at the right time, and I can feel that it served its exact purpose. The whole cast/crew deserves a standing ovation. Every detail of this series is so meaningful, funny, sad, smart, emotional, all at the same time.

It was a unique and enlightening experience to watch this series. I can recommend it to anyone, with any kind of taste."
"Two moths ago I lost my wife.So many Grief I had ,So many tears. This show told me maybe she is in the good place now. After many years I will find her in the good place. Thank you. All the cast of the show. Thank you! The creator of the show."
"I know true perfection doesn't really exist and that every show has it's flaws, but with The Good Place I just can't think of what they would be.

The Good Place is a fantastic show that I will forever remember fondly and to anyone reading this I hope you give the show a chance and watch it through.

Take it sleazy."
"The good place is when a tv show is changing the world for the better. There are no longer a lot of this type of program on television, and this is a rational thing in the public domain, but an act that has become a bad place, or this is what I thought before I watched so good place. When I watch The Good Place, I do not watch it as an entertainment series. I am changing my life for the better, and the series has already succeeded in doing that. Thank you, The Good Place. Note The series contains the most relaxing nerve ending you will watch so don't forbid yourself to watch it"
"Just watched the double-episode pilot of ""The Good Place"" and I would say it's a ""Good Comedy"".

First of all the premise is original. Another newcomer of the season ""Kevin Can Wait"" is the epitome of family sitcoms. This is almost in every way new. Only downside: it would be more fitting for a movie than a (long-running?) series. At some point might seem repetitive or loose its initial spark.

Second, it seems like it has high production values, I mean a wide set and good visuals. All bright and cheerful.

The script holds a few surprises to keep you interested and the blunt editing from afterlife to life and back adds to the entertainment.

I like Kristen Bell as the main character. The part suits her. The otherwise great Ted Danson is OK in this one, but I think the writers have to improve his lines.

Overall: Because of its very distinct premise, some might love it, some might hate it. Personally I find it entertaining enough to continue watching."
"This is a wonderful shot (only 20 mins) of comedy that is clever enough to keep your brain functioning without being over taxing. I just wonder why - in the afterlife - there are no old people??

Sadly while I enjoyed the first 2 seasons, I can't get through season 3. It has become a dirge."
"50 episodes was a bit too much for its premise. The first season is good, second season less good, third season is the worst, season 4 is just average.

If it had been 3 seasons of 10 episodes, it would have been one of the freshest TV shows ever. Too many stretched and unnecessary episodes. The writers were out of idea, to be honest!

I fail to understand how it even got an average of 8.2... This has been one of the most tiresome binge-watching experience for me.

Seasons 1 and 2 are still recommended though..."
"I watched season 1 because a work mate suggested it as good comedy. To me, that definition should provide at least an engaging kind of humour, or a good, strong plot.

Being used to traditionally witty comedy (take Frasier as a baseline) I was expecting a much more interesting sense of humour, but I get stuck in some predictable, naive and superficial jokes (really, should we be praising the writers for something like ""what the fork?"").

Regarding the plot, what was a potentially good idea tries here to stay alive for the thirteen episodes without really going nowhere. Each character is stuck in a superficial portrait that makes it just a caricature, with exaggerated features and no real inner development. The twist at the end of Season 1 is on the same line: a trick that keeps some trite television alive for some more time. An (exaggeratedly) indecisive person is a bad person that deserves hell (or: ""a Bad Place"")? A serial fund-raiser should be sent to ""a Bad Place"" only for not being fully involved with each one of the persons she's helping? An (exaggeratedly) bad person in real life should try to become good after death just because is confronting the menace of eternal suffering? These kind of questions are so unnecessary that all of them are not worth any time from anyone.

Giving a 3 because I feel bad giving a 1. But I doubt it to be an ethical development after watching this!"
And now it's over but I won't forget it. There is nothing more I can say beyond what has been said. This show was unique and wonderful. I loved it. I loved it so very much. I will miss it. Thank you Michael Schur and everyone involved - you did a good thing.
"There are very few tv shows/movies that I give 10 stars - and The Good Place is one of them.

The first season was great, I always thought the after life to be a great subject with endless possibilities, and they gave it a nice and smart idea, with good humour.

The 2nd and 3rd seasons werent amazing, but it was still worth watching. I really thought that the director had lost the way, because after the first plot twist what else could they show us, right? I had the impression the storyline was getting too ""crazy"". Well, I was wrong, it was all to lead where the writter wanted.

I read somewhere they had it planned from the beginning that the show would be 4 seasons and I finished watching - the last one was absolutely marvelous. The way they worked with all the ""afterlife problems"" that many people can think of but never give too much thoght to it - it was all explored in the series, and the ending was one of the best finales in TV history, superb. They gave every character a proper closure, leaving no loose ends.

The show is way way more than I expected at first sight, has deep philosophical reflections, awesome characters - their development as a (dead) person, and the way they finished it made it go to my masterpiece's list. A show that I'd recommend to anyone, any age."
"Honestly, this show is fun. That's the bottom line for it. I have watched the first eight episodes so far, and it's not the funniest or most clever TV I have every watched, but it was fun to view. It's bright, has fun set pieces, and the characters are all great. Kristen Bell and Ted Danson both play their parts beautifully, and are a pleasure to watch perform. One of the most fun aspects of the show is slowly having the rules of ""The Good Place"" revealed to you as you watch. I hope this show isn't cancelled, because I would be sorely disappointed if I didn't get to keep learning how this world operates. If you haven't yet tried out ""The Good Place"" it is well worth a shot."
"The Good Place isn't the best comedy show, but it might be the most creative and thought-provoking. It's very special."
"One of the most inquisitive and exquisite shows ever made. So deep on so many levels but yet fascinatingly simple. Goodness, beauty, happiness, truth. Simply transcending."
"The final season proved that this show really is a beautiful one (and one of the best shows ever on TV).

Final episode is just crazy. Couldn't think of any other better way to end the show. <3 <3 <3

Take it sleazy xx"
"This show made me laugh and think and introspect about moral philosophy more than anything. Even the silliest of scenes and dialogues raised some very philosophical questions. It wasn't 'laughing your stomach out' funny but yeah it was interesting and overall a fun watch. One could easily write a essay on the moral philosophy in the first two seasons. It made sense and it was fun to watch.

But from from season 3 onwards it became extremely dull and unintelligent , and it just completely stopped being funny. Season 3 was this endless chaos where I am not sure what the writers are trying to portray/ ask/ or even try to convey anymore.

The thing that made the show special for me was its ability to convey something meaningful but with a bit of humor. But it seems that the writers are just dragging along the story line now just for the sake of extending this show to a certain number of seasons."
"Loved Season 1 and 2.

Season 3 changed all the characters and dumped them in a boring place. It is like watching a low budget sit-com. It has none of the interest and charm of the previous seasons.

I assume they changed writers or existing writers didn't get the deal they wanted and they just churned out some scripts to meet legal obligations."
"First off, I have loved Kristen Bell's work ever since the late, lamented Veronica Mars series. Like Buffy, she is the perky blonde who saves the world. And perhaps in this series, she will have to do the same - literally! The whole ""look and feel"" reminds me very much of Pushing Daisies - the saturated colours, the segues into absurdity, even the life-after-death motifs. And that's not a bad thing - Daisies was one of my top favourite shows.

Ted Danson gets to put aside some of the gravitas that he had to bring to CSI, and return to his successful comedic abilities a la Cheers.

I'm looking forward to seeing more."
"The Good Place is an excellent TV show. It is a plot-driven comedy that should be renowned not only for its comedic value but for how it explores themes of philosophy and existentialism. This show has inspired me to introspect and has motivated me to make changes in how I conduct my life and treat others around me.

It prompts fascinating discussions of ethics, humanity and the afterlife, all while we are compelled to laugh, cry and grow with the main characters as we become invested in their development. There are shocking, unforeseen twists that will keep you guessing at every turn of events, and I don't think I have resonated so much with a work of fiction before.

If you're looking for a new TV show to watch, or are currently unsure as to whether this is for you, please deliberate no longer - this is the answer."
"24 was such an original and exciting show! It was a groundbreaking show that had it all...action, drama, suspense, mystery, twists, excitement, etc. The entire season takes place over the course of 24hrs with each episode making up one hour. It's about a Counter Terrorism Unit led by an agent named Jack Bauer (Kiefer Sutherland) as they race to save the country from terrorists. Not every season was great but most were and they're all worth watching! It was an action packed thriller that kept you on the edge of your seat throughout the series! Kiefer Sutherland was absolutely perfect as Jack Bauer! If you enjoy action packed shows where you can't wait to see what happened next then this is the show for you!"
24 was one of my favorite shows growing up. It was absolutely ahead of its time when it came out and is still great today. No show at the time had you at the edge of your seat every episode quite like 24. The 24 hour clock was so original at the time. This was a a show where every season not only had the great Jack Bauer as the hero but every season had a great villain too. There were also so many twists and turns that it would have you guessing what what happen next. This is a show that will hook you right from the beginning and keep you entertained every episode of every season. This truly is a one of a kind show with non stop action.
The first 4 seasons were so incredible. It was a tough premise to keep up though. Cracks started appearing in season 5 and season 6 just became down right ridiculous. But Jack Bauer is one of the best TV characters ever created and Kiefer Sutherland was born to play this part. This show was the definition of serial thrill ride. My friends and I used to have weekly viewing parties and if you broke the gag order on spoilers you were dead to us. Some of the funniest times I've ever had watching a show. It was more like an experience.
"I haven't watched every single TV show out there but I've watched more than a fair share (GoT, The Sopranos, The Wire, Six Feet Under, Deadwood, Breaking Bad, House, The Shield, Dexter, Lost, Justified, Prison Break, Mad Men, Walking Dead, House of Cards and a few others) and this reamins my favorite of them all. Great premise, top acting, superb action scenes, etc. The only flaw is they started recycling plots and storylines at one point but that was after years of incredible quality. Must-watch."
"This show is one of a kind, the directors were so smart and they created something never seen in tv history. The acting is sooo good the characters are awesome the story the villans are all phenomenal Respect to the creators."
"24 is a great TV series. It's design and story lines are really a thrill to experience. The day out of the life of agent Jack Bauer is one of a kind. The series plays in real time (including the commercial breaks).

I can certainly recommend to watch this series. It's even more fantastic, if you not watch it as it's aired, but record some episodes and then watch them in in a pattern of 2 per evening for some days after another. In this way you find yourself addicted to the adrenaline which 24 unleashes.

This is TV as it was designed. I must admit that I look forward to the movie which is planned. I hope not that it's a normal movie, but that they put elements of the real time (or something similar) into it. At least the thrill should be similar.

I just finished Day 6 (season 6) and now have to rehab from my 24 addiction again."
"What i found amazing is how can anyone criticize 24 ... The actors are not boring, they all have their own role on the show. Each season speaks about a terrorist problem, and what's the problem? do they look so much alike? no! If you start to watch a episode with all the suspense and REALLY GREAT action, you'll keep sit on the couch till it's end! Watching 24 won't make you smarter or add anything new to your brains, but will definitely entertain you more than any other TV show for 43minutes and you'll pray till next Monday arrives! If you expect a drama, or worst, a similar show to any of those recent movies such as ""body of lies"", you can turn your head to the other side, 24 only offers what best the TV got, the pleasure of be inside the screen..

It's a perfect 10 in 10 for 24 and Jack Bauer!"
"I have to first be honest & say I'm not a huge TV show person. I've watched plenty, but nowadays I tend to prefer series on streaming services such a Netflix, prime etc, or movies. However, around 6 years ago my husband & I discovered 24 & started binging from the beginning, and this was after the show had been wrapped up for about 10 years.. and even then it still held up & never felt dated.. we were so into it, to the point we would stay up well past midnight to catch just 1 more episode, and another & another- and we both would comment that had we started to watch it back when it aired on Television, there's no way we would've been able to handle the suspense of waiting week to week for the next episode to air! Talk about cliffhangers! The main points I will touch on that many of the other reviewers mentioned is Kiefer Sutherland was truly born to play the role of Jack Bauer, and his character is like no other. There have been many jokes said about ""Jack Bauer for president"", and all sort of other memes about Jack being the hero that he is. Never mind the plots of each season, the execution of the storylines, the action scenes, I can go on & on. It's just so good. I will agree with another reviewer who said the first 4 seasons are probably the best, but I wouldn't just stop there. Infact, just recently I actually decided to binge the entire franchise all over again! Enough time had passed that it was sort of like watching it again for the first time. Even though I knew what most of the outcomes would be I still enjoyed it just as much as when I watched the first go round. We own the entire box set so I'm sure I will rewatch again down the line! And I PRAY they find a way to bring Jack Back.. I've heard chatters, I think it's something everyone including Kiefer & the writers want, I suppose it just has to be the right fit, to make it relevant to current times, and create a new plot that they haven't done before, as another reviewer mentioned the recycling of plots in the later seasons. Though I'd love nothing more than to see some older characters return, I think that's impossible (for obvious reasons I don't want to spoil) but a new set of fresh faces & new environment would be plenty for me!!

Also, if you have not seen the 2014 reboot 24:Live another day, check it out! It's worth the watch!"
Years from now we'll look back on this as a classic!
"This show definitely has re-written the book on intelligent and credible suspense on TV. Extremely well acted, written and directed. Truly gripping, heart-stopping suspense from one hour to the next. The show is so well done that you can easily forgive the very few plot devices that seem a little weak. When a show gets 99% of everything right, it's very hard to quibble. Keifer Sutherland has never been better as the flawed hero. ""24"" deserves to be a model on which all future TV suspense thrillers can be compared to. A+++"
"24, What can i say? A breakthrough in TV history, one of the greatest show's to reach our screen in a long time. With amazing plot lines that changed constantly, you can never trust a character no matter what, and you can never grow to love a character as tradition within 24 has it, everyone dies in the end.

Season One was fantastic followed by another amazing season, then the show shook with a rockety season 3. However producers reinvented 24 with its forth season followed by another brilliant season, but the curse of the third season struck once more, season 6. It started well, but towards the end it made you feel, they've done this before, and you would find yourself thinking, what actually happened ? Producers promise Season 7 and 8 to be a new re-invention, with a totally new cast, lets hope it survives..."
"Season 5 remains one of the best individual seasons in the history of tv. Sort of like breaking bad season 4 or so.

It is simply epic- with a lot of high stakes plot twists and thrills. Kiefer sutherland plays the best action hero in the history of TV - even to date he hasnt been surpassed- reviewing this in 2022.

If you liked the movie 'die hard' then this easily tops it, as it has political intrigue, conspiracies and a bit of romance to boot.

Season 5 rating - a perfect score 10/10.

I have watched all the other seasons, but nothing comes close to season 5."
"Whether you like this show or not, it changed tv forever. Never was there such a big budget, movie star cast and amazing production before 24. This started the trend of that. The money men saw that this was big business and started to flood shows with cash. Also got more movie actors that would never have thought of going into tv, which before was a poisoned chalice, classed as a major step down. TV shows were a stepping stone to movies and I guess they still are, but you can now move between both without being labelled. The only time you could do that before is if you guest starred on something like Colombo or something. But even then, it was usually a movie star that had a stalled career for some reason. Anyway, I loved 24 and still do. Still stands up today and very fun to watch. Ok it gets kinda formulaic after a few seasons, but it's like watching Star Trek, you know it's all gonna be fine by the end but you still watch it. Jack Bauer is a great character and Kiefer plays him so well. If you haven't watched it, you're simply missing out."
"This is the most creative, intelligent, well-written, unpredictable, and suspenseful program that I have ever seen, and this is coming from a man who watches a lot of television.

Throughout its four seasons, 24 provides a cliff hanger at the end of most episodes to keep you attached and has provided some of the most unpredictable twists that I have ever seen, including the ultimate shocker at the end of the first season (which I won't go into because somebody may read this before watching the first season).

As far as acting goes, there isn't a weak-link on the show. Kiefer Sutherland leads a cast of exceptionally impressive and compelling actors/actresses that make the show great week after week.

I would strongly recommend that if you do not already watch 24, start now because you're really missing out."
"I don't know where to start with this show, it's just incredible! I've seen it twice and I was on the edge of my seat just as much second time round even though I knew what was coming! The 24 hour concept is done really well, the acting and scripts/stories are done so so well. My favourite season has to be season 5 with my least favourite being 6. All characters from Jack Bauer to George Mason are really well explained and any main character deaths are really emotional and hard hitting. I highly recommend watching this show."
"Much like the rest of the viewers who watched the amazing first season, the only reason I was drawn in was because of the whole real-time aspect of the show. I was thinking before I began watching it that even if the show did suck itself, at least there'd be some sort of twist. But it was far from being terrible. By the end of the first season in the spring of last year, I was hooked. The finale blew me away and I realized just how great of a show it was. Keifer Sutherland is Jack Bauer, without a doubt. He brought that character off of the pages and made it one we could sympathize with, yet chastise when he did something wrong. And the brilliance behind the show is the fact that it can take any unpredictable turn it wants to, and they can make it work. Even with this third season only a month into it, it's hard to figure out where things are going. They get you going on one problem the presidency and CTU has to face, then they throw a completly shocking new one at you.

However, the show seems to be heading down the predictable path now. I'm not going to be solidifying my feelings on this yet, because it can go anywhere, but with the popularity of it growing, and the producers recieving more money, they seem to be dropping creativity for more action and explosions, which is a sin in my eyes. The first season to me seemed like an excellent movie that was original and well done, but this third season seems to be aiming more at promoting Ford (honestly, there's a Ford in every shot. I know they're providing a lot of money, but it bugs me how the producers try to get one in every shot) and getting more money than making it as gritty and original as the first season.

First Season: A+ (10/10) Second Season: B (8/10) Third Season (So Far): C+ (7/10) They're keeping me interested, but not glued to my television set every Tuesday night.

I only watch two shows every week religiously, and ""24"" is one of them. If they can't keep it up, I just may only watch one a week."
"I'm giving 8 stars to the S1-S8. They are so funny to watch even repeatedly. To be honest, without Charlie,I never finish watching even one episode of S9 and I would not watch it any more. This show now is dead to me. I'd rather watch the former 8 seasons again and again. I like Charlie, Rose, little Jake, Berta and Evelyn in the show. At first I think this show is just for fun. But as I watch more, I realize that there are a lot of other things that I like which can make people stop to think. Charlie seems to be womanizing and nonchalant to his mother and brother at first. Yet I see a loving Charlie when Evelyn is vulnerable, when he comes into Jake's room to find the sulking Jake who is hiding in his room just because Charlie threatens Alan to move out. Rose loves Charlie so much and she is a good girl. So funny to see her head popping out from the deck. .... This show, S1-S8, is one of the best sitcoms in my eyes."
"It was only two and a half men until season eight, after that it was just a simple show, a pity ... The role of Ashton Kutcher was good, but this sudden turn of the story and the events that caused it, I could not follow with the same mentality as before, this show belonged to Charlie Sheen, is and will be."
"Two and a half men doesn't deserve to go on,now that they've fired Charlie sheen and hired Asthon Kutcher as his replacement.This show is nothing without Charlie Sheen he was the main reason to watch this show.I have to admit this show started losing its's potential once Jake started getting older. It seems like every episode had the same plot Charlie sleeping with random women he doesn't care about and Alan whining about his social life,don't get me wrong this show was funny during the time Charlie Sheen was on the show.Ever since Ashton Kutcher came on this show its gotten very vulgar it seems like the writers have an obsession with farting,masturbation,sex,and bathroom jokes.Bottom line this show needs to be canceled."
"Two and a Half Men is one of guilty pleasures. While not the best sitcom ever, it's still good. The show dropped down in quality a little bit when Charlie Sheen left and Ashton Kutcher took over. Charlie Sheen and John Cryer just had such great chemistry that it was going to drop a little in quality regardless who took over. The Sheen years were better than Kutchers but it's still decent with Kutcher. I would've like to see more with Sheen but unfortunately he lost his mind and had to be fired. The supporting actors are all pretty funny in this too. There are too many to name but they all do a good job. There's a reason that reruns are always on and that's because it's such a popular show."
I have to say Two and Half Men has really grown on me over the years. It's always on so it's hard to miss but I've come to like it a lot. Like most people have already pointed out it was obviously a lot better with Charlie Sheen but I don't think it was as terrible with Ashton Kutcher as some people say. It was still watchable as long as you try to look at it as its own show and not compare the two. It's just too bad that Sheen went nuts because they could've probably got a few more good seasons with him and Cryer. This is one of those shows you can have on in the background as you're doing other stuff around the house because you've seen all the episodes several times.
"I just heard about Conchata Ferrell (Berta).

She was very funny and had the best lines.

Nothing else to say.

I will miss her dearly

💜💜💜😘😘😘😘"
"Two and a Half Men was my all-time favorite TV show. I watched every episode when it aired from the series premiere up until Charlie's exit. Now, I see it time to time, and I couldn't be more disappointed with Chuck Lorre and his crew. Nothing against Ashton Kutcher, he's trying his best to be funny, but he and Jon Cryer don't have the amazing chemistry that Sheen and Cryer did. To pile on, Jake (Angus T. Jones) has now left the show, replaced by Charlie's 25-year old lesbian daughter, Jenny (Amber Tamblyn).

I'll admit that I do still watch the show occasionally, not because I enjoy it, but more out of curiosity to see how bad it can really get. In my opinion, if the writers had done it right (assuming that firing Sheen was right, which it absolutely was not), after Charlie's death, they should have bumped Cryer up to lead actor, with Jones beside him, and added a young boy to the cast, carrying the title Two and a Half Men. Now it's Two Men, a Lesbian and a Housekeeper.

The plot is getting more and more far-fetched and unbelievable. That, and the jokes are nothing new. Alan, get out of my Malibu beach house. Bring home a woman and sleep with her. Blah blah blah, what used to be funny is not funny the hundredth time. With or without Charlie Sheen, this show is years past its prime, and needs to be done. Eleven seasons is a good run. Jon Cryer is great, and deserves better than this. Charlie, you were the heart of this show. And it died when Charlie Harper died."
"With Charlie, the series was really funny. When Ashton replaced him, the actors became increasingly stupid and the gags became shallow and unwitting. The quality has dropped with Charlie's departure."
"Where once stood a proud and mighty hilarious comedy with Charlie Sheen now stands a terrible pile of garbage with Ashton Kutcher. If they had simply traded actors and kept the writing it would have been excellent, but does anyone else get the feeling that the writers left with sheen? Or it might be the fact that Charlie knew how to act in TV shows as where kutcher... well come to think of it where was he a good actor because in all the movies I remember him in he's always this really dumb guy who just walks around clueless. Perhaps he figured that would work on shows too, it didn't. Being a slacker in your movie carrier doesn't give you license to be an idiot in a beloved series, but thanks for ruining that for us well done producers you just firebombed a good show. 1/10 since season 9."
"I gave it a chance, I believed in this season, I tried to like it, very hard, despite everything, but I just can't stand anymore. This show is dead! And don't get me wrong, I know that Kutcher have made some decent work in the past, take The Butterfly Effect for example, which I simply love to watch. I love this movie so much that I try to make like there's never been two lame sequels to it. It's just this one movie and that's it.

As about one of my favorite sitcoms of all time, sorry, but as much as Kutcher tries, there's no salvation to it.

I mean, Charlie Sheen is lots of fun, he can be an a**hole as a person, I don't care, but in the series, I used to LMAO with him and the rest of the cast.

Even the worst episode with Sheen is far better than this travesty now that they call Two and a Half Men Season 9.

Five episodes. No laughs, not even giggles. I'm done. The show is pretty dead to me.

As long as they don't bring Charlie back to this, do not even consider calling me to watch this garbage again.

3 stars in memory of what this show used to be once. A funny as hell experience. Now nothing but a travesty of itself.

Two and a Half Men (2003 - 2011) R.I.P."
"The chemistry between Charlie (Sheen), Jon Cryer (Alan) and the young Angus T. Jones (Jake) is magical. Especially when Jake was the age of the elementary school he was fabulous. What a talented young boy! Also all the girlfriends of Charlie and Alan were hilarious.

They feel like a real family. And it looks like they are really having fun with each other. Holland Taylor (Evelyn) and Conchata Ferrell (Berta) also did a great job. Then Ashton Kutcher came in. He spoiled everything with his awful bad acting. The chemistry between everybody vanished immediately. It looked like the cast did not enjoy it anymore. So we stopped seeing the show. Tried though."
"As long as Charlie Sheen was there it was an awesome show. After he left the show, later seasons felt dud."
Two and Half Men remake whit Charlie Sheen ? It will definitely be successful once again ;) I love this 1-8 season series.
"In my opinion Two and a half men was one of the best TV show ever. I loved this show, it was very funny with likable characters and interesting storyline. Until the main character Charlie Sheen have been changed for Ashton Kutcher. I think that was a huge mistake. The show should have stopped with season 8. I rated it with 9 stars. Seasons 9 and 10 are quite watchable, but it is no more funny and it started to be awkward sometimes. It's not as good as before. My rating for these two seasons is 5.5. But after all I highly recommend this TV show for everyone who have not decided yet. Especially the first 8 seasons. You'll be satisfied and you're going to laugh a lot."
"This review is only for the first 8 seasons of the series. Because I heard a lot about how bad the last seasons were, I didn't even get to the point of starting watching them.

The writing: Good. Nothing special, but it's good: it has good jokes and the structure of the story is also good.

The acting: Very good from every actor! But in my opinion, mostly Charlie Sheen and Jon Cryer bring out their best.

The direction: Let's call it good. But that's just ""good"" too, nothing special. I think this is as good as a series like this can get.

So in summary: the first 8 seasons are good. They have funny jokes, great acting and good direction."
"I personally enjoyed this show a lot, especially when Charlie Sheen was on it. Now with Ashton Kutcher as the star, the show has died for me, and I don't watch it anymore.

In the time before Charlie Sheen's little breakup with the show, I enjoyed the show a lot. The jokes were humorous, the acting was great and I could easily point out the characters character. The usual shows I watch that have child actors, the child usually lacks in acting skills, but Angus T. Jones (Jake) was a great actor from the beginning.

I personally don't recommend this show as of the newest Season with Kutcher, just because the humor is dead and now the show seems like a drag, for Charlie was really the main character that made the whole plot fit together. Yet, I do recommend watching the episodes with Sheen, because I find those humorous."
"10/10 with charlie 1/10 without him....

its like taking the motor out of a lamborghini and replace it with 2 pedals for the driver. its not a lamborghini anymore. face it.

the whole concept of the show is based on charlies character. it makes absolutely no sense to continue without him. the only reason they do, they want the money so hard, since two and a half men was the most successful TV show. a lot of people say sheen went crazy, i say: charlie was right when he flipped out and offended the producers. it doesn't look like they love what they do, they just love the money. he wants double the money? pay him and get him back, only way to rescue a sinking boat. the show will be cancelled soon, if they continue like this."
"The show was great and was very fun to watch but the day Charlie Sheen left the show the show became boring. The old non-funny lame jokes and non-funny sexual acts to keep the show alive. They just kept on adding adult-scenes to attract the audience and they were successful in doing that but audience doesn't matter because the show was lame in last 4 seasons. There is no reason to watch last 4 seasons. I stopped watching the series when the 9th season started, truth is charlie sheen was the only man keeping the show together, the day he left, there was no reason left to continue watching the season!

Also excuse the english, am not an American nor British."
"What can I say? This show should have ended when Charlie left but now we have 100 episodes of garbage that will be on tv everyday for the rest of our lives. 10 stars for Charlie, minus 5 for that second idiot."
"I remember in 1993, X-Men the Animated Series is my obsession and I'm not the only one. For a lot of people in my country, 1993 - 1994 is the X-Men craze era. The said cartoon series was one of the highest-rated TV shows at the time. I was especially obsessed with Rogue. She's beautiful and sexy. She of superior strength and when she fights, she rocks!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Yet she can't be touched. She's an irresistible temptation to men, especially to Gambit who longs to touch her so much, when she can't be touched.

I was a sappy romantic at heart too so I'm always looking forward to moments between her and Gambit!!! And the people at my school were no different. Different people - different X-Men character favorites and obsessions, collection of X-Men comics and lots of talk about it during breaks, you name it. Even people over 25 watch it. It is little wonder, however, why there was all this fuss about X-Men. The characters' looks and personalities are charismatic and appealing to viewers. They are drawn as sexy and beautiful women and the men as beautiful and sexy as their female counterparts. Each has their own individual history and personalities which viewers simply find lovable and appealing. The plots and stories are exciting and interesting and there's no denying that the MUSIC at the beginning of every episode is REALLY CATCHY!!!!!!!!!!!!! The animated series was simply VERY WELL DONE!!! The fact that this animated series is one of the highest-rated and most-viewed Saturday morning programs in American history to date, that it is very popular in other countries aside from the U.S., and that it boosts sales of X-Men comics--as people who who didn't read x-men comics before this one started reading them as soon as they got obsessed with it--- are proofs that this is definitely one of the best cartoon series in 90s. In my opinion it is the BEST CARTOON SERIES, not just during the 90s but UNTIL NOW!!!!!!

X-Men shows a different idea of heroes. This is unlike Batman and Superman who are loved by ordinary people because they are heroes. X-Men, on the other hand, although fighting for peace and justice, defending their fellow mutants and ordinary men from harm in the process, are hated and feared by those they've sworn to protect. Humankind, that is. Still they continue to protect and defend mankind.

Marvel really did it right with this one and it could NOT be said that Batman and/or Superman animated series is/are superior than this one. X-Men The Animated Series(90s) is undeniably one of the most excellent, most watched and ultra-popular cartoon series up to this day!!!!!!!!"
"I was in my early teens when I first saw this cartoon version of 'X-Men' on television and it was what ignited my long-standing interest in the Marvel universe. If there was ever a lesson to be learnt about what it is to produce a faithful, involving adaptation (be it from a comic or a book) this show was the perfect example as it managed to successfully transfer the characters and plots from page to screen without dumbing down or altering things for the sake of making them 'cooler'.

The cartoon focused mainly on 'X-Men' favourites including Cyclops, Jean, Wolverine, Gambit, Rogue, Storm, Beast, Jubilee and, of course, Xavier. But there were also episodes involving characters in supporting roles such as Archangel, Bishop, Nightcrawler and Cable. In terms of villains, all the usual suspects of like Magneto, Sinister, Mystique and Apocalypse turn up at some point. Unlike the recent films, aimed at pleasing teenagers and casual cinema-goers, this series was more intent on depicting the characters properly so there is the same interactions as seen in the comics including the Scott/Jean/Wolverine triangle, the love/hate relationship between Gambit and Rogue and the sibling bond that Storm and Gambit share. It also wonderfully portrays Wolverine's darkly sarcastic side, which brings humour to the show.

While the films (and the childish 'X-Men: Evolutions') show the X-Men having rather calm, settled lives on the whole, this series gave a darker view of the universe, showing the team striving to do good in a world where much of humanity loathed mutants and saw them as the threat. It also tackled story arcs, like Onslaught, Dark Phoenix, Days of Future's End and Angel's transformation into Archangel, that appeared in the comic-verse in a way that retained the essence of the stories.

This was certainly one of the best cartoons to come out of the Nineties and still holds appeal to me even now that I'm an adult. In fact, I think a few of the time-travelling episodes would probably be a bit too complex for the usual eight- to twelve-year-old demography who watch Fox Kids. I'd highly recommend this to fans of the comics and those who enjoyed the films but felt they were too flat and want to see something that preserves the spirit of the comics."
"In my very own opinion, the X-Men cartoon series was arguably the closest remake of the X-men that fans could get and much more faithful to the comic books themselves than what the live action movies will ever be. The costumes were identical as the comics, the superheroes were as realistic as they were and the story lines were much more varied, exciting and believable. Wolverine, Storm, Gambit, Rogue, Cyclops, Jean Grey, Beast, Professor Xavier and Jubilee were as they were. The artwork was also excellent, but just what you'd expected from Marvel.

Whilst the films were in all a shambles in terms of the design and look of the characters, the cartoon series and Marvel have thankfully retained the originality, appeal and quality of the comics, and the appearances of which made the X-men one of the most successful comic book hero franchises in history. Another difference between the cartoon series and the films was the fact the creators of the show put a lot of emphasis on character development and the emotional plight of the mutants's own expectations of wanting to belong to the world and to feel accepted, which this has been addressed much better in the series than the film trilogy ever did. Therefore, the human interest aspect- no make that mutant interest aspect and the triumph over adversity tales of each and everyone of the X-Men members had more of a feel and resonance to it, of which we could empathise the characters with, and of which the films themselves fail to do because it just didn't translate well on the big screen.

Unlike the movies, the animated show had a raw ness and bite to each and every one of those characters that was totally devoid in the live action versions and it never managed to pussyfoot around the issues, as well as the story lines, of which again were far more realistic and believable.

This is what the movies themselves ought to have been like, but rather than leave things as they were, the directors Brett Ratner and Brian Singer decided to change a couple things round, without realising how much this would put die-hard and ardent X-men fans off. Why tamper with a classic formula? Besides, the film's disappointment shouldn't take away from the fact that the cartoon series is the best on- screen version of the X-Men.

Forget the films, either stick with the comics or go for this, the animated version instead."
"It's been a while since I last watched ""X-Men,"" the animated series from the early 1990s, but I do remember that this is/was one of the greatest comic book superhero shows I ever watched during my childhood. I was a reader of the Stan Lee-/Jack Kirby-co-created X-Men comics for Marvel Comics as a child - along with Spider-Man, who remains my favorite superhero, and the two Marvel Comics titles formed the cornerstone of my fascination with comic book superheroes. The ""X-Men"" titles struck a personal chord with me as I got older because of how its world re-defined people's hatreds and prejudices against each other to accommodate people with mutant powers being discriminated against by the powers-that-be. Being a black American, I instantly related to the plight of the X-Men and any other mutant character who was the target of those who ultimately wished the destruction of anyone with mutant powers. That was ultimately the greatest element about the comics, and this incredible animated series. It's the reason why I grew to deeply appreciate Marvel Comics more than any other comic book publisher in the industry. ""X-Men,"" ""Spider-Man: The Animated Series,"" and ""Batman: The Animated Series"" were all the reasons why during the early '90s, I loved comic book superhero cartoon shows.

10/10"
"The X-Men Animated Series was great, hands down. Sure, it wasn't the comic -- and yes, the X-Men lineup stayed the same through all six seasons... but it handelled very well. In some ways I wish the comic could have been more concise like the Animated Series was. Some guest characters (Dazzler, my favourite X-Man, for one) weren't portrayed very well, especially in the explenation of their mutant powers, but it was very cool to see it all piece together.

The X-Men had it's share of continuity problems, however. In season 1, for example, everything was loosely played off of the comics. For instance, the X-Men did NOT know Warren Worthington III (Angel/Archangel). Later on through the series, however, Angel is shown as an original X-Man. Iceman was also later guest-starred as an original X-Man, and Polaris was shown as a former X-Man as well. Other than that, though, the team is set as Wolverine, Rogue, Gambit, Cyclops, Storm, Jean Grey, Jubilee, Beast and Professor X. Some great storylines were the Phoenix Saga, Dark Phoenix Saga and the Phalenx Covenant.

Just about any X-Man you can think of was cameoed as well. Except for Shadowcat that is. Nightcrawler, Dazzler, Colossus, Havok, Wolfsbane, Cannonball, Longshot, and Rictor all stand fresh in my mind. It was truly a great series -- and it was very sad to see it cancelled, as it brought something more substantial to television -- a dream, a goal. Not talking sponges like you see on Nickelodeon. This was and will continue to be one of the greatest cartoons that graced Saturday-morning television."
"I love everything about X Men. The animation is very detailed and atmospheric, and the character designs especially with Wolverine are quite sophisticated for the time. The action sequences, which never suspended disbelief and had some wondrous elements for kids and adults alike to savour, have a lot of fluidity in that regard. The music is wonderful as well, the intro is one of the coolest of any animated series of the 90s(and there were a lot) and the background scoring manages to be beautiful and haunting. The writing is intelligent, sometimes affecting and sometimes humorous, though any sense of conflicting emotions are equally convincing, while the story lines are daring and always interesting and the characters right from charismatic Wolverine, sexy Rogue to the appropriately antagonistic villains are very well-written and likable. The voice acting is always expressive and never felt stereotypical, bland or overdone. In conclusion, a superb series. 10/10 Bethany Cox"
"I remember back in 1992 when this show debuted, I thought it was one of the best cartoons on the air, along with ""Batman: The Animated Series"". The characters had great powers but no one was so incredibly powered that they couldn't get knocked down and knocked around. Plus they were always getting on each others nerves. As cool as Wolverine and Gambit were, I always held great fondness for Cyclops and Beast, I guess because I admired Cyclops for being so stalwart and steadfast and Beast for being so damn smart, laid back and intelligent. Gambit's love/hate relationship with Rogue, the hottest virgin super-heroine in comic books, was always good for a laugh and only occasionally got dramatic but never so much that it got sappy. Professor Xavier, Storm, Jean, and Jubilee rounded out the cast of heroes with their own powers and self-doubts and dreams. Well, actually the only character who probably didn't benefit from the series was Jean Grey, who for some strange reason was always fainting in action scenes. I'm guessing the writers simply didn't have a good grasp of her character or a strong idea of how to make her powers look cool and dynamic compared to the weather controlling Storm, high flying super tanker Rogue or even fire work shooting Jubilee.

One of my few regrets/complaints about this show was that the X-Men's big villain, Magneto, was only a villain or rather a well meaning if twisted and tainted anti-hero for only the first two episodes in which he appeared, and so the role of #1 agitator to the X-Men went to Mr. Sinister during the 2nd season along with the usual stock villains of racist Americans. The first 3 seasons were probably the best, after that it kind of started to wane. Also I regret that Colossus and Night-Crawler were not regular members of the cast, as Night-Crawler was a very soulful character and Colossus, well, he's just so damn cool.

But these complaints are very minor in light of what was otherwise one of the best comic book to cartoon adaptations ever to air. Certainly superior to the now defunct Wolverine & the X-Men, though X-Men Evolution featured a stronger version of Jean Grey.

The X-Men later made some guest appearances on ""Spider-Man"", which had a lot of promise and brighter animation but ultimately squandered its potential. Captain America later guest starred in both X-Men and Spider-Man."
"X-Men is one of the perennial favorites in the Marvel catalog, maybe as well known now as Spider-Man, and seeing this TV series it's not hard to see why. This is taken, as far as I can tell from my limited knowledge of the original comics that featured the main cast assembled here (Cyclops, Wolverine, Rogue, Storm, Gambit, Jean Grey, Xavier, Jubilee), right from the source material, and it's a pleasure to see how the series in the first two seasons followed a fairly straightforward continuity. Indeed it's like going through a comic book series; you can't really jump in on any episode to really gage the plot (albeit there are some great stand-alone episodes, particularly in the second season where we get some backstories on Gambit and Rogue), though at the least you get an idea of who every character is and what their interests, powers, concerns and little dramas tend to veer toward.

This is not to say sometimes it can't get a little confusing; by the time it gets into time travel with Cable it can be a little crazy, especially in terms of how much affects what or why an apocalypse still seems to be taking place. But aside from that, it's a classic Saturday morning serial, with lots of adventure and action and colorful villains. And they're all given some meaty comic-boom dialog, too, and it's a step-up usually from the times in the movie series when they've tried to go too far (i.e. X3, Wolverine) in defining personalities. Here it's done just enough as to get a grasp of everyone, but relatively so. And along with the breakneck animation (some of it quite sophisticated for the time, some on par with the Ninja Turtles cartoons if not quite up there with Batman), there's the whole issue of being a mutant, the identity of it and how it is to be a human and an outsider in society that works its way into the show and theme in general.

It's got a message but it doesn't overstate it, it's got action that is believable enough so that we don't roll our eyes and incredible at times to keep the kids wondering (there's a moment where the flying-angel character in an episode asks Rogue how she can fly and she gives a shrug kind of answer, a perfect little comic-book moment), not to mention characters like Beast and Wolverine and Magneto, who are the kinds of icons that need strong storytelling to keep them interesting to new and old fans. This X-Men series, frankly, is the be-all-end-all for me, bad-ass and an all-around crowd-pleaser."
"After 16 years since its release and almost 11 after its last episode, I still think that X-Men TAS stills being the perfect animated series ever based on a comic book so powerful as X-Men ever was. I still miss it.

You can feel the difference between X-Men TAS and X-Men Evolutions with the ages. Today I'm 26 y.o. and until now I watch TAS and feel excited about it while I watch Evolutions and feel bored with those teenage jokes. TAS was an animated series for teenagers and adults, because it was fun for the kids and mature on its plot and all its stories were very consistent for the adult audience.

I must say that I like a lot the movie trilogy, but just because I'm a huge fan of the mutants, but the movies wasn't faithful to the comics at all. I agree that some changes were needed for the movies, but a lot was changed... and a lot change for the comics after the movies, and Evolution is the proof of that.

X-Men TAS was extremely faithful to the comics and a lot close to the comics stories. It was like seeing the comics in the TV. All the main character and villains were there, with all their powers, original costumes, personalities, all their stories were well explored during all the 5 seasons. The other supporting characters also had their important moments. The important stories like The Savage Island or The Genosha Island, Apocalipse and mainly (I SAID MAINLY) The Phoenix Saga and The Dark Phoenix Saga were masterpieces and I still watch to them till today like they were the real movies that I though one day X-Men would be, but never was.

They tried to insert some kind of Phoenix in the movies but it was a joke comparing to the importance of this entire saga in the comics, and TAS did an amazing experience with entire saga for over 9 episodes. I still think that all the Phoenix saga should become a movie series because it's a sci-fi epic that everyone would enjoy, and a sci-fi epic that the movie series fails to be in some moments.

Today the art work in TAS stills being something great because it was entirely colored by hands and not by computer. All the animated technique used in production are no longer in use by any kind of studio and that's another great thing to admire.

X-Men TAS is a strongly recommended series for those who enjoy a lot so loved mutants and also for those who became fans after the movies and don't know anything about them in the early years or think that Evolutions is a great piece of work. Yeah... Evolution is all about a great PIECE of work, while TAS is an ENTIRE great work."
"I just read a review to say its so bad, its unwatchable as an adult and its childish, IT WAS MADE FOR KIDS, adults didnt really watch cartoons back in the day or read comics as much as they do now. Of course its childish, it was morning TV for KIDS and guidlines were very strict compared to how they are now. Stop reviewing as adults and review for a child"
"It seems incredible to me that this crude cartoon is favourably compared to the stylish Batman, Superman and Justice League cartoons of the same era. The X-men is positively Neanderthal by comparison.

Firstly the art is hackwork. The backgrounds are usually routine or sometimes absent altogether. The characters are inconsistently drawn with faces changing from frame to frame. I challenge anyone to freeze-frame and honestly be able to recognise any character by their facial features.

Colour is ugly and inconsistent too, ie Wolverine's arms will sometimes be drawn yellow, like his costume,and then revert to its normal flesh colour. A minor detail, perhaps, by one that speaks to the low editorial standards at work. Another example of laziness is when the X-men go to Genosha supposedly incognito, but Gambit is still wearing his full costume, which sort of gives the game away! My only explanation for this is that he is so undistinguished looking that no one would recognise him out of costume? He is so undistinguished, apparently, that no one recognises him even IN costume, but they do recognise the incognito Storm.

Next, everything seems rushed. The series begins confusingly with Jubilee being pursued by sentinels. then in Xavier's mansion then back again being caught by the sentinels. No explanation as to why she is allowed to leave is given and the X-men do not seem to notice her absence. Characters appear without introduction and we are expected to know who they are? I can only imagine that well read fans of the comic book would know who's who because you would be lost otherwise. In the trial of the Beast, Sabretooth suddenly appears out of nowhere. I had to rewind to see if I had missed anything but I hadn't.

The stories themselves are mostly good, but they have been lifted from classic comicbooks, they should be. It must be said that the cartoon version does not add anything to the original. In most cases, these stories are presented in a simplified fashion which undermines the original intention; for example the suicidal sacrifice of Jean Grey was apparently too strong for children's TV and Proteus is turned into a childish version of one the X-men's best stories.

Although it improves in later series, early on there's no effort at any characterisation. The characters are stereotyped with their only interactions being aggression towards each other. Obviously the writers have taken the notion that conflict is the essence of drama literally but not allowed any time for getting to know each character. The most egregious example of this is Morph, who is unceremoniously killed off before we know anything about him, but, apart from a few melodramatic ""Morph's gone!"" this does not even have much impact upon the other X-men. Since there are no real characters, consequently dialogue is awful too, with some lines coming across as unintentionally funny.

Probably as a result of the bad writing, the vocal actors have little to work with and deliver hammy performances. Wolverine is constantly angry and others, such as Gambit, Cyclops and Cable are only marginally less so. Xavier's voice is just plain weird.

In the end, this is a cartoon with the look and psychological depth of a Scooby Doo cartoon. Nice enough for a Saturday morning (and undemanding audience) but nothing that can withstand repeated viewings like the DCU animations from the same period. To be fair. after the awful first series, it does improve. While it is still hideous to look at, the pacing and characterisation is a lot better. So I have upped my original grade."
"The X-Men animated series was a terrific try at bringing the ultra-popular comic book featuring mutant outcasts to the small screen. While the animation was amateurish and choppy at best, the voice over work was a particularly wonderful highlight. The stories were re-hashes of the plots from the comics' 30+ years in publication, and a few standouts included the Phoenix Saga, and its follow-up featuring the reconciliation between Scott Summers, alias Cyclops, and his father, the interstellar pirate/freedom fighter, Corsair."
"First of all let me say that I am not a comic nerd, I maybe owned a couple through my whole life (wolverine was my fav and probably because of this show). I have never liked other superhero shows (another critic said he liked the batman cartoon but that show blew, maybe i just didn't like the cartoon style). Basically what I am trying to say is that I am not a superhero guy but this show might be the best cartoon ever ...

You know those shows/movies you loved as a kid then re-watch as an adult and they just seem corny and/or stupid, boring, childish or just plain lame? (i remember loving ""labrynth"" the movie as a kid, re watched and realized its just a long and boring David bowie music video). I recently got all 5 seasons of X-men for my kids to watch because I remember absolutely loving it watching it new as a kid myself, it was my most anticipated cartoon (besides the simpsons) and I thought the kids would enjoy it...

the theme music gave me butterflies, so lets start there. What a theme song !!! )best ever maybe), so good I can't believe it brought out emotion in me and that is rare. The video for the intro is pretty cool too, love that explosion.

Now on to the show, a lot of reviews here hit it on the nose. The show is so complex and the characters are real. The opening scene of jubilee with her foster parents, man !!! TV shows still don't have the balls to put on content that real.

Gambit hitting on the cashier, man !!! so good.

The characters make jokes that are funny.

They get in each others faces.

The girls are more loving and the guys are cold.

OK i could go on and on so lets just finish by saying watch the damn show and lets never forget it. shows like this don't come along every day and i hope people enjoy it for a long time.

OK i feel like i should throw a couple negatives in just so i don't seem to biased (remember i am not a comic geek so i cant talk about comic book accuracy) just from the first episode though ...

1. I don't like how gambit is just waltzing around the mall in his costume, storm and rogue were both in plain clothes though so i don't know why gambit had to be rocking his outfit?

2. The giant robot is hiding behind a tree as jubilee walks by going to her parents house to check on them ... please.

OK thats about it for now

um fav character has gotta be gambit, love the accents

this show embraces diversity but not in a captain planet kind of way

alright i am out

thanks"
"I recently completed all five seasons (76 episodes) of X-Men: The Animated Series (1992) on Disney+. The series centers on Professor Xavier and his school for mutants, mutants who faced struggles including victimization in experiments, rejection by their families, and societal dismissal. Xavier offers them a home, but societal prejudices often pull them back into chaos.

Co-created by Mark Edward Edens (10 episodes of The Real Ghostbusters), Eric Lewald (Trollz), and Sidney Iwanter (Flight of the Living Dead), the series features voice talents including Cedric Smith (Heavy Metal), Cal Dodd (Goosebumps), Lenore Zann (Trigger), George Buza (The Adventures of Sinbad), and Chris Potter (The Pacifier).

X-Men: The Animated Series brilliantly depicts the X-Men universe, showcasing the complexities of its characters and the ongoing battle of those deemed different by society. While Wolverine tends to steal the spotlight, the dynamic between Rogue and Gambit is enjoyable, Beast is portrayed as an amazing character, and the relationship between Cyclops and Jean Grey offers a unique and tragic love story. The series delves into the characters' pasts, allowing them to bond after each ordeal. It offers deeper messages than it's often given credit for, with a perfect conclusion fitting for the X-Men universe. The animation, classic '90s style, has aged well, and there's little to fault in this series.

In conclusion, X-Men: The Animated Series is a timeless gem in the superhero genre and an absolute must-see. I would score this a 10/10 and strongly recommend it."
"Story: People known as mutants born with a superpower disability must try to persuade the humans that they are peaceful while they battle other mutants.

Production: Perfect

Main intelligence: 5. Humans are dumb because they are okay with the Fantastic 4 but are not okay with mutants.

Highlight: The story, battles, characters, this show did not have any limits. It was non-stop X-mening.

Should you watch this show?: Yes. If you like superheroes, the best animation, non-yokeness, non-cringefest then this is the show for you. It's the perfect show. If you are a fan of X-men and Mutants, there are plenty in this show to interact with. Almost every story from the comics were covered in this show.

Sadly, the shows that followed this perfect iCON was a step-down."
"Grew up with this cartoon as well as Spiderman and Batman and looking back how lucky were we to have such brilliant adaptations? All the favourite characters are here, both good and evil, including Rogue, Wolverine, Storm, Jean Grey, Charles Xavier and Cyclops appearing in the majority of episodes while there are many other characters coming and going through-out including Magneto, Apocolypse, Juggernaut, Mystique and so many more. Suffice to say, if you have a favourite X-Men character the chances are they'll show up here. The episodes themselves all intertwine with each other, with storylines including time-travel, the fight for mutant rights, the Morlocks and even relationships between the X-Men and their foe's taking many episodes to come to a resolution which shows a level of intelligence that is quite rare in the television cartoon field. Any X-Men fan will be gripped from the start. The animation is wonderful, the battles quirky and fast-paced and the voice acting is also top-notch. The whole show is quality and hasn't really aged much."
"I'm sorry but this show is rated way too high. I think most people are blinded by their nostalgia.

I didn't watch this show as a child. I grew up watching Batman: TAS and Spider-Man TAS which I absolutely loved and still love to this day. I re-watch those shows pretty regularly even as an adult.

I tried to watch a couple episodes of X-Men TAS since it was rated so highly on here. I found it pretty unwatchable. It's pretty obvious to me that this show was made strictly for children, without any concern for making it interesting to adults too.

It is really preachy to kids about accepting and tolerating people who are different from you. This is a good message, but they hammer it in literally every episode. Also, the dialogue is really bad at times and Wolverine is almost useless since he can't use his claws on anyone except robots. There are countless nonsensical moments where the plot or the premise just doesn't add up. It's not a bad show for children, but I can't watch it as an adult."
"In my humble opinion, this is the greatest cartoon of all time. Certainly the greatest comic-book adaption of all time. For all you kids out there, if you want to know why the 80s and 90s were the glory years for cartoons, go on youtube and check out some of these episodes. The animated series is certainly exceptionally better than the lousy films. If the X-men films had been a tenth as good as the cartoons, they would have been awesome movies. The first three seasons were the best, the series wasn't quite up to snuff for the last two seasons (but it's still better than most of the stuff on TV nowadays). Season 3 was my personal favorite, as it featured an amazing adaption of the Phoenix and Dark Phoenix Saga. But I also loved the Mr. Sinister storyline in season 2. And the sentinel storyline in season 1 was well-produced as well, culminating in my personal favorite episode, FINAL DECISION, where Magneto helps the X-Men take out the sentinels and Mastermold."
"The writing was terrible, and so was the quality of the animation work. At times the physical movements of the characters is discontinuous and unnatural, not to mention the hastily drawn characters and the low frame rate. Perhaps the writing does reflect that of the original comic, but c'mon, guys, that was Stan Lee. He may have created some great characters and plot lines (and even that is disputed at times), but as far as dialogue, he's always been a hack.

Don't get me wrong, I love the X-Men, having read them when I was a kid in the 70s, watched the movies, as well as X-Men Evolution, all of which are good, but the 90s animated series was lousy."
"This show will not appeal to everyone, however, if you go into it with an open mind and let go of your expectations, you may just enjoy it. A lot. Personally I had a hard time getting into it for the first 2 episodes and almost ditched it. I'm glad I didn't. What a wild ride it is. Imagine ""Alice in Wonderland"" crossed with ""X-Men"" crossed with a brilliant writer's acid-induced trip. It's wild and crazy but strangely enough it makes a lot of sense and it's not hard to follow. Brilliant, one of a kind show I will not forget anytime soon. May have to watch it again soon."
"Season 1: 9 stars (3 viewings, 7/10/2024)

The differentest Marvel thing I've seen. So weird and awesome. Artsy but not fartsy. Visually mesmerizing. So many great shots. I also love that you have to figure stuff out on your own. You are rarely spoon-fed any info. Intelligent and unique. So many times I thought, ""I've never seen anything like that.""

Season 2: 5 stars (3 viewings, 7/22/2024)

A lot slower with a bit of a filler-y feel at times.

The first season was pretty scary, at times it felt like a horror movie, and I loved that aspect. This season, it's not so prevalent. The first season has lots of stuff that's not explained or difficult to understand, but I always felt like I had a grasp on what was really happening. This season I regularly felt like I didn't fully know what was going on. The first season WAS SO WEIRD AND DIFFERENT in a way I love, and I always felt like it's based in the real world, with the exception of some aspects like mutant abilities. This season seems to try to be weird for the sake of being weird, and I feel like the show now takes place in a fantasy world (submarine-looking doughnut vehicle, mustache ladies with auto-tune voices).

Having said all that, I still thought the season was pretty awesome and so stylish once again. The finale was good, and I look forward to seeing where season 3 goes.

EDIT: Rewatching the series, it was extremely difficult to get through this season. It's one of the worst examples of filler I have seen. Plot progression is minimal. There is a 3 episode run where we are in nearly the exact same place story-wise. Entire episodes of background or flash-sideways like the later seasons of Lost.

It makes it difficult to recommend this show when you have to stick it out through this season. It's unfortunate because you can feel the return to awesomeness IMMEDIATELY in season 3.

Season 3: 7 stars (2 viewings, 7/23/2024)

Really awesome, continues to be different and unique. Exciting and crazy. There are a few parts that are super creepy and freaky. But the finale was a let-down."
"This is one of the most creative, intelligent, visually unique works of art in entertainment. Shows like this should last years with the amazing story telling it imagines. Hope the same team worx up another original. We need it in this word of reboots and retellings of the same old stories."
"*** some mild spoilers ahead ***

""What is your name?"" Jesus asked.

""My name is Legion,"" he replied, ""for we are many."" (Mark 5:9)

I hope you'll forgive me for starting this review by citing this (rather obvious) excerpt from the bible, but I just couldn't resist. Apart from these opening lines, I'll try to avoid any spoilers for the show, so you won't read anything specific about the storyline here. As with all my reviews, this is supposed to give you an overall impression of the show without giving away any details regarding the plot.

For those among you who, like me, love some of the slightly weirder superheroes out there (especially of the mutant kind and preferably in the X-Men universe) but feel most of those guys' screen outings so far were either constricted by the 2-hour format or held back by the need to appeal to mainstream audiences, I'm happy to report there is finally a full length TV-show that dares to fully embrace the craziness of its source material without taking any prisoners. The show's name is 'Legion' (and I'm already pretty sure its fans will be many), and compared to its central character David Haller, even Deadpool looks almost sane.

Following the storyline may seem a little difficult (at least at the beginning) for 'Legion' plunges us head first into the confused mind of its hero, and the narrative is - deliberately - often just as fractured as David Haller's personality. Right from the start this show makes it very clear how committed it is to convey its protagonist's unstable state of mind - and boy does it succeed: through David's eyes we experience an often terrifying (albeit colorful) world where we can never be sure what's real and what's imagined; nor can we get a grasp on where we are, when we are, or even WHO we are.

But this trip down the rabbit hole is well worth taking (even if it does turn into a horror trip at times) for it's a psychedelic ride that has been designed by very talented people. Creator Noah Hawley, who has already given us the excellent show 'Fargo', obviously knows what he's doing, and watching the show feels like listening to a perfectly composed concept album from a seventies rock band (btw, watch out for a cool Pink Floyd reference). The cast is terrific (especially Dan Stevens as David Haller); the visuals and the production design are a wonderfully weird mix of retro and modern elements which fits David's distorted perception of time and reality like a glove, and the mystery surrounding David as he desperately tries to cut through the haze and figure out what's going on will keep you glued to the screen throughout.

Insanity is a tricky subject to tackle, and the possible pitfalls are many; present it with too much levity and you risk the accusation that you're making fun of people with a terrible illness - yet if you portray it as tragic and bleak as it often is (I am saying that as someone who has a family member who suffers from schizophrenia) you will lose your audience. So to find the right tone here was not an easy thing to do, but I believe the show - just as Marvel did in the comic books - does an outstanding job at never coming across disrespectful while still offering fantastic entertainment.

So to sum up my first impression: 'Legion' represents a refreshingly different side of Marvel (compared to the films and shows based on Marvel Comics' more ""grounded"" creations that we've seen so far) and by fully embracing the source material's ""weirdness"" the show is a testament to just how insanely (in the true sense of the word) inventive and versatile Stan Lee and his band of brothers were/are. This show is wilder, more surreal and generally much, much crazier than your average superhero story and there are moments where you feel reminded of the works of David Fincher, Charlie Kaufman or even David Lynch. I'd highly recommend it especially to adult comic book fans and those among you who don't demand everything be explained within the first episode. Personally, I feel this is Marvel at its best and most complex: 9 stars out of 10.

"Legion is art, it is not a Sitcom, neither a show that you binge watch on Netflix, Legion is a like an exhibition in a museum, you cannot binge watch art. Every episode is unique and visually magnificient. It is LSD and psychedelic without any drugs. Actually you should not be stoned and watch Legion, your brain would explode."
"The show has been so well planned with ideas, plots, and themes, spread over such a wide breadth of time, it's taken me several re-watches to fully grasp the masterpiece it is. Adding to that is how brilliant it is, with deep insight. It's a show for creators of shows: a shows' show. Of the hundreds of series I've watched, this is one of my top 3."
A visual masterpiece and an incredibly compelling narrative. It's a hallucinogenic mind trip that you'll remember.
"This is a very different show. It's unique, well acted and the pacing is great. The writing and story development is intelligent and sophisticated. You're not spoon fed, but required to think about what plays out and motivated to discover the depths of the characters. A fun ride and worth the watch! Wish there was more quality programming like this."
"I enjoyed the first season of Legion. The first season had a tension to its style. There was this uncertainty to reality that kept me fascinated. Every silly, strange surreal moment was like a relief to that tension. By season 2 it feels like the rug has been pulled out from under the show's plot, and they're left dancing in midair with nothing to hold them up but a fun style, dance numbers, and psychedelic rambling.

I'm going to keep watching in hopes that it gets back on track. But if I'm going to just be watching a new song and dance routine in every episode, or another psychedelic gag because ""wahaa-wehee-why-not?"" then I'm gonna tune out."
"This show is absolute brilliance, the creators should be proud.

It's fresh, fun and so on the edge of ""what the heck is going on?"" yet I don't get completely lost, a feat not easy to pull off in film i'm sure.

The layers, the sets, the music, the acting, the craziness, brilliant! Please don't let this show stop Well done all involved"
"The same curse that plagued the X-Files has now happened to my poor Legion. Once Season 1 wrapped and FX moved production from Vancouver to L.A., the heart and soul of the Show seemed to disappear; I found I had to almost force myself to watch new episodes because I just lost interest.

Season 1 was very original and has style in the way the stories were told. The writing, pacing, acting, and especially the production design were all top notch and really made the show stand out. At the end of the season I was super hyped about what Season 2 was going to offer.

Right from the get go, Season 2 seemed to fall flat. The story arc of Farouk was drawn out way too long and could have been presented so much better. For a character that has this much importance to the Legion storyline, the writers and production team sure succeeded in phoning it in. Even the ""look-at-my-fancy-artsy-fartsy-reverse-camera-framing-because-it's-art"" shots that are obligatory in Noah Hawley productions somehow seemed contrived and slapped together with no real purpose.

Yawn. So much potential, wasted.

Season 1 - 10/10 Season 2 - 5/10"
"The first season was great, I'd give it 9/10, really great show. But the 2nd season....oh boy....do you remember Heroes? Well this is about the same case...everything went down south with everything further....at least Heroes had a decent season 2, and then terrible 3 and 4, which is better than I can say for this. It just keeps repeating lines and sentences for idiots, terrible story, half of nearly every episode is either really stupid or without any meaning...if you watched season no. 1. leave it at that...have a good memory of this show....cause after season 2 you ceritanly wont have one...."
"I'm giving this show ten out of ten because i'm genuinely thrilled every time i see a new episode. You *never* know whats gonna happen and the show keeps f*cking with your mind just enough to keep everything interesting but giving you exactly what you need to keep on waiting for more. Also, it's a freaking beautiful. I could watch it just because it's so perfectly shot. I get that everyone is not gonna like this, but for me this is pure bliss. Every time."
"While part of the Marvel Universe, Legion is an odd-man-out, neither part of the big budget Disney cinematic universe or the Netflix version of the Marvel universe. It also has the best acting, writing and direction of any of them and a more mature approach. It's a cerebral, surreal sci-fi mutant show. If you are a comics fan, the fact of Chris Claremont & Bill Sienkiewicz involvement in this tells you almost all you need to know -- it successfully carries both of their styles onto a TV screen. Claremont wrote many of the most legendary story arcs for the X-Men. Sienkiwicz is a brilliant comic artist, emphasis on artist -- he often works with paint and mixed media to create comics that look like fine art. The writing and direction is complicated, non-linear, and accomplished, verging on avant garde. There is immense attention to detail and editing, artistically-framed scenes. The acting is a cut above other Marvel shows (although Cage gets an honorable mention) and they've gathered a cast that works great together. The psychological, Lynch-ian freaky edginess that Sienkiewicz infused in all his work is present. It's not perfect, it takes some risks that don't work (like season 2 ep.5 -- tedious and anti-climactic), but it is freaky & cool."
"No spoilers. No plot points. You do not need them in a review of this show. Watch it and feel the performances.

Dan Stevens is a force of nature, in this story he literally is & his screen presence is a growing maelstrom. I first knowingly crossed his path in The Guest & have not looked back since (comparable with Matthew McConaughey in Killer Joe). The story is vague & intriguing from the beginning with growing enchantment as the episodes stack-up.

Sure. I'm a comic book geek from the 1980's, but Noah Hawley seems like he has more than his ducks in a row for this project. As SONY/Fox has often mis-stepped with the X- Men and its creative use of characters and story lines, LEGION seems to be avoiding the potholes, while creating a new amalgam of story from the past to forging ahead with a cohesive story.

Aubrey Plaza's performance is delightfully off-beat and maniacal.

I could list the positives for every actor and their character, literally the casting (and execution) seems perfect at this point (through episode seven).

Love it!"
"If you are wondering whether or not to start watching, DO! Don't listen to these rands who reviewed this terribly because of substance, Carnivàleness (wha?) and plot. They don't understand what is happening, and they don't like it so they are venting their frustrations. Watch the first episode, and if you love not knowing what is happening, and what will happen next, you are in for the best TV series out right now!"
"I am not a big fan of Agents of shield and agent carter so if you love those you might hate this one...

That being said, this is the first Marvel produced series that goes in deep with character development, not to undermine Netflix's efforts but they always use the same formula for their defenders series.

This show has amazing performances, unbelievable depth and above all: it talks about a very unknown superhero son of a very known superhero.

If you happen to like psychological thrillers and throw a bit of Marvel universe into it, please go binge the hell out of this show, you will not regret it"
"I loved season 1. It was new, different, and had a great storyline. Each week I would wait impatiently for the next episode. Each episode was a new adventure worth the wait. The characters are quirky, but it works. It is what you would expect in such an environment.

Then came season 2. I don't know what happened after season 1, but it became completely derailed. Tangent doesn't describe how far askew the 2 seasons are. It's like the writers completely forgot there was a first season and said ""Let's start again and make it really weird"".

I can only hope that the third season will be more like the first."
"This is the strangest, most creative TV series I think I've ever seen, and it's amazing. The story line is strong and ticks away with interesting characters and great (and sometimes pretty trippy) visual effects. Scenes sometimes get mixed in with musical numbers to great effect. Think people being disintergrated and transformed to ""Swinging on a star"", Mind battles represented by disco dance offs and David engaging in an epic psychic fight with Farouk over a desert landscape to the chords of ""Behind blue eyes"". Everyone seems perfectly cast and commits to the roles they're given with great performances.

Gone are the mindless CGI fights in the sky with beams which are so prevalent in superhero flicks, this one is a mind bender which makes you think. It's also obviously designed for mature teenagers to adults rather than being family friendly with mature themes.

The arc of the story is great. Apparently the director had a story he wanted to tell, and planned it into a set number of seasons. While I would have loved to have seen more, that's perhaps the hallmark of a great movie or TV series. It has a great story that is paced right and leaves you feeling great about it, rather than continuing to milk a series well past the ideas have dried up and it's there for $$ only. It's also interesting to note that it would have been cancelled except one of the higher ups wanted to see the rest of the series and so greenlit it. I am thankful to that exec. It's sad more people don't have your taste (and is why so many good fantasy series get cancelled after a single season.)

I guess in conclusions if you're looking for something a bit different, with a well produced strong, mature themed, fantasy storyline and characters you can get invested in, give Legion a go. It's a shame it is so under rated as a show. One can only hope this crew gets another series they can have free reign to make."
"American Crime Story is absolutely one of the best anthology series that's ever been made. I was not expecting the series to be so gripping and entertaining, every season and every story told has been fantastic so far. Everyone will have their favorite but there's no denying that they're all good. Personally I've liked them in order from season one being the best and so on. Each season has been nominated for numerous awards, everything from the acting to the writing has been nominated and all have been very deserving. Ryan Murphy has created so many successful shows over the years but American Crime Story still remains his best. I'm looking forward to all the future seasons still to come. If they're anywhere close to as good as these first few have been then they'll definitely be worth the time."
"American Crime Story is such an amazing show. The acting and writing are some of the best that's been on TV in years! The storytelling is so good that it just sucks you in and won't let go till the end! If you really want to know how good this show is all you have to do is read through the reviews! It's one of the best shows based off of true stories that I've ever seen! It's an anthology series where each season tells some of the most incredible true stories that have taken place. Season 1: The People vs. O. J. Simpson, Season 2: The Assassination of Gianni Versace, Season 3: Impeachment (the Bill Clinton/Monika Lewinsky scandal) and the upcoming Season 4 which will be based off Studio 54. Obviously some seasons are better than others but they're all really good, the best seasons are pretty much in order 1, 2 and then 3."
Darren Criss as Andrew Cunanan just Amazing!!! The writing excellent!! The whole cast just mesmerizing! This series continues to surprise me!
"The People vs O.J Simpson & The Assassination of Gianni Versace are both outstanding mini-series. Both, are completely two true events so it's hard to compare, if not at all.

From watching both of the series you can tell how much thought, research and care that the exec producers, director and cast(s) put into both of the mini-series in order to portray the events and every person correctly. The two series are outstanding and so well thought out and it's incredible to watch, they both feel so natural and realistic when you're watching them!

I started watching American Crime Story by watching The Assassination of Gianni Versace and I was absolutely hooked from the first episode. Then, I started watching The People vs O.J Simpson and the same thing happened. Both of the casts from American Crime Story are outstanding and their portrayals are fantastic, I can see why American Crime Story has been nominated and has won many awards for the two mini-series.

What I love the most about American Crime Story is that they don't just focus on the one side (e.g., People vs O.J Simpson and focusing that he's guilty (again, just an example!)) but they focus on both sides equally and allows you to see it on both sides for a further understanding of the two events which in my opinion a lot of people who have tried to make a series like American Crime Story have really flopped on.

American Crime Story is the only murder/crime/thriller genre-based series that has me absolutely hooked and itching for the next episode/season!

Ryan Murphy, you are an absolute genius! Roll on Season 3!"
"When I read the critic's reviews of this fascinating portrayal of the trial of OJ Simpson, the most common complaint was John Travolta's performance. So I was expecting to find it a bad, cheesy performance and everyone else to be great.

Instead, I thought Travolta did an excellent job as a supercilious attorney who finds himself increasingly outside his own case. True, Travolta has had so much plastic surgery that he looks like he was sewn together by a dollmaker, but his performance is, while not as notable as the really terrific performances by Nathan Lane and, more surprisingly, David Schwimmer, it's a solid performance.

The truly awful performance is by Cuba Gooding as O.J.

When I watched the movie, I thought Gooding seemed wrong based on my vague memories of O.J. I'm not a sports fan, I didn't follow the trial, which at the time I thought of as just another lurid celebrity crime, and I'd only seen Simpson in a small part in a movie years ago. I thought Gooding's whiny, unpleasant, crybaby performance seemed untrue to that memory, but I couldn't be sure.

Then I watched the terrific documentary series. O.J., Made in America, and I realized that Gooding was really horrible. He lacked O.J.'s famous charm, and instead came across as ineffectual where the documentary portrays O.J. as a strong force in his own defense.

If you've never seen Simpson at all, perhaps the performance would seem fine, but it's an absolutely wretched performance from the point of view of verisimilitude. It's easily the biggest flaw in an otherwise gripping portrayal.

Why the critics didn't notice that I can't say."
"I barely knew about the OJ Simpson scenario so everything about that is glorious while being outrageous! I'd like to see the second season for now I am the middle of season 1, it's quite enjoyable and intriguing. Ryan Murphy the creator/writer is a mastermind for many projects, I would definitely recommend this show."
"Telling the story of the murder of Gianni Versace (Edgar Ramírez) at the hands of Andrew Cunanan (Darren Criss), what's especially interesting about this season of American Crime Story is the narrative structure. The opening scene of the first episode sees the murder, and the show then goes backwards, with each episode set earlier than the previous one, an achronological structure that unifies form and content; this isn't about a murder, it's about how Cunanan became a serial killer.

Within this, the show deals with two interrelated issues; 1) the concept that one must work hard to be successful, and 2) the desire to be remembered. Cunanan is obsessed with the second, but unwilling to acknowledge the first, despite his conviction of his own greatness. His attitude is nicely critiqued by Versace himself (""Life isn't about convincing people you can do great things. It's about doing them""), and the last shot masterfully encapsulates much of Cunanan's deepest existential fears. For all that, however, the season is good, but not great. The last two episodes are far and away the strongest, especially 's appearance as Modesto, Cunanan's detestable father, but, overall, it isn't a patch on 'The People v. O.J. Simpson'."
"My only complaint about Season 2 is that there is to much conjecture about Cunanan's relationship with his some of his victims. We see an entire episode about him traveling with David, conversations they have, David's reluctance to escape...no one but Andrew and David knows what really happened in the apartment or the days following, or what conversations took place. Maybe Cunanan had a gun on him the entire time. Same with Miglin and the discussions about his Space Needle, or Miglin willingly allowing Cunanan to tape him up. Things may have in fact been very different."
"Finished watching the first season.

-Sarah Paulson was fantastic as always

-David Schwimmer has a lot more range as an actor than I thought

-Selma Blair was extremely convincing as Kris Jenner and also has range

-Same with Connie Britton

Overall this was extremely well played."
"This series is riveting, well directed, fast-paced and informative. The casting is marvelous with one little exception: OJ Simpson!! Cuba Gooding is a fantastic actor, but he completely fails to portray OJ Simpsons incredible charm and charisma that actually enabled him to sliver through years of abusive behavior and the cold-blooded double murder. Gooding is reactive and unsophisticated, while the cocksure Simpson is just missing. This is an incredible failure of casting where the remaining characters are spot on and compelling. Why not Dwayne Johnson or someone with the physical charisma and cool? Travolta deserves great kudos for taking this on, but one has to wonder why he allowed the utter miscasting of the major role. At any rate, this is a worthwhile series to watch and it surely is award-rich."
"The case of O.J. Simpson is one that received wide scale media coverage and attention with the events being closely followed by many and is now the topic of season 1 of FX's new biographical crime drama, American Crime Story. However despite this, this show manages to remain just as gripping and haunting as the case was in real life.

The acting is across the board incredibly strong with not a weak performance among the main ensemble; Cuba Gooding Jr. and John Travolta in particular stand out. The writing is sharp, never is it overly formulaic or mundane but understandable and real, tension is built tremendously from the dialogue alone. But above all the direction is excellent, the tone is established straight from the beginning and it is crafted to such a high quality.

There is rarely a dull or wasted moment throughout, the story and pacing remains tight with no parts lacking in comparison to the soaring heights. The show, as said in the title of this review, is both evocative and powerful. The some of it's parts truly do this story justice and will more than likely stir something within you that compels you to keep watching and to examine this story in much more detail. As far as crime dramas go, this feels, to a certain extent, rather fresh and different in comparison to what has come before.

The show looks set to keep reaching new heights and it is off a magnificent start."
"I enjoyed the first series revolving around the OJ Simpson murder trial, the second series is all about the assassination of fashion designer Gianni Versace.

The emphasis throughout the series on the serial killer Andrew Cunanan rather than Versace himself, although we do get to see a good amount of backstory on Versace also.

We get a real raw insight into Cunanan's psychotic mind, background and his shocking killing spree. It is a very gripping series and Darren Criss played the role of murderer Cunanan absolutely outstandingly and in my opinion deserves an award for his portrayal of this complex character.

My only criticism is the timeline jumps were confusing at times, when there's a week between episodes and each episode centering on a different year and back and forth rather than chronologically, I did get confused at times of what took place when. It did all come together though in the final episode."
"I tried to take this program seriously, but I kept seeing one extreme stereotype after another -- chubby, silly Monica, trashy Paula, anorexic Ingraham, and greedy, vindictive Tripp etc. The male characters are just as bad. The Isikoff so-called journalist is pathetic. No reflections on the actors as I assume they're doing their best. This display generates no sympathy or understanding for any of these people. If it's meant to be taken seriously --- then Epic Fail."
"Honestly the best television I have ever watched. A masterpiece told in reverse, superbly acted and directed. The missing pieces of the story are filled in, in a way which gives us empathy and sympathy for all involved, helping us to understand what went wrong and that life is not black and white but grey at the edges. I was gripped."
"At first I thought who needs to see all this again but once I started watching it I was hooked. The pilot moves quickly from discovery of the bodies (and they are shown) to fleeing down the highway in the Bronco. There are so many details and people that come flooding back and it's interesting to see things put together in a quick moving episode. Lots of details are included that you won't have pictured in your mind at the time because they didn't come out all at the same time in sequence. With race, money, abuse, celebrity it's still the crime of the 20th century.

The A list cast is hit and miss. Cuba Gooding is an enthusiastic actor but too small in size to play OJ. He looks shorter than the other male actors around him. Should have chosen someone more physically imposing. Sarah Paulson looks enough like Marcia Clark with the wig. Surprisingly David Schwimmer as Robert Kardashian looks like him if you check out photos. John Travolta as Shapiro has some strange eyebrows but he is fascinating to watch. Selma Blair as Kris Kardashian is also a good fit. Connie Britton looks a bit too healthy to be Faye Resnick but these are all people you like to see on screen. The link with the Kardashians is quite interesting to watch.

Well done and very voyeuristic and entertaining."
"This is just excellent.

First rate productions are the best way to attract a first rate cast. Excellent writing of course, brilliant dialogue as well as character design. Another reviewer said that it was better than the real thing - it is. I remember absolutely hating Marcia Clarke and here she is very well played and not overly done. She is very watchable - in real life I had to turn her off very often.

The actors Kenneth Choi and Mr. Courteny B Vance have roles of a lifetime and they are running with them. The intricacies of Judge Ito and the boundless energy and passion of Johnnie Cochran are captivating and very well casted.

Particularly informative is interactions between the lawyers on both sides. It is well paced and focused, it flows cleanly from one scene to another. I wish more programming could flow from FX."
"The series so far follow the O.J. Simpson trial and the Andrew Cunanan murder spree and both are hooking and must see tv. The acting is top class and storyline keeps you interested and anticipating the next episode throughout both series'. I hope there is a series 3 as both these series made me research both events after I finished. 10/10, 5/5, amazing, must see."
"This whole series has been fantastic so far but I'll speak specifically to no. 1. I grew up in the 80s and so remember the OJ trial quite well. This series really captures how much we were all captivated by this story of alleged murder and how there were so many twists and turns. It captures the media farce that went on and how there was so much public denial. The actors do a tremendous job, notably John Travolta as one of the lawyers. His range was really showcased in this drama- I loved it! There's not a single dull moment in this series and this includes the subsequent seasons about Versace and Clinton. Looking forward to what comes next. 9/10."
I think the role of Leainsky is badly miscast. Aside from that it's decent enough for a tv show. Not as good as the earlier seasons though.
"American Crime Story is an American anthology series from FX and acts as a sister series to America Horror Story. Accordingly, each season revolves around a completed criminal case that has caused a stir in recent decades. The format was created by Scott Alexander and Larry Karaszewski.

""American Crime Story"" shows really interesting cases in the first two seasons, which are presented really well with excellent actors and good storytelling.

The series has real binge-watching potential for every crime thriller fan.

I didn't see Season 3 because the case didn't sound that interesting to me right now."
"Having lived through this, I find it a bit biased in the Clinton's favor. It tries to make you sympathetic for Bill Clinton. With Monica Lewinski being a producer, I do not know how she allowed the casting for her character. The look is just wrong, she was not that heavy. Clive Owen does not look much like Clinton did, but he nailed the mannerisms and speech. If you close your eyes, you can see Bill Clinton. Then there is Hillary. No matter how hard I try, I only see Edie Falco. Did she not even try to sound or act like her?"
"Firstly, on the casting. The actress portraying Monica Lewinsky is just horrible, acting-wise and the physical similarity is just way off! The only positive thing is the great acting of Sarah Paulson. The voices of the actresses portraying Paula Jones and Monica Lewinsky is just annoying."
"Friends kept trying to convince me to watch this. I told them I didn't want to think about Andrew Cunanan or look at a facsimile. Well, this isn't about him, it Is mostly about his victims, as it should be.

Excellent writing, acting and production. Judith Light and Penelope Cruz are standouts among an excellent cast.

Ricky Martin was AWFUL."
"Great series except for Penelope Cruz. Her natural accent is way too heavy to even try to change or do any other accents. You can tell she is struggling. Plus, Dontella is awful looking in real life. I think she was a bad choice for this. Darren Criss is great!"
"Dexter is the show I have been waiting for my whole television watching life! The complex and damaged characters, the twisted plot line and Dexter's foster dad grooming him, educating him, to make him the perfect avenger,its all so intoxicating! I am breathlessly anticipating the next episode. This show is not only well acted, with each and every main character holding my full attention, but written with such deep intensity that I find it absolutely irresistible! I really find it difficult to wait and see more of how Dex was traumatized as a child, more of Harry's lessons, more of the growing relationship with Rita, more of the ice truck killer, more forensics...More of this great show period. Kudos to all involved...this show will surely be a huge hit!"
"Dexter is absolutely, without a doubt, one of the best shows ever created! It follows Miami PD blood splatter expert Dexter Morgan (Michael C. Hall) as he both solves murders and commits them too. He only murders bad people who've gotten away from the law. Being a blood expert he's able to outmaneuver the police at every turn. It's a thrilling, one of a kind TV show that will keep you at the edge of your seat throughout the entire series. Michael C. Hall is perfect as Dexter and the rest of the supporting cast is just as fantastic! Yes, the ending was terrible but like Game of Thrones, Lost (or any other show with a bad final episode), a few bad episodes at the end doesn't spoil what an overall great show it was and that's what Dexter is...a GREAT show."
"I read Lindsay's excellent books - Darkly Dreaming Dexter and Dearly Devoted Dexter - some time ago, and when I heard that there was to be a series based on the books, I was extremely excited. So much so, in fact, that I feared disappointment merely because my standards were so high.

Thankfully, ""Dexter"" absolutely delivers. The show maintains the uncomfortable atmosphere of the novels with better fidelity than one could ever have expected, and Dexter (played by Hall) is all there.

The visual elements from the show are stunning, to say the least. Disturbing, certainly, but more than that - fascinating. Watching the show, it's impossible to keep from finding a certain agreement in oneself for Dexter. He's a monster, and yet it's completely possible to identify with him.

10 out of 10. This one has a permanent spot on my DVR."
Dexter is easily one of my favorite tv shows of all-time and one of the few shows I can watch all the way through several times over without getting bored. It's hard for me to put into words how much I love this show. The only thing that's not good about it is the ending. The ending was pretty bad but that still doesn't take away from how good the show is overall. You should watch this show for Michael C. Hall's performance as Dexter alone. He's amazing in this. If you haven't seen this incredible show yet just make sure you give yourself enough time because you're going to want to binge watch it as fast as you can. Once you start watching you won't be able to stop.
"Absolutely brilliant. True to Jeff Lindsay's books. The visual contrast between the darkness of Dexter's secret life and and the gloss of Miami adds an almost surreal quality. Character development is right on the money, bringing out the background slowly so one can see the development of Dexter's sociopath personality and his confusion of human behavior compared to his own. Dexter is an actor in his own life; his relationships between co-workers and his personal life are well shown in the video media. The fact that he is a blood splatter expert This is a dark work, but set in the bizarre world of life in Miami is almost believable. Developers of this series should also look to Andrew Vachss's books."
"This is going to be my first ever review on IMDb, there is not a day when I do not visit IMDb to check the reviews about movies or TV series that I watch, I watch lots of movies and series.

For the first time in my life it happened to me that I could not sleep after watching a series. I have seen prison break, heroes and a lot other. Prison break and heroes first season was awesome. They inspired me so much that I got some tattoo's done on my body. However both these series cut loose as soon they go to the next season. Heroes was big disappointment but DEXTER.. OMG series after series it starts to make me so curious about the next episode.. damn the season 4. I just could not sleep the whole night after watching it. I spent my weekend watching the episodes back to back.

To start with Dexter (Michael C. Hall) his darkness was off the edge he played the role so well that sometimes I wonder if he is the same in his real life but then I found that Debra Morgan (Jennifer Carpenter) is his real wife who is playing his sister in this series. Damn Debra is one character who is so confused and mostly been controlled by the people around her, she always end up doing something wrong but always gets credit for the good things too.

I love the part when you get to know what is going on in Dexters mind when he thinks about something or when someone is talking to him also the part when he talks to his dead father Harry. (he just thinks what his dad would say in that situation). All the episodes/characters and all the seasons are written and played so well that you can hardly find any flaw in it.

My favorite characters are Dexter (Quite obvious), Rita and Vince Masuka damn Vince is so funny, he just utter one word in his entire episode and comes out to be damn funny.

I just cant wait for the Season 5 and I am sure whosoever watched dexter feels the same way just like I did.

(Apologizes in case my first review has some mistakes and offends somebody's feelings)"
"Dexter, a forensics expert at day, serial killer with a touch of vigilantism at night. Dexter is creating a believable and very detailed portrait of a, lets say troubled, sociopath. One of the parts about the show I like best is the emotions that normal people exhibit, thus forcing Dexter to mimic them. Good laugh when the emotions Dexter fake get real, and he is scared out of his mind, like in the relationship with his ""girlfriend"" Rita, mother of two and victim of her abusive ex-boyfriend. Also liked the acting of Jennifer Carpenter as Dexter's sister Debra, adds a nice touch colour to the show, without drifting into clichés.

Thrilling story, many details, and one of the best opening sequences ever."
"Between Dexter and Weeds, Showtime has a corner on the original new shows market. Not only are both of these shows completely original and innovative, but they are REALLY good.

Dexter, in particular, should not be reviewed by anyone who hasn't seen more than three episodes. I almost feel as if the first episode in the series is a tad-bit melodramatic (note Dexter screaming in the face of his first victim) just to pull in viewers that otherwise need something more visceral than a great screenplay.

By two more episodes the viewer should be absolutely intoxicated by the complexity of the character Dexter and the acting of Michael C. Hall. His own co-stars admit to being almost ""scared"" by how well Hall absorbs his character. Personally, I think that without Hall's mastery of Dexter there would be nothing to watch. Don't get me wrong, the plot of this show is extremely intriguing (and original, to be redundant), but the excitement lies purely in the way Dexter/Hall responds to A) his girlfriend, B) blood, and C) other serial killers.

I think that it is very reasonable to chuckle at Dexter's attempts to ""fit in"" social situations and I believe the writers of this show planned on it. What I am still stuck on, however, is whether or not to cheer Dexter on in his methodology (serial killing serial killers). This had better be the first of many seasons, so spread the word...

...Edit: I watched this series finale last night and come back to this review (which I wrote after the conclusion of Season 1) with my hat in hand to say: ""I'm kind of sorry for the hype.""

If my review was the impetus for your 'Dexter' obsession (I, too, was obsessed) then I owe you an apology for the way it all ended. Sure, sure, I couldn't have known how poorly written the resolution of this once-magnificent series would be. But, you see, I shouted praises for this show from roof-tops...telling every friend who would engage me in discussion about pop-culture that they NEEDED TO WATCH DEXTER, it's the greatest drama on television!

Alas, I will not leave any spoilers here and if you've come along the journey with me then you will undoubtedly watch how it all ends, but I write this edit in vain so that you, internet friend, cannot say that I didn't warn you: 'Dexter' leaves me wanting a real ending."
"Having watched Dexter right to the bitter end I have to say I won't miss it at all. What was a better than average series, stylishly directed with a great cast was forgiven for being a bit repetitive. It should have ended 3 seasons ago, this last season was pathetic, it was as though the writers had been sacked, some new ones brought in and told to keep it ""ticking over"" and told to end it all in the last 2 episodes. for a show built on secrets very few were revealed, this went out with a pathetic whimper. The penultimate series built to a real dramatic high that promised so much for the final series, instead of keeping this up and pushing the characters to new extremes it was as if they were all too tired to be bothered, every character acted as if they were ready for a retirement home."
"In the realm of cinematography and scriptwriting, it is advised to limit character narration allowing actions, conversations, and scenes to speak for themselves. However, if there exists an exception, and it goes by the name, Dexter!

From the start, I found myself captivated by Dexter's character - a dark, introverted individual. The strength of character development was evident, bolstered by impeccable casting and an engaging, crime-filled storyline.

Seasons 1 and 2 stood out exceptionally, earning a commendable rating of 9/10. However, the show's quality began to wane afterward. The introduction of new characters and excessive drama weighed down what was once a classic series. Despite my love for the character, I sensed a gradual decline in its charm, including that of Debra.

The writing and direction were solid, yet Dexter himself stood as the towering centerpiece as his portrayal of dark humor remained a standout aspect. His narration throughout the episodes was a unique perspective where we learnt how he perceived things, people, and crime; it was utterly captivating.

I recommend this series, but I urge viewers to approach it at their own pace and choose the number of seasons to indulge in. However, I must stress that the first two seasons are a must-watch and should not be missed."
"This is undoubtedly, the best ever TV Series I've watched. So addictive, thrilling and entertaining. No boredom, super-fast and it'll glued you to the screen just from the 1st minutes of the 1st episode."
"Over the past couple of years I have gone through some of TV's most followed series of recent years (Breaking Bad, Lost, Fargo, etc.). I've LOVED it: the great storylines, character progression, scenes that make your jaw literally drop. That being said, the TV series Dexter is my favorite, and it's not close. Never have I been so emotionally attached to something on the television. My mind literally correlates memories and relationships made during that time to where I was at in the series at the time. I finished the show in 4 months, and let me tell ya, it was on my mind the entire time, throughout the entirety of the day. I loathed daily responsibilities that took away Dexter's screen time (very unhealthy looking back, not that I could help it). One year after finishing the show, Dexter still crosses mind on a regular basis (one example: me writing this review at nearly 3am in the morning lol). And oh my am I looking forward to the reboot next fall!

One request: please please please do not be turned off by all of the negative reviews about its ""tragic"" ending!! Everyone wanted their own perfect ending (impossible), but what the producers put together is perfectly on brand with the 8-season storyline that precedes it. I have to believe true Dexter fans understand this!"
"Although I am not a regular proponent of serial television shows, the eclectic, in-depth storyline and character development in Dexter are far beyond what I expected from Showtime or any network other than HBO. Dexter is a unique insight into the mind of a serial killer protected by his occupation as well as the lessons derived from his father's teachings. By having a resounding premise of catching a notorious serial killer while trying to conceal his own identity, Dexter enters each week with a new sociological dilemma as well as a new criminal to dispatch. What is best about Dexter is his own personal facade of trying to be normal. While other characters in the show are obviously dysfunctional, the audience are privileged to see the flaws of Dexter while people within his own world cannot. Darkly humorous, well-paced, and morbidly addictive Dexter is the best show of 2006, without a doubt."
New season 2021 confirmed. They say its limited. Let's pray otherwise. I'm so excited!!!
"HBO Actors, HBO Directors, HBO Writers, and Showtime's willingness to take risks that HBO might not see as profitable these days (Carnivale + Deadwood R.I.P.) make for a killer combination in ""Dexter,"" the new Sho Comedy/Drama about a Serial Killer Killing Serial Killer (you read right). In my opinion, Showtime has always had a hard time producing an original series that's truly original and good, so it's incredibly refreshing to see the network pull such a ""Hail Mary"" move and come out on top. ""Dexter"" is, without spoiling anything, an excellent vehicle for Michael C. Hall, and explores the inner monologue of a Serial Killer in a way that has never been approached before without seeming too predictable or hokey. Watch it and you will not be disappointed. You'll even want to watch the next episode, which says a lot considering the network. I just hope they don't screw it up."
"Hard to believe that Showtime would let a piece of gold turn into a turd after four seasons, but they did. Seasons 1-4 are as good as any show I've ever seen, a solid 10, would recommend to anyone and beg them to watch. Holds up wonderfully even in 2021. Seasons 5,6,7 were not good, but had some good moments. Season 8 is as bad as you will find anywhere. Honestly think it was written by sixth graders, I was begging for it to be over - how the actors could put up with the idiocy is beyond me, but I guess they were being paid plenty by then. If you love the first four seasons, watch the next three and enjoy the characters, then read the spoilers to see how season 8 ends. It will truly leave a bad taste in your mouth if you watch the last season."
"Dexter is hilarious; it is easily the best new show on TV! Dark, dry humor crops up in the most unexpected places, and the settings and dialogue are laced with CSI's pseudo-scientific appeal. While the show may appear to treat standard morality as irreverent, it is actually an excellent study of humanity at its best -- and worse.

The character of Dexter, a disassociated, psychopathic serial killer, is somewhat reminiscent of Data, the android in the Star Trek series. Dexter is devoid of normal, human emotion, and has to learn behaviors by rote. Seeing the world through his eyes enables us to closely examine what is ""right"" and what is ""wrong."" We have to pause and wonder about our own perception of reality.

Overall, the show is a side-splitting outlet for the vigilante/serial killer/dysfunctional being in all of us. Well done!"
"What started out to be a phenomenal series, Is not ending well :(. I crack up weekly at everyone's reviews but never got irritated enough to post my own. Well 8yrs later the day has come this is by far the worst season.... OK sure it has a few highs but far more lows. I love Dex but he is turning into a whiny b**** which defeats the purpose of his original purpose. :/ So there's my rant I wont even get into the others or else I might as well right a report.Wtf is this 10 line crap I see one liners all the time????So they want us to write a whole report. Well this is my 1st review which is obvious at this point lol.So you want 10 lines here is your 10 lines."
"The first Season of Dexter was quite brilliant, i immediately fell in love with the character. and the idea of this serial Killer that hunts down other Killers without leaving a trace fascinated me! The second Season started off good too, but at the end of this Season Dexter should have been caught by the Police/FBI for all the mistakes he made and traces he left. This is where Dexter died for me. But because of its success in the beginning the saga of dexter continued and there came another aspect into the series, the commercialization. Suddenly the relations of the characters became ever more important, just as in any other sitcom and Dexter's kills ever more sloppier. His mistakes mainly kept the story alive and it became really easy to foresee the main plots of Dexter's story because what ever he could do wrong he did. The original Dexter acting according to his codex/logics was gone. What started off so great ended in a mediocre series. This series suffered the tragedy of being brought to the masses."
"Everyone knows that the last few seasons of The Walking Dead weren't the same quality as the earlier ones, those early seasons were groundbreaking in so many ways that this series is considered among the best ever. Because of that this show still gets a high rating from me. Like most long running shows, it had its ups and downs but even at its worst it was still the #1 show on cable, in fact it has been #1 every season it's been on the air. The last few seasons without Andrew Lincoln (Rick Grimes) haven't been as good but it at least started to get back to being a pretty good show during this last season. Norman Reedus (Daryl) and Jeffery Dean Morgan (Negan) continued to carry the show after Andrew Lincoln's departure to the point where people looked forward to it again. Having said all that, it was still probably time for it to end."
"I just watched all seasons of this show. This is a pretty well crafted piece of t.v. To be honest, if your a horror fan; this is pretty much: a masterpiece dream come true. (Gem).

Pros: The show is good at changing topic season to season: good amount of likable characters, has good character conflict. The show explores several genres: Drama, melo-drama, action, romance, civil war, human connection, friendship, horror, birth, child-loss, survival, family, love that touches the heart, and much more. The characters are put into some interesting situations: very creative scene design. Good main character casting, very entertaining. Solid character growth. Soulful dialogue, and Good acting from the main cast. 👍

Cons: Some of the costume designs are basic. Basic scene music. Production is good, but could have been a little bit stronger. Some dramatic scenes drag longer than needed. Scene editing shakey at times.

Overall: To be honest this is a grate show. Good t.v reflection of human survival. Anyone who knows anything about t.v or film could not rate this no lower than an 8 out of 10. It can be scary and gory at times: but it's called the walking dead for a reason. First 3 seasons are excellent. Im guessing their the best ones to be honest. 5,6,7, and 8 are grate too. However the Negan saga had some of the better acting. Final rating: 8.2 out of 10."
"The Walking Dead is a genre-defining series that captivates audiences with its gritty storytelling, compelling characters, and unflinching exploration of survival in a world devastated by the undead. Based on Robert Kirkman's acclaimed comic book series, this post-apocalyptic drama transcends the typical zombie narrative, delving into the complexities of human nature and the bonds forged amid chaos.

The early seasons are particularly impactful, with Andrew Lincoln delivering a commanding performance as Rick Grimes, whose leadership and moral dilemmas form the emotional core of the series. The ensemble cast, including Norman Reedus as the resourceful Daryl Dixon and Melissa McBride as the resilient Carol Peletier, adds depth and nuance to a diverse group of survivors. The evolution of these characters is handled with care, making their journeys resonate long after each episode.

One of the series' greatest strengths lies in its ability to balance intense action with raw, emotional storytelling. It masterfully explores themes of loss, hope, and the fragile line between humanity and savagery. From the terror of a walker herd to the unpredictable dangers posed by other survivors, the show maintains a constant tension that keeps viewers engaged. The blend of horror and drama is seamless, creating a world where every decision carries weight and consequences.

However, The Walking Dead is not without its flaws. Pacing issues and extended plotlines, particularly in later seasons, can hinder the narrative's momentum. Some characters experience inconsistent development, and the show's ambitious scope occasionally results in uneven storytelling. Despite these imperfections, the series remains compelling, with powerful moments, shocking twists, and deep character arcs that continue to captivate its audience.

Having rewatched the series multiple times, it's clear that its impact and storytelling have solidified its place as one of the most significant television shows of its genre. The raw depiction of survival, resilience, and the human condition keeps drawing viewers back, offering new layers of appreciation with each revisit.

In conclusion, The Walking Dead stands as a landmark in the zombie genre, redefined by its focus on character-driven drama and moral complexity. While not without its imperfections, the series earns its legacy through its gripping stories, unforgettable characters, and emotional intensity. It remains a captivating watch, offering enduring appeal for both dedicated fans and new audiences alike."
I think The Walking Dead is the best show to come out in our generation. I also think if they make a comic book replica remake of the show and use most of the same actors and fit Daryl in there because of The Walking Dead survival instinct(Xbox and steam) story Because Daryl's our guy. It would be way higher rated way more lore filling better ratings for sure and I feel like people would love it 20x more bc I feel like some people feel like they Ben cheated ik Carl has and some characters we will never meet and story we will never see it's just so much possibility's and story that could be on the big screen. Thank you.
"I'm still a little young you know (lol) and I didn't know the old zombie classics of the genre as the illustrious George A. Romero did it but this modern-day classic is a must in the style. No SF, just humanity in decline fighting for its survival through hordes and hordes of ''Walker''. Even if it took me several years to watch it completely due to a lack of motivation, it's still a real thrill to find myself in my living room with all this gang with whom we really get attached. I'm currently listening to ''Fear of the Walking Dead'' and I plan to listen to the subsequent series of the genre that have come out <3."
"The Walking Dead series captures the intensity and unpredictability of a post-apocalyptic world in a way that few shows have matched. With its unforgettable characters, relentless action, and deep psychological tension, it goes beyond the classic zombie genre. The show begins by introducing Rick Grimes, a sheriff who wakes up in a world devastated by a mysterious virus, and we follow his journey as he gathers a group of survivors, each bringing their own strengths, flaws, and stories.

One of the series' strongest points is its character development. We see how the struggle for survival in a world filled with walkers (zombies) and often-hostile human groups brings out both the best and worst in people. Characters like Daryl, Michonne, and Carol evolve tremendously, each dealing with losses, moral compromises, and moments of hope. The human conflicts often become as intense and captivating as the battle against the undead.

Another aspect that stands out is the show's commitment to atmosphere and world-building. The makeup and effects on the walkers are visually impressive, and the show builds tension through eerie, abandoned settings. The creators don't shy away from showing the physical and emotional toll of this harsh new world, making viewers feel as though they are right alongside the survivors.

However, The Walking Dead does have some slower seasons, where character arcs may drag and certain storylines feel a bit stretched. Yet even in those slower moments, the series consistently pulls viewers back with its emotional depth and the strong bonds formed among the characters. It ultimately isn't just about zombies-it's about survival, community, and the lengths people will go to protect their loved ones.

In summary, The Walking Dead is a gripping exploration of survival and humanity, set against the backdrop of a world overrun by walkers. For those who enjoy stories of resilience and complex characters, this series is a must-watch."
"People can say what they like about The Walking Dead, yes I've watched other shows, and yes I'm aware of The Walking Dead's Falloff. Which is why I'm only focusing on the first 8 Seasons. Those 8 Seasons, well, let me tell you, they were phenomenal. Now let me get it out of the way, yes The Walking Dead is not the best TV Show, I know that, and I also don't think so. But it doesn't change the fact it's my favourite. An amazing cast of characters and Top Notch Acting.

The only thing I'm really sad, or disappointed about is why on earth this show is still going. So I will say that. The Later Seasons (S9-S11) are actually good seasons, it's just that they're completely unnecessary and the show should've long ago at S8."
"Really loved this programming, especially Rick. It is a shame that COVID seemed to have slowed Andrew Lincoln down as he was seemingly bound for big things before hand. The first couple seasons were brilliant, for me it was the Negan effect that really hurt the show, especially making it out as if Rik would fear him which was laughable. Rick delt with the Governor, he won't fear someone like Negan who was essentially a coward. I especially did not enjoy the six year jump as it did not make sense as to why Daryl would still be looking after so long when they would have come to terms with it by now. The finale was probably the poorest episode in the entire show."
"I've been a fan of The Walking Dead ever since the first episode of the first season. Even though the quality has gone down in recent years I still haven't missed an episode. While the last few seasons weren't quite as good they were still worth watching. It did go out on a high note though, the last season was actually pretty good. It had a few slow filler episodes but overall it was solid. Even though it was definitely time for it to end I'm still going to miss it. When something's been apart of your life for so long it's hard to say goodbye. The good news for fans is that there are a few spinoffs coming in 2023. I'm actually interested in the spinoffs considering they all star my favorite characters from the main show. There's three of them so far...one with Rick & Michonne, one with Negan & Maggie and one with Darryl going over to Europe. Again, those all happen to be my favorite characters so I'm looking forward to them and hope they're good!"
"The first 4 seasons were genuinely great! Mostly interesting characters with depth and good archs. Season 5 was okay but became a bit messy. Following seasons became a who' who of human stockpiles. Way too many characters, descisions that made no sense, blurry storylines and no character development.

Entering season 11 and I truly have no idea who most of these people are anymore, what they're doing and why."
"This is a very long running TV-show (10+ years) with many seasons. One common view is that the first seasons are great, then it becomes garbage. I decided to binge-watch in 2021 to make an opinion for myself.

What I will say is that season 1 is definitely the fastest paced season, reminiscent of typical Zombie films such as Dawn of the Dead with a simple ""escape the undead"" premise. After season 1, the pacing becomes very slow (lots of episodes, each 1 hour), and the story drags on and is more about watching the cast settle down in bases/single locations. It becomes a post-apoc survival show.

Personally, I very much enjoyed binge watching this entire show. I even prefered the later seasons than the first seasons. It felt enjoyable to watch a slower paced story of survival and base/world building by the core cast of the show, mainly Rick Grimes and his son Carl. The reason is that ""escaping the zombies"" and being stressed & running all the time, gets old. I liked the other aspects of post-apocalypse survival themes such as the danger of other human groups (Negan and the saviors, I really liked, the Negan actor is amazing and very charismatic).

One of the common views I read online is that the entire show is amazing if binge watched, as it forms one great story. However it was HELL for the people that watched a single episode per week/month, because often very little happens in each episode, dragging the seasons on forever. But binge watching a season makes for a nice ""kick back & relax"" TV show to enjoy.

So in conclusion, I would very much ignore the reviews that say ""Only season 1 is great"" and ""anything after season 5 sucks"". I would advise you binge watch from season 1, and stop when you no longer want to watch. For me, I just couldn't stop and really started to enjoy the show from season 6 onwards (when the ""running from zombies"" premise ends).

Overall, no matter one's opinion, one undeniable fact is that this is the QUINTESSENTIAL zombie TV show, with the number of seasons to match. It is simply epic and I cannot wait to see how season 11 concludes this story. Enjoyable through the dead. Just Watch it."
"Have been true fan from beginning, still am, love the show and the characters, BUT.....

the taking on of other people, while realistic, is a bit much and they barely fight again the Walkers anymore. This is sad as the fear, desperation and horror of struggling to survive in a world now ruled by Walking Dead, is how it all started.

So this is a sincere request to the leaders, the writers and producers, get back to fighting and surviving against the Walkers/Zombies!! Please!!!"
"I loved the first few seasons, but around the time that Negan came, it went downhill. The main thing I liked about the show was the emphasis on humans vs walkers. But now it's mainly humans vs humans. I feel like the show got sidetracked, and there are so many unexplored avenues. e.g. I would be interested to see if they could connect with people overseas. If they can build things up again and create new towns etc. And gradually restore humanity etc."
"Had heard nothing but great things about 'The Walking Dead' from friends and IMDb reviewers. It took a while to get round to walking, both from being busy and also not being sure whether it would be my cup of tea.

Finally getting round to it a few years ago and slowly working my way through it, 'The Walking Dead' turned out to be very much my cup of tea and as good as the hype made it out to be. Seasons 1-5 of 'The Walking Dead' to me were absolutely brilliant, and it still shocks me at how an intelligent, well-made (so much so that it is easy to mistake it for a film) show about zombies could be made when so many films have tried and failed abysmally to do so. My only complaint about the early seasons actually is the slightly slow start to Season 2.

'The Walking Dead' is incredibly well made in the production values, with gritty and audacious production design, photography of almost cinematic quality, effects that look good, have soul and are not overused or abused and pretty frightening make-up which helps make the already freaky zombies even freakier. The music is haunting and affecting, having presence but never being too intrusive.

For five seasons, the writing was intelligent and thought-provoking, with lots of tension and emotional resonance and improving every time a story and character were expanded and given more complexity. Loved that the stories had multiple layers and felt satisfactorily resolved, while the action is both thrilling and terrifying, the blood-spattering gore uncompromising.

Seasons 3 and 4 are especially good in this regard, and it is the latter where the complexities and nuance of the storytelling and characterisation particularly shine. The pace was a little slow to begin with in Season 2 but thrilling elsewhere while not rushing through important pieces of information. Direction is smart and atmospheric while the show throughout has been strongly acted especially from the two leads playing particularly well-crafted characters.

Which is why it is so sad that Season 7 has been a dead mess on the whole, apart from the production values, some effective world-building and the actors did their best with what they had (an achievement somewhat, admiration is to be had for anybody able to do anything with such poor material). Season 6 did have some slow and pointless moments and the finale was a disappointment but had good things. Can say very little good about Season 7 though.

A season where once interesting, complex characters are no more. Negan was a fascinating villain, now a cartoonish caricature that one wants done away with, don't blame Jeffrey Dean Morgan here, he's great in the role, it's the writing. Pacing has been all over the map, often brutally slow. The season has had too many characters and subplots that are mostly under-explored or completely superfluous. There was heavy reliance on over-convenience, lots of melodrama, very talky sections that add little and feel like padding, little character growth, frustratingly illogical decision making and some convolution. And there were very few thrills or scares thanks to lack of suspense and a sense that everything feels toned down.

Overall, brilliant for about just over two-thirds but Season 7 was a serious disappointment and has left me dubious as to whether to stick with the show for the eighth season. With such a decline lately, there is a sense that a once addictive personal favourite show has run its course. 7.5/10 Bethany Cox"
"The walking dead was amazing until season 6. Ones they reach that fenced village and the whole story with negan begins, it becomes very boring and reptetive. The zombies are no threat anymore and the feeling of Urgency is lost. The feeling of danger is lost. I have watched until season 9 and it got worse with every season since season 6. So sad that it had to come to this. They should never have found that fenced city..."
Was the best thing on TV at one point! Couldn't wait for it to be on! Was so engaging and all the character threads were amazing! Now they are all getting on my nerves! Is it wrong to want them all to be turned into zombies? I now watch this on a tablet in the background while watching something else. Want to finish it but not really bothered what happens to them! Has been dragged out for far too long now.
"Series 7&8 were tough, in fact we gave up hope completely and stopped watching. Recently we gave it another go and got through it and series 9 is not disappointing us so far. TWD is back to how it used to be Humans vs zombies with some added dangers! There have been highs and lows but it keeps you hooked. I hope they continue like this."
"Ive watched this show 3 times and all the spinoffs, its the best show to exist that ive seen and my favourite.

Every season is amazing, most people only disagree because they are blinded by nostalgia of the beginning characters who died

please watch this show like i cannot begin to describe how amazing it its literally my whole personality

the acting is amazing, the writing, the ideas, characters/ development, its just so good

dont listen to the other bs comments please just watch

i can also assure u that even if horror isnt ur favourite genre u would still love this show honestly theres like everything in it."
"The Walking Dead in its first season could not be touched. When it came down to it, the first season had a collection of complex characters, thought provoking dialogue, captivating storylines, great cinematography, and downright scary looking zombies. Its hard to pin-point one thing that is extraordinary about Season 1 since there are so many aspects to talk about. First off, the scenes in downtown Atlanta were incredibly visual and the scenes that took place in more rural areas were very scenic. The undead in the first season had great makeup and special effects too, the zombies had defined faces that really make them feel they were once human. If I had to pick one thing that was great about the first season, its has to be the cast... Andrew Lincoln and Jon Bernthal make great, bad ass lead actors that also have the ability to project a range of emotions. Laurie Holden is also radiant in this season and the surrounding cast of Jeffrey DeMunn, Steven Yeun, Irone Singleton, and Norman Reedus all showcase a great character that can be easily become a fan-favorite to any. Frank Darabont hit a grand slam with the Walking Dead and its fairly easily to see why the shows popularity boomed right away."
"The Walking Dead"" is arguably the best show to date, brilliantly blending horror, drama, and deep moral dilemmas. Among its standout characters is Daryl Dixon, portrayed by Norman Reedus. Initially a rough, solitary hunter, Daryl evolves into a loyal and compassionate leader, embodying themes of redemption and belonging. His exceptional skills and emotional depth, particularly in his relationships with characters like Carol and Rick, resonate profoundly with viewers. Set in a post-apocalyptic world, the series explores survival and humanity through unforgettable storytelling, making ""The Walking Dead"" a must-watch for fans of gripping narratives."
"On the surface, this show seemed goofy and fun. But then a few episodes in, once I had my guard down, I suddenly realized what a beautiful thing the show's creators are trying to accomplish here. And I was nearly in tears. Almost like whenever I'm under the weather and a sentimental commercial makes me want to start bawling, except in a more inspired way.

Ted Lasso is exactly what we needed, exactly when we needed him. Easily one of the best new series I've seen in a long while.

This is what comedy should be. This.

10/10"
"I started this with low expectations: An American series, written by Americans about football (soccer).

However, I have to apologise: it is hilarious AND heartening - mixing American and English humour perfectly.

I laughed out loud in every episode and my eyes leaked in a few as well.

Brilliant"
"With all the negative politics and societal vitriol we face in the media and our daily lives, coach Ted Lasso is a welcome respite of kindness and goodwill. It's exactly what we need right now. Naively optimistic, he's a better man than most with a positive energy that we can all benefit from. Watch it with no expectations, highly rewarding."
"The premise is almost maddeningly stupid and cliche, but the performances, tone, and writing are so pitch perfect (yes, I know) that this one appears to be a resounding win. Sudeikis is so inoffensively handsome and manly, when he slaps on Ted Lasso's indefatigable smile and positive outlook he has even the viewer, who knows this is a complete work of fiction, believing in him. Hannah Waddingham's Rebecca smoulders in every scene, an absolute smoke show so hot it nearly hurts the eyes to look at her though you could not pay me to look away. With an interesting gallery of supporting acts orbiting Ted, he shines brilliantly and draws them all in, albeit quite reluctantly. I was one of the cold hearts Ted Lasso won over: his charm and love for the most simple joys (including wordplay) make his presence irresistible. The first three episodes serve as the most deft first touch, I wait with bated breath to see the spectacular finish."
The highlight of my week. Everything about this should not work but it is perfectly brilliant in the way it charms. This is how TV should be!
"Ted Lasso is set as a comedy, but turns out to be a very lovely and warm hearted comedy drama (in the most positive way possible). The characters are very well written and are represented by fine actors who fits perfect. The story is also well written and mile stones are set perfectly. It's a feel good series and I think it's hard not to like after you get into it. I love it and can't get enough of it."
Ted Lasso starts off with this bumbling fool as a new manager of an English Soccer team. Then the shows grows by introducing so many great characters with so much heart. I love the interplay between so many of the characters. The casting team is amazing -- great actors!
"At first look, this series looks like it will be almost impossibly stupid and cliché ridden: the American rube and the heartless dowager (but impossibly hot!) butt heads over the soul of an ailing football club. You soon bear witness to the fact that the only thing this has in common with other coach-team fairy tales is that they lose games and then start winning. But as Ted Lasso points out repeatedly in his home-spun wisdom, the games they play on the grass don't mean a fraction compared to the lives of the people affected.

If ever people needed a heart-warming and life-affirming (yes, I said life-affirming, and I don't even know what that means) story, it would be in 2020. Ted Lasso doesn't have a cynical or sarcastic bone in his body, and viewers will very quickly be won over to his way of playing and living.

I could have done without any of the jokes about how little he knows about football. Not many of them were funny and some were just annoying. Thankfully, these were few and evaporated quickly as the story got up on its own two legs and ran away from the original TV commercial gag.

I just watched E07 last night and I couldn't even believe how badly I needed what Ted Lasso is selling. After a tough day reading the news, the show went down like good medicine. I've never had that experience from watching a TV show before. Can we have more, please? I hope this starts a trend towards this type of programming.

Don't get me wrong, I love gangster movies and crime stories, but there are so very few stories out there telling us that we really need to treat each other better. I see movie posters on bus stops and almost every one of them has some guy-or guys-with a gun-or guns. There should be a law against peddling this trash in public. You can't have a porno movie poster at a bus stop, yet almost everyone has sex which is a perfectly normal part of life, so why should movies selling violence have such free reign over our public spaces?"
"At a time when the world is on fire (in some areas literally), and as a planet we are all depressed, anxious, and uncertain about our future, the timing couldn't be more perfect for this positive and upbeat show to be airing. Not only does the determined lead make those around him happier, he does it by determinedly being helpful and warm with every homespun bit of wisdom he dispenses. It doesn't hurt that he quickly attracts the other sincere individuals that populate the pocket universe of this football club into his circle, to quickly form a strange yet wonderful work/team follower family. For the first time in quite a while I find myself looking forward to the weekly episodes, and with each one I watch I end the episode with a smile on my face."
"Ted Lasso not only lives up to all the hype but exceeds it. I absolutely loved this show! I liked it so much that I'll probably watch both seasons again before season 3 comes out, that's how good this show is! Jason Sudeikis is absolutely fantastic as Ted Lasso. He deserves every award he's won for this role. The entire cast is incredible for that matter. I'm glad to see all the love this show gets and all the awards it's been winning. It's much deserved. If you haven't seen this amazing show yet then do yourself a favor and go watch as soon as possible. Just leave yourself enough time because you're going to want to binge it as quickly as you can."
"Glad Jason Sudikis won golden globe recently for his role, well deserved! The humor is superb quite delightful throughout. I appreciate the sport aspect to it more than most of the genre and I'm not much a fan of sports! Juno Temple is gorgeous as well even more so than when she was younger. The creator really made a wonderful entertaining series that deserves any praise Ted Lasso receives."
"Far more interesting and more deep than you'd; expect from a modern comedy. You kind of expect an office-type comedy where everyone is a caricature whose existence is just a single facet of the group as a whole... the scheming boss, the angry old athlete, the American out of his element, etc... immediately, they start breaking down these stereotypes and each and every main character starts developing depth, pathos, honesty, reasoning for their actions and often reflection of what they've done...they grow and develop, which is a rarity for a comedy these days. And it's hysterically funny, And it's completely engrossing.

""Ted Lasso"" is really, REALLY good..easily one of the best shows of the season no matter the service. Looking forward to the next episode!"
"To be honest when I saw the previews of this show with Sudeikis running around looking like someone from a playground wanted poster acting like a caricature of an overly positive American that I'm not sure even totally exists I thought wow AppleTV is really bad haha, especially after some of their other major swing & miss attempts. Then I saw the 8.7 rating on here and thought wow they also spent A LOT of cash to artificially raise the score. Disgusting...

But then I watched the first episode, even though I thought the ratings were BS I figured it was worth a shot since I'm a fan of Sudeikis generally, and I have to admit I was wrong. This is one of the freshest shows I've seen in a long time, which is strange because it uses the same old tropes in a lot of ways but I guess it's a combo of the characters and slightly new twists on the old formulas that make it work. It's somehow chesey & nostalgic but only in a positive way. For a somewhat broad comedy the acting is top-notch too, which makes sense if you look at the actors involved backgrounds but still, not what I would expect in a show like this, and I believe that is the other factor that sets this show apart from others like it. I never thought I would say this, but I highly recommend this show, and can't wait to see the next episode! PS - I came in late, as the 1st season is almost over (it's been renewed for a 2nd already) and I would say even though Apple releases 1 per week, it's best if you can save up and watch them all at once, since it's a relatively light show imo it's best enjoyed that way."
"My family and friends LOVED season 1 & 2 and were eagerly anticipating season 3...what a HUGE disappointment the first six episodes of season 3 has been. Our only hope is that the second half of the season will return to the greatness of season 1 & 2. So far it is a classic writing failure and a mystery over why they abandoned the successful formula and arcs of the first two seasons. This will go down in history with other fantastic failures after a great start such as Gilmore Girls and Last Man standing. What was Jason Sudekis thinking when he approved this script, ""How quickly can I kill this show??"""
"Ted Lasso has been one of the most talked about shows of 2020-21 and is on every ""best shows of 2020-21"" list that I've seen so I thought I'd finally give it a chance. Once I started it I couldn't stop and binged the entire season in just a few days. I can't say enough about Jason Sudeikis as Ted Lasso...he was just flat out great! This show really is every bit as good as everyone says it is and more!"
"I heard so many raves about Ted Lasso that even after watching the first, middling episode, I kept going. I'm so glad I did. The show is hilarious and heartwarming in a non-syrupy way. The characters are fun and distinct, and the series manages to hit all sorts of serious topics in a way that respects the seriousness but doesn't bury you in it.

As with Schitt's Creek, you would never guess how good this series is from the pilot. Watch at least 3 episodes. You'll be glad you did."
"I watched the 1st, 2nd and 3rd episodes and I can't wait for the next seven to air. Jason is a true actor/comedian and plays Ted Lasso perfectly. I first expected a Will Farrel type bumbling fool and then realized Ted Lasso is a man of heart and soul, an inspiration to those in despair, a man that brushes off stupidity and keeps everyone around him uplifted with his "" Let's go team "" approach. The supporting cast fits right in to make the show enjoyable. I personally don't care for soccer but I enjoy the athleticism and skill it takes to succeed. All I want to really say is watch the show and you'll agree it is enjoyable and a breath of fresh air ."
"OMG, I wasn't expecting the show to be so good. am a big fan of football, so initially I was expecting to cringe all through but ended up laughing my ass away. 3 episodes so far and am already sold, I hope they keep the momentum going cos this show is gold"
"Jason sudeikis Jason is the soul of this show and the best reason to watch it. I couldn't believe how funny it was at first until I kept watching and found myself laughing in a very crazy way, other than the great drama and good acting from the whole crew, but Jason is the best. Jason is currently one of my favorites and this series is one of my favorites right now. We want more from Jason Sudakis who might be the funniest person in this field at the moment"
"Let me state upfront that I am a latecomer to the Ted Lasso party. Yes, I had heard it was good, every good, indeed very very good, and if I had wanted to, I could've swung it: if need be, just get an Apple TV free trial for 7 days and binge-watch the whole thing in those 7 days, which is in fact easily done. Yet somehow I just didn't feel the need to do it.

I am happy to report that I finally gave in, and started streaming Apple TV. One of the first things I checked out was of course Ted Lasso. I am now caught up on the initial 2 seasons, and I am blown away by how good this show really is. The starting premise is as silly as it is brilliant: after a nasty divorce, the ex of the prior owner of the (fictional) English Premier League soccer club AFC Richmond inherits the club. In order to inflict as much pain on her ex, the new owner decides to ""burn the club to the ground"", and what better way to do this by hiring an utterly unqualified American football coach with zero soccer experience. What could go wrong? Season 1 (10 episodes of about 30 min each) is one of the best TV seasons that I've seen in my lifetime, period. My favorite episode is episode 7, where the team travels to Liverpool to take on Everton. Do you need to like soccer in order to appreciate Ted Lasso? No, you do not, but it certainly doesn't hurt if you do love soccer! I happen to be a die-hard soccer fan (I grew up in Belgium), and the entire Season 1 just felt perfect. Jason Sudeikis in the title role is playing a career-defining role, and the many accolades that he has won for this are thoroughly deserved, but in reality much of the characters are perfectly cast: Hannah Waddingham (as Rebecca, the new owner), Brett Goldstein (as the team's veteran captain), and Juno Temple (as the team's marketing director) are just a few of them. Season 2 (12 episodes ranging from 30 to 45 min each) is quite good as well, but of course lacks the element of surprise of Season 1, but it makes for very entertaining viewing. The series is billed as a comedy, and yes, there are funny moments sprinkled throughout, but Ted Lasso is so much more than that: it is pointed but never nasty, it is wistful but never sentimental. It's a good-feel series.

Season 3 (also the series' last season) is scheduled to be released this coming Spring on Apple TV, and I for one can't wait to check it out. If you enjoyed Ted Lasso, I would also suggest you check out ""Welcome to Wrexham"", the documentary mini-series about a lower tied Welsh football team that is acquired by Ryan Reynold and Rob McElhenney with a view of getting the team to promote to the next level up. Of course the big difference is that this series follows real life events, whereas Ted Lasso is fictional and with tongue firmly in cheek. Enjoy!"
Just go for it. Ted Lasso is a full of energy. Its a real delight when Mr. Sudeikis comes on screen. I don't understand why Mr. Sudeikis is so underrated. Saying it again Just go for it. No one will be disappointed I betcha all.
"I love this show so much. It's silly, extremely well written, and truly feel-good. It's nice to have a show out there where the characters are just being true to themselves, and there isn't a whole lot of unnecessary drama. It's also so refreshing to see a show where women are good to each other, and they aren't catty for no good reason like so many shows out there.

Basically, this is a show I could watch over and over and over again because it is just that lovely and sooo freakin funny!"
"Okay, so I really loved the first two seasons of Ted, and couldn't wait for season 3's first episode, since season 2 ended with a bit of a cliffhanger with Nate. But so far, I hate to say, season 3 is a bit of a disappointment. The writing seems off, not nearly as funny as before. I noticed it's a completely new set of staff writers, so perhaps that's the problem. At any rate, it's not nearly as funny, the dialogue feels stiff, and it hasn't resolved things that should have already been resolved from last season. Such a let-down from such a great show. I hope the coming episodes have more to offer."
"Season one was one of the best shows I've ever seen. While it was cheesy, it was heart warming, witty, and refreshing. I binged the entire season in two days and then I watched it again. The development of the main characters left a lot of room for growth in future story lines and I was excited to see what was next.

Season two was pretty good. It lost a bit of season one's sparkle but I loved Keeley and Roy, and I loved Ted's positive outlook on life that continued to make an impact on the team.

And then there was season three. All I can say is what happened?! Between the new, pointless characters, the demise of Keeley, and the team suddenly forgetting how to play their sport, it's become unbearable to watch. Ted is a depressing mess and there is no appeal to watching him. Rebecca and Keeley had a wonderful, supportive relationship which we barely even see. Keeley has turned into an insecure, weak character. Between the never ending virtue signaling and the checking off of diversity boxes for diversity sake, this show has lost itself and the reason people loved it in the first place. The only redeeming quality of this season is the growth of Jamie and his friendship with Roy. That alone is why I've choked through this season. At first I was sad to see it go, but now I think it's for the best. Please do not make a season 4. I cannot imagine another season of what this show has turned into."
"After a good season 1 and decent season 2, the show has completely lost its way in Season 3. Terrible writing, must be new writers. Every character is a mindless, slapstick, uninteresting caricature of their previous selves. It's shocking how fast this show went downhill.

I'm compelled to keep watching to see how bad it can get. It's hit rock bottom but I want to see if it can somehow get worse.

Season 1 was fun, interesting with good character development. It makes you like almost every character and root for them. 7/10.






Such a disappointment."
"The Handmaid's Tale is a lot better than I expected it to be. It has a 8.4 rating for a reason. As good as the show is there are a few problems with it. The biggest problem with it is it's gone on for to long. It probably should have ended a season or two ago. I'm glad they're finally ending it next season, hopefully it will have a decent ending. Also, even though the story is very interesting, it can get pretty slow at times. There are filler episodes that doesn't move the story forward at all. And the last negative is there far too many close ups of Elizabeth Moss' face. It feels like there's 10-15 per episode and it actually starts to get distracting. Having said all that, I still really enjoy this show. I usually wait until all the episodes are released and then binge the entire season over a weekend."
"The Handmaid's Tale is one of the most infuriating, depressing, and most difficult to watch shows I've ever seen. You keep waiting for things to turn into June's favor or all the terrible people in the show to get what they have coming to them but it just never happens. It just keeps getting more and more depressing and hopeless! There are little victories along the way but it takes until the end of Season 4 before you finally get some satisfaction. Having said all that it's still an incredible show that is so well acted and written that it is always nominated for all the major awards. June is a character the changes so much throughout the show. She's almost unlikable by the time season 3 & 4 arrive. There is no doubt that some of the show is excruciatingly slow but it's worth it to stick with it. It's probably time for the show to come to an end soon and I hope it has a satisfying ending."
"I've just finished (binge) watching season 4. From the start, the story of a dystopian future in ""North America"", plagued by religious zealots with sadistic personality disorder is gut wrenchingly hard to watch, yet the viewer can't help but continue. The heroes (mostly females) refuse to be broken in spirit, forming alliances to fight the evil system, never abandoning hope for victory.

My reason for withholding the 10th star for a perfect rating is a clear contradiction no one seems to be addressing at all: The ""necessity"" for this whole ""child bearing machine"" is a declining birth rate, yet people are executed for the most ridiculous infractions. If children are scarce and precious things, why are adults so expendable? It seems that for each new child born, 10 adults are ""hanged on the wall"" like wet clothing on a line to dry. How (in God's Name) does THAT help stave off the fear of a shrinking population?"
"If I may start 'off-topic' for a moment. I am male, mid sixties, and have watched, like many others, all the great (and not-so-great) horror films. After watching the ten episodes of 'The Handmaid's Tale' I can safely say that THIS is a real horror story. It makes the entire horror genre seem like cotton candy. After each episode I find myself shaking, often with tears in my eyes. I'm not going to talk about the story. I am going to tell you that the acting is beyond reproach. In almost every movie, every TV series, there are at least one or two characters that don't fit or are poorly portrayed. Not so here. I simply cannot find fault with the performances of the entire cast. Stellar! The sets, the direction, the camera work, the intensity all fit together seamlessly. This is a story of a good world...gone very wrong. This is a story about faith, twisted by evil intent, then thrust upon the common people. For me it is truly horrifying. I'm sorry I can't find better words to describe how this show affects me. I will say this: My daughter is currently attending university in the U.S. and I can tell you I fear for her safety every hour of every day. Not because this story is happening now...but because it is so close."
"I jumped onto The Handmaids bandwagon pretty late; I started the series a couple of weeks ago & just finished with seasin 4. I chose to disregard the plethora of negative reviews about the last 2 seasons because I wanted to make my own conclusions about the show, as a whole. While many of the negative reviews do make valid points, such as some of the scenes being too slow & the (way) too many unnecessary close-ups of June, I thought the overall show was excellent!!

As an individual who: 1- raised in an extremely strict, religious setting 2- a victim of sexual abuse for many years 3- trapped in very tightly controlled & highly abusive relationships & 4-had a child ripped from my arm because I was deemed ""unworthy"" of being a mother simply because the grandparents were more financially stable at the time, this show truly resonated with SO MUCH of what I've gone & been through & what I've overcome & recovered from...hence the title of my review.

I understand that my review doesn't give much in reference to the show, itself, but it is a testament not only to those of us who've endured similar circumstances, but a testament to what strongly held beliefs, such as religion can do & the impact it can have on those who do not have those same beliefs.

It is OKAY to have differences of opinions. It is OKAY to have different beliefs. It is OKAY to be who we are, as individuals, but it is NOT okay to be persecuted for those differences. We do not all have to or need to agree with one another, but we all MUST learn to respect one another & accept people for who they are."
"I've never written a review in my life. After seeing this and then looking for more information about it, I came across IMDb and instead of finding intelligent reviews from intelligent people, I find a few that scream of ignorance.

It is pretty easy to understand why.

As the 20th century began, human evolution was at a turning point. Science fiction of the day predicted a future that was more enlightened, civilized and more intelligent. But as time went on, things seemed to be heading in the opposite direction. A dumbing down of society began to occur. How did this happen? Natural selection, the process by which the strongest, the smartest, the fastest, reproduced in greater numbers than the rest and in which the weakest or not-so-intelligent were culled, a process which had once favored the noblest traits of man, now began to favor different traits. Evolution began not to reward intelligence, but to coddle and save the weakest. With no natural predators to thin the herd, it began to simply reward those who reproduced the most, and left ""Intelligent Man and Woman"" to become an endangered species. One need not look far within these comments to see that in effect. It's not that hate which is shown in some of these reviews that is killing the world. I think that up to a certain point all of us possess some level of hate. It is not having the mental acuity or aptitude to recognize it within ourselves, and to not let ourselves be led by it. Some of these so-called reviews are downright scary when you stop to think that is the actual mentality of the person who wrote them. One guy decrying interracial couples and gays to the point of not watching a television program that has them. A woman who says this could not happen and in the next paragraph goes on to detail how it could happen, only not as Christianity. Who cares what it is called, if you admit it could happen?

As for this series itself, it is relevant. For now. In this time. More than ever.

Beyond that, it is beautifully filmed and acted.

Do not fall for the negative reviews of those fanatics and zealots who are purposefully trying to bring down the ratings and who are so lost they cannot even practice the very laws of a god they are trying to defend.

This series is a masterpiece."
"They have an interesting story but it happens in super-slow motion. They have about 2 seasons worth of storyline but they are trying to stretch it into 6-7 seasons by spending half of each episode zooming into people's eyes, showing people's empty faces and characters moving at slow motion. Each episode has about 4-5 minutes of story development and 40 minutes of zooming into people's faces and eyes.

This show was meant to be watched at 2x or 3x speed. If you are watching it at regular speed, you are actually watching it in slow motion.

Each episode: zoom into someone's face, zoom into someone's eyes, zoom on the ceiling, zoom on the walls, zoom back into someone's eyes, zoom into another character's face....20 minutes gone, another 20 left to go. Zoom some more until we fill 40 minutes. Then 5 minutes of actual story development."
"To begin, I believe that most people visiting these pages are intelligent enough to tell the difference between those that are reviewing this series with honesty versus the ones who for reasons other than the viewing experience, wish to tear it down. As someone has already mentioned, the negative reviews are fraught with fear and the worst kind of delusion that exists: self delusion (the delusion a person hides behind and convinces themselves of in order not to see the truth).

The Handmaid's Tale is a series that presents what could happen were women's rights reverted or taken away. There is nothing in my previous sentence that is not true. Let me type it again. The Handmaid's Tale is a series that presents what could happen were women's rights reverted or taken away. Is it an extreme depiction? Let's study that for a moment. In a Puritanical society, the Bible was the sole authority. Puritans believed it applied to every area and level of life. The Salem Witch Trials are one such example of Puritanical beliefs in action. Were it not for historical documentation, you would have people negating those as well. So, as to the question of whether it could or couldn't happen, the people most decrying it and stating that it could not happen, are the ones that most believe it can. Don't let them fool you.

The Handmaid's Tale takes you into this dystopian future, and it has never felt more real. I had to pause it on a couple of occasions to catch my breath. No, it doesn't hit you over the head every so often with good scenes; the beauty of it is that it is equally haunting, strong and breathtaking in its entirety.

To grab from another review: ""The echoes of resemblance to the United States' current political administration create another layer of exceptionalism. Make no mistake, this is a political work. But it makes its case in a way that, like George Orwell's 1984 reflect our world back at us in a mirror that is both familiar and perverse"", and because of it, it is extraordinary.

Rating: ★★★★★★★★★★★ Excellent"
"Strong is the word for this series, and little, weak people detest strong so be prepared for the fake reviews and thumbs down across the actual reviews for it. Fear is a powerful thing.

The Handmaid's Tale is perhaps one of the the best Television accomplishments of not only the year (hands down), but of the decade. It is a profound glimpse into a future that could very well happen were it not for people like most of you and me.

In three unforgettable episodes, so far, women such as Offred (""Of FRED"", since she belongs to Fred), played by the inimitable Elisabeth Moss, are coerced through bodily harm to be both concubine and scape/punching goat for well to do families. These women are subjected to physical, emotional and mental abuse in the name of God, or if not so much in the name of God, under the twisted word of god, by man. This is not to say that it is a Christian-bashing show, but it depicts what could happen under a theocratic society.

What is most outstanding is that the acting is so amazing, that its quietest moments may be its most powerful. In fact, at times, the series can be emotionally overwhelming and draining — but isn't that a characteristic of a superb and masterful viewing experience?

Don't turn away from it."
"Brilliantly written and amazing acting. TV shows like this show a dystopian view of society which seems unrealistic, like it could never happen to us. What is happening during covid times shows exactly how easy it is for a governent to become totalitarian, authoritarian and down right dangerous to our rights and freedoms. We should take a show like this to heart and never let it happen today. This show is scary and full of horrors."
"After 3 and half seasons of the same thing happening over and over, of characters acting irrationally against their own best interests, of June's very sophisticated facial expressions, of one cliff-hanger per episode to keep your curiosity up through the feet-dragging and fake depth... it's probably time to acknowledge that this lemon has already been squeezed dry and move on."
"I have watched seasons 1 to 5 within 2 weeks and I can't wait for season 6. This is an absolutely horrific story. I think this actually could happen and that's the most scary part. There are no bad actors in this TV show. I see a lot of reviews that claim the show is slow. And I guess they're right, but for me it doesn't annoy me at any point. Junes's camera faces annoying? Not at all. This is woman is mad as hell!

I hope I can hold myself to reading the book before this show comes to an end. It's beautiful, stunning and horrific at the same time and I think it's the best show I have ever seen."
"In a world that resembles ""Children of Men"", tormented with ecological disasters and a vision of human extinction - there is a country where citizens decided to take strong actions to prevent from the vision of the grim future. Men are put in charge and women are relieved from their constitution and freedom rights to serve for one purpose only - giving birth to children in a utopian society that follows the rules of Bible. But this show is not just about this - but most of all - it's a study of how a totalitarian regime is born. How a simple and dangerous idea is pushed from the deepest parts of frustrated minds to become a basis for a new society whose happiness is assured by rifles, severe punishments, eradication of basic education and fellings - a society free of any critic thinking, fully devoted to the state. Where fear is the main tool to keep the state united. But like any totalitarian regime - it also starts to eat it's own founders. It's a study of how ordinary people are being corrupted when given absolute power. And it's a study of people who can't stand up and agree to become victims of the cruel ideology. Sounds familiar? This is the show that will help just a little understand the history of the 20th century."
"The first two seasons were indisputably iconic. The rest is Savior Complex on steroids. After season two, I have a theory that each episode would only last about 10 minutes if all of the long silent closeups of June's face were removed. It's obvious that after the book ended and the writers had to get creative, they simply reverted to an old stale plot hole-filled savior complex formula from which apparently American cinema will never evolve."
"SEASON-1 A masterpiece! Put feminism aside for a moment, this is a brilliantly told story whether you are watching it for empowerment or just as a leisure activity. Each and every character, supporting or lead, hero or villain, is well-written and gets his or her own chance to develop. Season One is slow in parts, but each carefully framed shot is purposeful and powerful. There is no holding back in The Handmaid's Tale, and as the story progresses, there are twists and turns that you have never before seen on T.V. SEASON-2 Season Two of The Handmaid's Tale is the perfect continuation of Season One, yet it comes back even stronger with new, shocking conflicts. Moss, Fiennes, and Strahovski all have incredible chemistry together on screen, and this season, the tension is stronger than ever. The Handmaid's Tale manages to get better and better with every episode as the writers and actors push their talents to a whole new level. SEASON-3 I almost gave up on this show after season 2. I am so glad that I didn't. There are so many parallels in our world to draw from. The Underground Railroad of the 1860s, the persecution of Jews in the 1940s and the persecution of women in the modern Middle East all serve as inspirations and are ripe with tales of rebels, agitators and heroes. In a day and age when most of our heroes wear capes or have billion dollar steel armor it's refreshing to see the plain old human spirit alive and kicking ass. Great 10/10"
"If you haven't seen it yet or haven't read the book let's try to set the scene without spoilers;

Mankind is failing, most women are sterile because of industrial pollution (or Mother Nature just having enough of us parasites). Birth rates are plummeting. An ultra religious cult see it as their God given mission to 'save mankind'. They seize power by staging a fake terrorist attack against the US government, impose marshal law and set about rebuilding American society.('War On Terror' anyone?) They use The Old Testament as their blue print, but with some totally wack interpretations and distortions. Fertile women become the property of the state. Brain washed and farmed out to the new ruling elite as baby makers, slavery and subjugation is all they can hope for.

Margaret Atwood, Canadian hero, social commentator, environmentalist, activist, feminist, tech inventor, business woman and visionary always maintained that this isn't sci-fi, but 'speculative fiction', things that have a chance of happening in the near future. Written in the '80's it's probably more profound now; the Neo Con Christian's have become a powerful force in US politics. Could there be a Tea Party without the ultra religious Republicans? Probably not. Maybe it takes a next door neighbour from Canada to really see what's happening with the totally dysfunctional family next door? It has always been a source of debate about how a country so entrenched in the ideas of freedom and liberal philosophy can also be the home of such obvious bigotry and divide? Surely teaching Creationism instead of proved science in some State's schools is a warning sign? Maggie may well ridicule this dogmatic un-thinking, however it's far from funny when she points out the possible end game and consequences for society and women in particular.

The book, although heavy going at first, is one of those you can pick up every few years and just dive right in (thanks to Una for making me read it back in '87). I was worried that this TV adaption wouldn't do it justice. How wrong I was. It's slightly different, and relies on a lot of flashbacks like the original narration; however this narration helps to smooth over the cracks nicely. So it still sticks faithfully to the principles and main events of the story, albeit in a roundabout 'more up to date' way. The subtle creep up and takeover of government and power has been well handled so far. I am enthralled, totally impressed and on tenterhooks with Bruce Miller's adaption. The direction is also smart, (the hanging scene seen from the back of a van was powerful stuff). Every image is a perfect composition, nothing is wasted, it's real art in the hands of skilled camera operators.

The feminism is subtle, not the clumsy and overt 'all men are bad, all women are good little victims' like of some of the more hardcore feminist literature. Maggie recognises that some women can be bad too, and some men will die to do the right thing, as you will see. Her book made a point that this could only happen if most women were willing parties too, and that a 2,000 year old book of moral tales can hold a massive amount of power when deliberately abused in the wrong hands.

It's also highly commendable that the cast are just 'normal folk', no super skinnies, models, hunks or pretty boys are in sight. This makes it all the more believable, it could happen to you and me. The lead, 'Offred' (Elizabeth Moss) absolutely nails it. No spoilers, but she will impress you with her canny nouse and determination to survive despite many obstacles and traps. I haven't seen one bad actor in here so far, they've obviously got bags of talent and emotional range. The design and resurrection of 'The Shaker Movement', as in the book, harks back to an American and European age of persecution and religious fervor.

Adhering to Maggie's descriptions of the colour coded dress, the production designer's subtle placement of now highly valuable Shaker furniture here and there helps; the muted drab colours, even in the opulent wealthy homes, take us sub consciously back to the times of Salem, witch trials, mass hysteria and life devoid of 'modern vices' like free speech, self determination, free love and modern relationships.

I can't wait to see how this progress', although I know how it ends (can't tell you, but get ready for some shocks!). It's been made fresh for me. I hope you will all love it too."
"For starters, i watch promising TV alone, so i can let myself be caught by a good story with no reserve and no distraction. This is important here because the story has enough intensity to distort the perception of time. And it's a real dive. The pacing that may seem slow if you're on the surface is actually impeccable when you are under the spell.

Every second of it, i spent bracing myself with both dread and hope for the next second, the next pronounced word the next piece of this world disclosed, wondering how little it would take nowadays for even a western society to fall into this nightmare, for decent people to become blind to their own cruelty, how hard it would be to reinvent one's own values to be able to endure.

Every episode left me exhausted, I couldn't even binge it as I needed to digest a bit between episodes.

Since then Moss has featured in many other shows, and aesthetic shots from above have been used by other productions too, Roe v. Wade has been overturned, so it might hinder a bit the novelty aspects for newer viewers, but damn, this was quite a journey."
"The Handmaid's Tale is a chilling & gripping series set in a dystopian world where the USA is transformed into a class-based society, with emphasis on fertile women who are treated as property for reproduction. The shows does a great job at depicting brutality, repression, authoritarianism, but also how these acts are justified in various forms. The acting really captures the cultish behaviors that can be found on both left & right extremes of today's ideological spectrum. Season 1-3 are definitely top-tier for those who enjoy dystopian/post-apocalyptic genres with high production.

Season 4 however is a snoozefest. The show has lost steam, there's not much storyline development left and it just drags with no objective or goal. Even the good acting & cinematography can't salvage what was once a solid 8-9."
"This story is terrifying (especially if you are a female). Imagine what happens when the world goes completely crazy and some new completely sadistic world order emerges who claims their acts of incredible cruelty, murder, control , oppression and slavery are all in the name of some mystical God that no one has seen, spoken to or has any proof exists and yet uses the name of God to justify the most horrific and barbaric atrocities.

Without spoiling this is the story about this new world where women who are still able to bear children after the most of society is rendered infertile are made to be handmaidens/slaves to wealthy women who want to have babies but can't. Despite their unique baby making abilities they are still treated like the lowest life form on earth and the only reason they even get to live is because of this ability.

Elizabeth Moss and Alexis Bledel are amazing in their performances along with the rest of the cast. They broadcast the first 3 episodes on Hulu last night and of course I had to binge watch. It made me cry and made me incredibly sad to see how cruel a species humans can be."
"Having grown up with Atwood's writtings - yes, I'm Canadian, and studied them in college, I was apprehensive ""The Handmaid's Tale"" would be given its due but all apprehensions have vanished with each and every season.

Writing, cinematography, score, setting - all are perfection; each a slow seduction into the madness of religiousity and the just exposé of its resulting delusional psychosis. An expertly crafted series born of both brilliantly penned novels.

Let ""Handmaid"" serve as a warning for the diviant political party that has criminally adapted the tale as an instruction manual as its misogynic birthright."
"I wanted to like this series and had actually watched up to Season 2, midway, but I got overwhelmed and just plainly put off by Elizabeth Moss's constant close ups!!!

My exact thought echoed here by several reviewers so apparently I am not alone! Just got tired of her face's weird projection that comes off like she is about to transform into an alien or monster or head about to explode as she semi lift her head with matching head/neck twitching, big ugly stare and pursed lip breathing.... so annoying and distracting!!! I just had enough of her face and felt overdosed that I needed to stop watching the show to get a much needed withdrawal from her."
"The Handmaid's Tale (2017) is a series currently available on Hulu. The storyline follows a virus that sweeps the nation making it challenging to have babies. It tears society apart leaving pockets of civilizations. One of those is known as Gilead where they kidnap the less fortunate, force them to have sex with the men of Gilead hoping they can have children. The wives help in the rape process. One of the women who was kidnapped and forced into being a handmaid remembers life before she was kidnapped where she had a husband and daughter. She will do everything in her power to get back to that lifestyle and help the other handmaids get free too.

This series was created by Bruce Miller (Eureka) and stars Elisabeth Moss (Mad Men), Yvonne Strahovski (Dexter), Ann Dowd (Hereditary), Max Minghella (Spiral), Madeline Brewer (Orange is the New Black), Bradley Whitford (The Cabin in the Woods) and Samira Wiley (Orange is the New Black).

The settings, soundtrack, attire and cinematography is first rate and makes the scenarios feel realistic and authentic. The cast is perfectly selected and it is easy to feel genuinely sorry and hopeful for the various characters while hating the ""villains."" The circumstances are unpredictable, ruthless and intense. The punishments in this are well executed and with the right level of dramatics. The first three seasons are really, really good while the last two seasons have circumstances that feel like a stretch to keep the story going but are still interesting.

Overall, The Handmaid's Tale is a very smart and unique series that is absolutely worth your time. I would score this a 9/10 and strongly recommend it."
"Season 1 was great; really ran with the concept and made the dystopian world of the book believable with much better detail than the 80s film did.

Season 2 was almost as good, necessary backstories shown and resistance began to foment.

Season 3 the show started going off the rails. Instead of having the tone of a show for pay-cable it started resembling the type of dumb sci-fi action shows on the SyFy channel.

I really hoped Season 4 would get back on track of the quality of the earlier seasons, but no, it's even dumber than S3. I'm done. And--good lord--it appears this has been renewed for a 5th season, too! Man, some people are starved for entertainment it seems.

I'm giving it a 5 overall rating just because of the quality of the earlier seasons."
Season 1 still remains the greatest television I've ever seen. McConaughey's best performance to date and Harrelson goes toe-to-toe with him. Everything from the acting (including every minor character) to the writing to the cinematography to the score is phenomenal.
Season 1 of True Detective may be the best television I've ever seen. Its written brilliantly and has some of the best performances I've ever witnessed with Woody and Matthew. They were robbed by not winning an Emmy or Golden Globe.
"The first season of True Detective is among the best television I've ever seen. Just read through the reviews to see how loved that first season was. This show is an anthology series and every season is different in quality. Season 1 is BY FAR the best and again some of the best tv of all-time, Season 2 was not good despite a great cast and Season 3 was back to be watchable again. Now about that first season...it sucks you into the story from the beginning of the first episode and holds onto you throughout the season until that phenomenal ending. Matthew McConaughey and Woody Harrelson are so amazing in this that you forget that they're A-list actors and actually become the characters they are playing. Both of their performances are as good as anything you'll see from a television show. They're about to start filming season 4 and it should be out some time in late 2023. If you haven't seen this series yet then make time as soon as you can (except you can skip Season 2)."
"If you want to skip this review just jump to the IMDb list of awards and nominations, and you're done.

If you want the skinny, let me say this is one of the most perfect dramas ever to grace your flat screen.

Harrelson, you need to understand, is no slouch. He does crazy better than crazy people. And he usually steals any scene not nailed down.

But Matthew McConaughey operates at such a level here -- not to mention the astonishing makeup which makes him appear to be playing his own father -- that he walks off with this production. Mesmerizing.

Everyone is pitch perfect, which I believe explains the casting awards. Even Michelle Monaghan, usually known for getting by on her amazing looks, does more acting her than anytime in her career

((Designated ""IMDb Top Reviewer."" Please check out my list ""167+ Nearly-Perfect Movies (with the occasional Anime or TV miniseries) you can/should see again and again (1932 to the present))"
"Before season one aired I had never seen anything so compelling in storytelling or filmmaking in my entire life. The following two seasons are watchable and well-made but nowhere near as phenomenal as season one. This is a paint-by-numbers example of how to do a gripping and unique story. There is nothing negative I can say about season one. Everything is top-notch. The acting, the story, the camera work, the music, the mood, everything.

We see through the relationship of the two main characters a complicated and sometimes volatile relationship. They aren't enemies but they aren't exactly friends either. The dialogues they share together are some of the most interesting filmmaking I've ever seen. They aren't good men or bad men either. They exist in the grey area. They are just good enough to not be bad but bad enough to not be good. They are stark contrasts of one another as well. The relationship Rust and Marty have evolves constantly throughout the series and is the highlight of the entire show. I cannot recommend this season enough."
"Season 1 True Detective, different actors, different story, different class....absolutely amazing.....the following seasons average in comparison."
"Right when the opening credits start and you hear that morbidly beautiful song 'Far From Any Road' by 'The Handsome Family', you know that this isn't going to be your usual cop show. Now, if you're more into action films, avoid this at all costs - but if you like amazing performances and dark, brooding cinema peppered with some black humour and a slight psychedelic touch, you're going to love this. The atmosphere and the southern ambiance of this show are so rich and the cinematography is so beautiful, I can hardly think of anything in recent TV-history that compares to this. To make a musical analogy: if the crazy, creative energy of 'Breaking Bad' felt like 'Led Zeppelin', this feels more like 'The Doors'. The slow, bluesy, hypnotic pulse of this show draws you in and hooks you - and then it doesn't let go. By the way, the original music is also excellent (T-Bone Burnett) and fits the mood perfectly.

As far as the actors are concerned, there's nothing but great performances. Even the smaller parts are perfectly cast and the two leads: wow, just - wow! Harrelson (freshly returned from 'The Hunger Games'), plays the ""normal"", more down to earth character, while McConaughey (still marked by his own personal hunger games) nails the part of his slightly mad, highly intelligent but nihilistic and severely depressed partner. Watching them play off each other (again, after 'Edtv' and 'Surfer, Dude') while their conflicted - and conflicting - characters try to solve a ritual murder is so captivating (and so much fun) I honestly don't care that much if they are ever going to solve that crime.

So for the moment, I'm giving this 10 stars (I can still take back a few if it all goes downhill from here), because in my opinion, there wasn't a single note out of key so far. The writing is top notch, and if the creative team behind this can keep it up, this could turn out to be HBO's next 'Wire' in terms of quality. Cary Fukunaga ('Sin Nombre','Jane Eyre'), who will hopefully one day adapt Stephen King's 'It', proves once more that he's a very accomplished director and a talent to look out for in the future.

My verdict: if you like a well told, character driven story (that might lead you to some very dark places) and if you're not put off by a rather considerate pace, I can't recommend this show enough - this is some great television.

"Season one is a beautiful thing.

Then Vince Vaughan happened and the less said about that the better."
"Cohle and Hart play off eachother so amazingly well, and I was stunned by the constant wisdom on humanoids thrown out by Cohle constantly in the first episodes. I've never felt such a deep connection to a characters' thoughts ever and was taken aback by how deeply I could resonate to these thoughts on humanoids.

These constant spurts of wisdom sold me on S1 from the first episode. It was amazingly depicted and I had to calm down through the dialogue and replay some bits because there was just so much stuff being said which required processing. I'll return to S1 in a couple of years to understand the wisdom bits deeper, and enjoy this masterfully created piece again.

There was not a single dull moment in this series, despite being a slow-burner if that's what you want to call it. I'd say it's similar to mindhunter S1 but they're not really comparable in that way. You'll understand once you see it.

Hart and Cohle played their characters ridiculously well and built this incredible depth to their stories and personalities that I have never seen before in TV. It made the series feel extremely mature in a sense that only people with proper understanding of their own emotions could understand the thought processes depicted in the series. Maggie was such a perfect character to make sure these thought processes were fished out. Amazing performance! I really have nothing but praise for S1.

Just like Maggie said, Hart did not know what he wanted, and Cohle knew what he wanted. It is such a small line but it says so incredibly much. This world is divided like this and you can see it in all adults of all ages. Some people know who they are and therefore content with themselves, with integrity (just like Cohle) and some people are figuring things out at their own pace, but never really reaching the destination in terms of self actualization (Hart). Maggie was much more similar to Cohle and it was depicted masterfully.

Either way I'm just going off on nothing here. Best Series I've watched and I feel like I evolved as a person after S1. Thank you!

I'm not mentioning S2 and S3 and will not watch them as other reviews have made it clear I shouldn't. Haha."
The first season is an amazing
"I watched season 1 again last week and I am still in awe of every element of this masterpiece. The pace, the acting, everything is so perfect it is mindblowing. I remember the excitement of waiting for season 2, which evaporated after episode 1. Vince Vaughan seems to always carry the can for this seasons issues but they were far larger than one man. I was astounded how bad the second was to the first. The third season, I watched it, I can't remember it. Other than to say it was better than the stinker in the middle."
"(Review updated after Season 4).

A murder-mystery series with each season set in a different location, with different characters, and independent from the others.

Season 1 of True Detective was great. A slow-burning, incredibly intriguing crime-drama. Viewers were fed pieces of information regarding the crime, complete with a few red herrings and sudden bursts of action. All this was interspersed with the private lives and dramas of the two detectives (played superbly by Matthew McConoughey and Woody Harrelson). Plus, the finale was an incredible adrenaline rush of action. This all made for a highly intriguing, engaging and entertaining season.

In Season 2 creator Nic Pizzolatto tried the same thing: a slow-burn, with a rush of action towards the end. However, the first half of the season is too unfocused to be engaging. You have whole 50- minute episodes where you feel you really only got maybe 10 minutes of entertainment or information out of it. So many scenes with people staring blankly at each other for minutes on end...

I understand what he was trying to do: develop the characters, give us small pieces of information, build the background and intrigue. However, this time the story develops too slowly to maintain, or even develop, any engagement with the characters.

By the time you reach the climax of the season, you are so disengaged you hardly care who the characters are. E.g. Someone dies. You're pretty sure you're supposed to know the character and their relevance to the story but you were zoned out whenever their character was mentioned or had screen time. Thus, a piece of the puzzle dissolves.

All this leads to a massive dissipation of intrigue, and watching is just a chore - you're in this far, might as well see it through.

Add in some terrible miscasting and performances - Vince Vaughan should stick to B-grade comedies and Taylor Kitsch should stick to whatever he does best (this isn't it) - and a damp squib of a finale and Season 2 is very disappointing.

Season 3, released 3½ years after Season 2, initially looked very promising and had the potential to see a return to the form of Season 1. Puzzling mystery and a 3-time period storyline made for intriguing and engaging drama.

However, the mystery soon dissipated as the 3-time period formula gave away much of where the mystery was heading. Rather than being a murder mystery it became a human/relationship drama, and not a very interesting one. Nic Pizzolatto did his best to recreate the dark, brooding atmosphere that permeated Season 1 but it can't hide the lack of genuine intrigue or of character engagement. Good ending though.

Season 4 is easily the worst season of the lot. After Seasons 2 and 3 were so lacklustre I was hesitant to watch it. However, the plot seemed interesting so I gave it a go. Initially the plot was intriguing and the setting - Alaska during days with 24 hours of night - made for a great backdrop that should have created a great atmosphere. This initial watchability was short-lived, however: the season reached its highpoint about 20 minutes in and then went continuously downhill from there.

All the potential shown in the first 20 minutes is wasted as for the next five episodes all we largely have is pointless domestic stuff and other empty filler. The mystery, despite being the reason everyone watched the show, seems to take a backseat. Even when things do progress on that front it's in implausible, random, style-over-substance ways. The ending is particularly disappointing - I'd rather not have known what happened and who did it as the plot is incredibly weak, to the point of being laughable.

Hopefully this is the final season as everything that has happened after Season 1 just brings down the True Detective brand.

Season ratings: S1 - 9/10, S2 - 5/10, S3 - 6/10, S4 - 4/10."
"Watch the show and make up your own mind. I've seen too many people regurgitating the same ""SEASON 1 IS AMAZING, SEASON 2 IS THE WORST OF ALL TIME"" junk, and it's simply not true.

Fact of the matter is this is an anthology series. Different people, different stories, different feels. If they wanted a show with 3 seasons of Matthew McConaughey and Woody Harrelson, they would have done that.

Some detective stories are eerie and disturbing. Some are broody and slow burning. Season 2 is the latter, and all the hate it gets for basically not being exactly like the first season detracts from the performances and character arcs within.

There are also a lot of complaints about Vince Vaughn? Aside from some stiff writing, I hardly see the issue. He's got some great scene-chewing moments as a brutal crime boss!

I honestly can't believe some publications labeled this as one of the worst seasons of television in 2015. Just goes to show that some people have no clue how to manage their expectations, and this site is no different. Look at what I've said, and now put it up against so many here...it's ridiculous.

Like I said: watch it and make up your own mind. I avoided it for 5 years because of this site and I regret it. Season 2 isn't season 1, just like season 3 isn't 1 or 2. If you want the same thing over and over again, watch CSI."
"This crime drama is centred on two Louisiana detectives, Marty Hart and Rust Cohle and their investigation of a particularly disturbing murder. A woman's naked body was found at a remote location; posed with a stag's antlers on her head and with strange 'stick sculptures' nearby. This crime took place in 1995 and we are shown it in flashback as other officers interview them about the case in 2012. Inevitably as the season progresses the plot deepens, more potential victims emerge along with various suspects.

If you like your crime drama to be fast paced and action packed then this might not be for you; it moves at a fairly slow pace. This doesn't mean it is boring though; quite the opposite. I was gripped from start to finish. While there isn't a lot of action there is some and occasionally there are sudden moments of shocking violence. As much as the story is about solving a crime it is about its effects on our two protagonists; Woody Harrelson and Matthew McConaughey really impress in these roles. The latter is particularly good as Cohle is so different in 1995 and 2012. The series has a great look with the Louisiana scenery almost being another character... it looks as if nature is just waiting to take over. As the story approaches its conclusion it employs tropes one might expect in a horror film leading me to wonder about the safety of Marty and Rust. Overall I'd definitely recommend watching this; this season has a proper conclusion so it can be enjoyed on its own; on the strength of this I'll watch further seasons given the chance."
"When i first heard about the show , i thought to myself that with a premise and cast like that , what could go wrong with this show? Well there could have been a lot of things. For example the plot may have been overdone or under thought , direction may have been all over the place , but the first episode proved that it was not to be so.

The plot looks delicious...yes it does and the neat direction just purely compliments the smooth design of the show. Even though story telling is non linear at times , but it has been managed very well with subtle dialogue and the growing suspense. It does get dark at times but handles all its complications with ease.

The casting is clever...very clever. Both Matthew McConaughey and Woody Harrelson are brilliant actors and at the same time have a certain mystery about them that is Perfect for the show. They have a firm grip of their respective characters and seem dissolved in them.

This show is NOT just a regular cop drama or a clichéd murder mystery. It is much much more and has already proved so in the first episode. Much is expected from it and the future looks bright for True Detective.

UPDATE ( Episode 2-6 ) - Now 6 episodes have gone by and i believe my views have changed a little. The richness of the show in the first couple of episodes completely PALES in comparison to the speed, smoothness and uniqueness in the latter episodes. From the 4th episode is when the show actually picked even more momentum and proved its worth as possibly the greatest thing on television at the moment. McConaughey is truly having the golden period of his career. The future (probable) Academy Award winner (For DBC) is at his freaking best as Rust Cohle. Harrelson is brilliant as the angry and flawed Marty Hart. I liked this show. But now i am addicted to it.

With 2 more episodes of the season to go , one can only expect the best from this fast-paced , beautifully crafted show.

So far, an obvious 10/10.

Final update: ( Episode 7 & 8 )-- Well the series ended last night on a very thoughtful note. Up until the 7th episode, the show had picked up so much speed and given us so much to think about that i was expecting a little too much from the last couple of episodes. Who wasn't.

*********** If you haven't seen the series , please Don't read on*********

The 7th episode was truly amazing as it set the stage for Rust and Marty's final adventure of the series. There was too much anticipation for the final episode, but did it deliver. Yes and No, depending entirely on how you look at it. There were no unusual shocking twists and there were no unrealistic happenings. It was quiet a daring and a brilliant end to a show that explored beyond any other show's reach. But to be very honest, as a single episode , the finale wont stand out. But as an entire series , i believe we have been treated to one of the best television series ever made. The writing and direction have been top notch. Acting has been flawless. Am gonna miss it.

10/10"
"This show is fantastic. Both Woody Harrelson and Matthew McConaughey are stellar and the rest of the cast are amazing. Every person gives meaning to there character. The story is dark but it never gets to dark. It adds some humor every now and then which is done well. Also there is not a lot of Action so if your looking for a Action filled series this is not for you. Dialogue is well written you can tell that a lot of time was put into the shows script. Cinematography is absolutely jaw dropping they have some beautiful shots in the first 3 episodes. There is 0 shaky cam for those that hate it. I hope this show has a long run because it's fantastic and it really stands out from the rest of the crime shows out right now. Overall I recommend this show to people that are looking for a stellar story. Absolutely brilliant 10/10

*Edit* 2/24/14: Just finished episode 6 and I like how this is all playing out. I am really looking forward to watching the rest of the season.

*Edit* 3/10/14: Now that True Detectives first season is over. I have to say that this season will go down as one of the best achievements in Television history. The amount of emotions this season had was unbelievable. Truly some of the best Television I have watched."
"True Detective is an absolutely incredible crime series. I've had to come back and revise my original comment because they just released season 4 so I had to include that in my comment. Like most others here have already said, Season 1 was on a different level. It was so good, so original and so incredibly acted, written, directed, etc that it was hard for the other seasons to live up to that first season. Season 2, even though it had an amazing cast, was not very good at all and easily the weakest of them. Season 3 was better and absolutely worth watching. Now, season 4 just ended and it was fantastic. I couldn't stop watching, I waited to the end of the season before I started it so I can binge it and I'm glad I did because that's the best way to watch it. Every season is different with a different story and a different cast so you don't have to watch in order. I absolutely recommend you watch season 1 and 4 though. If you have the time you can watch season 3 without being disappointed but skip season 2 all together."
I have only watched the first season of True Detective and currently do not intend to watch the other two seasons. Season 1 is absolutely brilliant. Woody Harrelson is great as Marty Hart but Matthew McConaughey shines as Rust Cohle. The story is fantastic. The cinematography is gorgeous. The opening credits are awesome. The balance between the crime investigation and character development on point. This is probably one of the greatest things I've ever seen.
"This is a show which almost bathes in success before it's begun. With it's cast and their pedigree of work i cant see many people interested in this type of television not seeing it.

Regardless the pilot grips you with non-linear suspense driven story telling. Vaguely some kind of serial killer murders young women in a ritualistic manner and our 2 protagonists catch the case. What follows is a tantalising taste of what I'm sure will become one of the most well wrought shows of the year, as is the norm for HBO. Teased with mystery and the promise of a story worth hearing being told in a superb manner, Its hard not to fully recommend every mature adult checking this show out.

The only demographic that wont be thoroughly satisfied with this work are people looking for lighter ""easy watching"" style programs. This isn't an episodic cop show, True Detective is dark and unapologetically twisted."
"Nic Pizzolatto, creator and writer of the magnificent first season of True Detective, had nothing to do with Season 4. At this point, the series has become a sad exercise in branding.

Season 4 is set in small-town Alaska with a cast of sad-sack characters leading lives of quiet desperation under the long Arctic night when a horrific, possibly supernatural mass murder takes place. In the hands of a talented writer, that's a terrific set-up. Unfortunately the writing is dull and unimaginative. The characters are two dimensional, unlikeable, their personal problems uninteresting, stumbling from one cliche to the next. Four episodes into Season 4, the story seems barely interested in the crime as much as these dull characters. It even seems barely interested in the Arctic setting which so lends itself to horror (see Fortitude or The Head for how to do this well). The portrayal of native Alaskans, another potentially interesting part of the setting, is trite and one-dimensional (dignified spiritual warriors who know so much the clueless white folk don't...).

Is it right to dismiss a series based only on four episodes? It's not the destination, it's the journey. When the journey thus far is so uninspired, the ending is beside the point.

If you loved True Detective Season 1, and kept the hope alive through subsequent disappointing seasons that the original magic might return... Season 4 should be the final clue that it's time to let it go."
"I LOVE what they did to S04! /s

With S04 we get none of that ""boring"" detective show that was S01-S03 with all its fancy procedural policework, well-written dialogue, complex characters and their focus on the main mystery that we as viewers get invested in and tangled up with.

No, no.

We finally get the highly unoriginal Netflix soap opera with dialogue written by a teenager (I mean, who needs all the ""fancy talk"" of earlier seasons, right?), with one-dimensional characters who all have a ""daaaark and hidden past"" that are revealed episode by episode (so we can slooowly check on our ""overused trope"" bingo chart which stereotypical dark past each character has) and a writer/director that is bold enough to drop all this ""fancy detective stuff"" and gives us viewers what we always wanted: a soap opera with loooots of drama, frequent yet dime-a-dozen interpersonal conflicts and pointless supporting characters that all have pointless storylines that are not connected to the case at all and just use up valuable screentime (this is a good thing because otherwise we would have to watch the ""booring"" detective stuff and casework and such...).

I love how they realized that no one is watching a show called ""True DETECTIVE"" to enjoy the interesting cases, the mystery and the detective aspect so they (very intelligently) don't even waste screentime on it, the mystery and the case itself is used as a mere backdrop, maybe 10% of the show is about the actual cases, so the rest of the 90% can be used to have some more saucy drama and soap opera conflicts.

I also love how formulaic this season is, here is how most episodes are ""written"":


Then finally R-E-P-E-A-T, so we can go back to the begininng of this circle.

I love how the writers of this show actually implemented the idea from the first season that ""time is a flat circle"" by making all their episodes follow this circular structure where we feel like we go in circles with nothing is happening and by also making this season as flat and boring as they could. This just shows the genius writing, the humbling respect and the deep knowledge the creators must have for the original brand.

So all in all 10/10, amazing soap opera with no bs ""detective stuff""."
"Just finished what I'm pretty sure is a fourth rewatch of the first season. I'm one of the few it seems that also enjoyed seasons 2 & 3 but not remotely as much as I enjoy season one, completely different category.

The characters of Rust and Marty lock you in within the first episode. Their performances are just incredible and the dynamic of their relationship is so fun.

That incredible cast combined with beautiful cinematography and gripping storytelling makes the first season a detective classic. I'm a bit frustrated that the first season wasn't kept as a stand alone mini-series because the other seasons could just never hold up to that masterpiece."
"Brooklyn Nine-Nine is easily one of my favorite sitcoms of all-time. It tells the story of the detectives of Brooklyn's 99th Precinct and their office manger. The detectives are all offbeat and easy to fall in love with. They will do anything to find their criminal and have plenty of fun along the way. Every character on the show is hilarious, there's not a weak link among them. There's literally not a bad character on the entire show. It's also one of the rare shows where every season is just as hilarious as the one's before it. The cast is incredible led by Andy Samberg, Terry Crews, Melissa Fumero, Andre Braugher, Joe Lo TruglioI, among others. It also has an endless supply of cameos throughout the series that are all fantastic. If you want a show that will make you laugh out loud then this is it."
Brooklyn Nine-Nine is not only laugh out loud funny but it's one of the most underrated comedies of all-time! It's one of the rare comedies where every character on the show is almost as ridiculously funny as the others. It's also one of the rare shows where every season is just as hilarious as the one's before it. I can't say enough about how hilarious this show really is so just watch it for yourself!
"Brooklyn Nine-Nine is definitely one of my favorite ever sitcom. It's a show of pure comedy with humorous stories that are naturally delivered by the lovely actors and actresses, but also with a consistent storyline which a lot of sitcoms lack. The other thing I've noticed which makes this show better is the exclusion of laugh tracks. Although, laugh tracks do, to a certain extent, seem to make shows more hilarious and to a point where even if you don't understand a joke, you'd laugh. But no, this show has no cheats like that and amuses viewers with original content. The show also does not rely on one-liners or simple jokes, and instead, make use of the characters' personalities and actions to entertain viewers, which is pretty smart. Some might think that entertainment with personalities do not last as they stay the same and eventually people would get tired of them. However, with the ongoing characters development, their personalities and stories are often changing, which makes the show so fresh all the time."
"I just started watching this show after my daughter talked me into it. I was laughing so hard I was crying sometimes. I love the characters, they play off each other perfectly and I have no idea how the Captain keeps a straight face all the time. Some shows just have it-that chemistry, good actors, good writing. This is one of those shows. I was sad to hear they cancelled it, but hopeful now that I hear another company picked it up. All I can hope for is the same experience as the show goes on."
"Please please please don't cancel the show,this show is too funny to be canceled especially on a cliff hanger"
"B99 is a rare gem among serial comedy duds. It's such a smart and fast-paced show that never fails to make me laugh, smile, and sometimes cry at very touching and human moments. This is a comfort show for me and I love rewatching for the running gags, callbacks to previous episodes, and to see the character development as they grow as people in ways that don't feel forced or contrived.

The characters start out fairly rough and jagged with their own individual struggles but grow as a squad after the introduction of Capt. Holt. This is a feature, not a bug! The point of the show is that they're flawed!

Do not listen to anyone who rates this lower than a seven, most of the people who do can't be bothered to spell names right (racist much?)."
"I respect that different people have different tastes in music, clothes, women, movies etc...but if you are saying that this show is bad I really feel like your sense of humor is lacking. I'm a detective for one of the largest police departments in the country and I will advise everyone that doesn't realize it but this show is closer to how real police go about their day than any of those CSI, or garbage procedural shows. Cops do all that stuff all day...pranking each other, busting balls, trying to have a little fun. The job gets a little heavy sometimes so if we didn't have some fun it would be long days. This show is hilarious and perfectly timed retorts by Braugher and Crews are classic. Its the low key lines that make I hilarious...the over the top cheap laughs are somethkng all shows have to do to please the masses...who are stupid. Pay attention to the underlying comedy...its priceless.......""Terry does love yogurt"""
"I don't usually write reviews, but I felt compelled especially due to all the negative reviews due to a few bad episodes. As a whole, this show is hilarious, and heartwarming. I've watched it many times over and it doesn't get old. Season 8 has a few episodes that are very political, and while it doesn't bother me that they decided to talk about real subjects, the execution was poor. That said, it's very extreme to give it a 1 star rating because of that and very unfair when the show was consistently good up until then. And the series finale more than makes up for it. Overall, great show and highly recommend."
"This show was great until i the last season. I have no issue with shows tackling social issues, but it's as if the writers got lazy. It was so woke that it was painful. It just seemed so forced and unnatural.

A shame they ended the show this way."
They ruined season 8. I understand that a lot has happened and I completely understand that the stuff wasn't okay at all. But this a comedy and I want to laugh not listen about politics. If I wanted that I would watch the news.
Spoiler alert: this is one of my favorite shows. An incredible blend of lovable and hilarious characters. So much fun. So many laugh out loud moments. Even on a second full watch through I find myself laughing loudly in delight at this great gem of a show. It's a must watch IMO
This show is just good fun to watch good by yourself or with someone it's just enjoyable tv great stories and characters please do watch this show it's worth it
"I tend to have to find things in between a kids show and adult shows so the whole family can watch and not want to pull our hair out listening to Peppa Pig's annoying voice. 99 did the trick for us. We watched the entire 5 seasons over many months and were entertained. I found myself wanting to watch the next episode before it was family time... so I ended up watching some episodes twice.

Generally it is a bunch of cops trying to do their jobs. It's less about the situation and more about the dialogue and how it's delivered. The do come out with some serious situations every once in awhile but even then it's handled with the same comedic dialogue as most of the other shows. Very well done, will be waiting for more seasons."
"It was a very good series. It was a fun, funny, excellent character series. Far from sit-com clichés. I can't find anything else to write, it was so good and great. The opening scenes were generally very good. I will miss this series. The acting was perfect...Last season was a little weak. There were a few episodes where they were terrible. But the series had an excellent finale. There was one character in the series that I didn't like at all, and that was Gina. She was a very annoying and boring character, but Chelsea Perreti played it very well. I had heard the show was funny and entertaining, but I hadn't started watching it. But at a time when my work was busy, I started watching it to relax and have fun, and while I was watching this series, I couldn't watch any other series.

Cool Cool Cool Cool."
The cold opens for B99 are always hilarious. I love this show so much. It does a great job of balancing comedy with personal issues. It is the only show on that is consistently funny every single week.
"This show went from being incredible to a disaster as soon as it hit the hands of NBC!

The last season is a disaster! Some shows decline in quality and humour over time but this was jaw dropping.

If you are new to the show, watch the end of season 6 and MAYBE one or two of season 7 and then do yourself a favour and stop."
"Brooklyn Nine Nine is a new age police procedural comedy with an excellent cast and spectacular production. But that isn't what makes the show great, rather its something very trivial. The show, being a comedy, peculiarly enough,doesn't use any laugh track or a live audience to record laughs. In fact, they just provide us with a sketch where the viewer can decide whether it was funny enough for him to enjoy (laugh) or not.The show should be credited for its humorous subplots within an episode.The cast also portray their characters in an outstandingly witty fashion. The writer's vision of a comic police station is right on the money. I may have been biased so i couldn't think of flaws. An Amazing show. One of 2013's best."
"After first hearing about Brooklyn Nine-Nine, I was fairly skeptical about yet another attempt on Fox's part to regain their former position as king of network comedy, however; minutes after it had started, I was able to find an affection for this show that I haven't had for a comedy pilot since The Office.

Anchored in large part by Andy Samberg's ironic sense of humor, it also features plenty of dead-pan humor and caricatures, much of it being a parody of the typical crime drama.

Half-way through, I realized it felt fairly reminiscent of The Office's early days, unbeknownst to me that was intended to channel that style and humor, despite it not being a mockumentary.

Personally, I felt it to be one of the strongest pilots for a comedy I had seen in a while. They introduce the audience to the characters in a way that doesn't come across as them trying to bluntly introduce us, as so many shows clumsy do; Shows that tell us how close two friends are in a way real people don't talk, by having one of them tell the other, ""I know you said you didn't want to hang out Friday but I'm your best friend and we're going to hang out."" Brooklyn 9-9 accomplishes these crucial initial first impressions by not overstating the core personalities of the characters. Half way in, we quickly begin to experience the precincts average day and learn of the quirky interactions that occur between characters alongside the new C.O., Capt. Holt(Andre Braugher). Some characters do leave something to be desired in terms of having something to offer to the show, but the groundwork is solid.

There certainly is the expected detective work, but the main focus is the ludicrous and off-beat styles of the detectives. One of the best things I like about this show, thus far, is the fact that it is able to surprise me with its jokes, most of which are not exactly the shock-value type that are only there because they're so random they're humorous. Though as I recall, that style is mixed in with other, more witty jokes.

I don't see this as a show that will appeal to mass audiences, simply because it is more quirky and witty, though not necessarily requiring its viewers to think more about the jokes.

People who enjoy(ed) shows like The Office, Parks and Rec., Community, South Park, Psych, possibly Modern Family, etc., will more likely than not find something to like about this show.

Obviously not everyone will appreciate it, but I strongly encourage those who are interested in watching it, to watch the entire pilot before making a full opinion.

In the end, Brooklyn Nine-Nine is a fun and silly satire about the clichés of police shows, while still able to not take itself too seriously."
"What happened to B99? Stop at season 7, 8 is trash."
"Truly a comedic masterpiece. Enjoy each and every episode. The Cast is perfectly en-sync and compliment each other. Andy Samberg a.k.a. Jake Peralta is the topping on the Nine-Nine Sundae (Without him the show just melts off).... He brings it all together. Melissa Fumero , Andre B. and Joe Lo T. (Along with Andy) are Amazing (Rather A-M-A-Z-I-N-G) at their roles and their characters seem to just envelope you into their roles and force you into binge watching the show from dusk to dawn. Whereas, Stephanie Beatriz, Terry Crews, Chelsea Peretti play their characters to perfection adding to the hysteria the show gets you into.....

Love it....Love it.... Love the show...Never want the show to end...... Wish they keep renewing the series over and over again...

Three Cheers for the Entire team ... Even Scully and Hitchcock .... and the other extras who keep coming in at different times.

Keep up the Amazing work"
"I used to actively communicate to others that this show sucked. I hadn't even watched one full episode! I've seen every episode of family guy, futurama, and American dad many many times and I was getting bored of reruns. I saw this on demand and thought I might as well give it a try. I put on the first episode and was like ""Yup it's crap just like I remembered, but I can't take seeing more reruns so I'll just leave it on in the background while I scroll online"" A few episodes later I was hooked. Some people don't like the simplicity of the animation but that's what makes it unique. I love the hand drawn look. I used to hate that all the characters ""sounded the same"" I used to say. Now I think it's funny that they have masculine sounding voices.

Bobs characters is truly amazing and Lynn is so lovable. The kids are absolutely hilarious I will admit sometimes Gene try's too hard to make jokes but that's just the way gene is. He's always being a jokester. My favourite is Louise and Tina. I like the socially awkward Tina and the mature witty yet childlike Louise. These characters all have such depth that you really don't see in other cartoons. I really like that. I very much dislike teddy. The names of characters are also hilarious. Fish odour omg love it. I say watch one season before you give up on this one. It takes time to get to know the amazing characters. It took me a while to come around."
"I can't believe the amount of flack this show is receiving from the simple-minded and humorless... I have news for everyone: New episodes of the Simpsons are trash... Family Guy hasn't been relevant or clever in ages... American Dad and The Cleveland Show are rip-off cash-ins. I actually read one comment that stated ""Give Seth Macfarlane another show!"" God forbid! I was a huge fan of Futurama, About the first 10 seasons of the Simpsons, Clone High, Mission Hill, Undergrads, About the first four seasons of Family Guy... so on and so forth. This is the first show that has made me really laugh in a long time. It's clever, and the humor is a bit dryer and more subtle. There are some pretty crude stuff I suppose...

I dunno. I seriously think that people have forgotten what it's like to watch something that isn't preachy, in-your-face, and blatant.

At least this show incorporates its jokes into the story and episode arch... as opposed to Family Guy's idiotic asides..."
"When I first saw the commercials about a new cartoon-series I wasn't really impressed. Bobs burgers, about a burgershop, really..? The style was a strong reminder of Beavis and Butthead and the short commercial didn't really impress me much. Maybe I was a bit skeptical because the last years no cartoon or animation series has impressed me much. Brickleberry for example never made me laugh and I didn't like any of the characters.

When it comes to that, TV is riddled with the McFarlane cartoons and even though I still like family guy (not love), its all becoming a tad repetitive.

So I gave Bob's Burgers a chance. I had to get used to the style and wasn't convinced a Burgershop could deliver anything fun, but after a few ep's I am pleasantly surprised. The pace is really good, dialogs are fast and you have to take notice of all or you will miss a joke or clever pun. The cartoon-style works, it gives a bit of 80's nostalgia and it just looks funny - seeing Louise go nuts wearing those ears is just a funny sight.

The characters all work for me, I noticed a lot dislike Gene but I can see him fit in. He delivers a lot of clever (superfast) jokes (scrotumwax!) so for me he adds.

Even the 'recurring characters' deliver, my fav would be Teddy (""we need a bigger restaurant!"").

All in all its well-made and reasonably original (wich is rare these days) and it's actually funny. It may need to grow on you, I needed a few episodes but now I am a fan."
"The Belcher family is unique to television in that they all love and respect each other. It took me a few episodes (mostly, after I cleared a bumpy Season 1) to figure this out, but Linda and Bob really do love and respect each other, and they really do love and respect their kids. In turn, their kids, really do love and respect their parents. And, perhaps most bizarrely to modern television, the kids love and respect each other and work, go to school with, and play with each other, as well. And, it's a secular, non-patriarchal family (it appears to be egalitarian).

They manage all of that, and still manage to be hilarious, season after season. Fantastic character-writing. Fantastic story-telling. They are skipping the guns and violence, the prevalent name-calling, the shaming and fighting that you can see in any other family-oriented, or kid-oriented shows.

I love Linda's love-of-life. So many good things (paragraphs) could be said about her. Oddly, I love that she's voiced by a man. I love her sister, too!

I love Bob's steadfastness against changing his restaurant's core value: Quality Ingredients, and his fear of failure. He's so lovable and terribly vulnerable, (and he can SING!); he's a far cry from ""Archer."" Kudos to the writers and the voice actor to separate the two (But bravo for the mashup ""Archer"" episode that has Archer working at the restaurant... ""Better break-out the purple stuff..."").

I love Tina's crazy introduction into puberty. Her moaning (and head bang or faint) for the whole scene, or on key words whenever she is depressed it makes me laugh every single time. Her daydreams are spot-on for hormone-poisoning, as we used to call it. I love that she's the oldest, but gets steered by the sharp-as-a-tack youngest child, Louise.

I love Gene's complete lack of shame and his total joy when wears any female clothes, even though I believe he's heterosexual. He's just got two sisters, so it's no big deal. He says the most amazing stuff about the opposite sex, it just cracks me up. It's refreshing, non-challenging, and no bravado or shaming. The whole family is so accepting of Marshmallow, and that's lovely. It should be like that everywhere.

I love Louise because she is the baby of the family, and somehow, she became the instigator, the troublemaker, the pusher, and the rabble-rouser, but still she is not evil or despicable, by any means. She's not a pathological liar or cheat, or hateful or mean at all. She's clever and happy and looks out for her siblings. Or, gets them to work for her. Whichever suits her best at which ever moment she chooses. Oh, the jawbreaker episode?! So gross! Poor Tina!

A special shout-out to Teddy, Mort and Jimmy Pesto! Then there's all of the kids...

I don't know how this show continues to do it, season after season, but this is a hilarious, amazing and RARE family, that is still going strong in 2020. And, wow, we really need the laughs now more than ever.

More, please!"
"I can not tell you how many times I've rewatched this show, it is one of my absolute favorites and definitely my favorite animated show. If anyone is looking for a funny, but wholesome show, you've found it."
"I am an avid fan of animated television, and have a massive appreciation for MacFarlane's Family Guy, American Dad and The Cleveland Show. And also The Simpsons and Futurama. While Groening and MacFarlane are cartoon tycoons currently dominating animated programming, Bob's Burgers is a pleasing, utterly enjoyable change.

The pace and rapport of all the characters is one that is rare in any other cartoons. This pace is further backed up by the exceptional vocal performances and direction. Bob's monotonous exasperation at his children's outbursts is just hilarious. The script and dialogue of Tina, Gene and Louise is superb. Tina's voice, personally, I find extremely funny. The humour of a situation slowly evading Bob, mainly, is well accommodated by the episode lengths.

I haven't laughed so hard at a comedy since that seen in The US Office where they all start singing staying alive by the bee gees to keep the beat for CPR of the practice dummy."
"I absolutely love this show. I have never fallen in love with a television show as quickly as I have with this one.

The humor is original, fresh, and it completely helps push the plot of each show along instead of throwing in humor that is completely unrelated to the plot. There is no comparison between this show and other animated comedies on television currently. Family Guy, The Simpsons, and other shows on TV now are re-using jokes and going for the easy laugh with sex jokes, but Bob's Burgers has smart comedy that often hits you a few minutes later. The characters are all so different, quirky, and lovable! I can see the typical family dynamic and it depicts families as they are. I love it. This show is great and I hope it keeps going!"
"Bobs Burgers is the definition of relaxation. Everything about bobs burgers just works. The acting is on point and is easily one of the best voice acting today. Each plot works perfectly. And the animation is great. This is a short but sweet review, because there really isn't anything to say other than to watch it. This show is going to run for a long time and it should. Overall this is a must watch show for anyone who likes comedy, it is very consistent and is the best adult animation show running currently. Between that Archer and Rick & Morty. It is a likeable show with likeable characters with great writing and animation."
"New things come and go and many are easily forgotten. There are so many shows now a days. It's hard to keep track of the good with all of the carp that some how makes it into our homes. I am so glad to say that Bobs Burger is one of those shows that you will be happy found it's way. Many things made this show be added to my favorite list and my DVR. Firstly, I love the animation. Instead of trying to look like Family Guy, The Simpsons or King of the Hill, this show stands out as looking completely different. It is gritty and looks like something that would have been on MTV in the mid 80s or early 90s. That makes me like it even more. I am writing a kids book and seeing stuff like this makes me feel good. Not everything has to look so polished. Another thing I like is the dark humor. It is the kind of thing that if you stop paying attention for just a minute, you won't get something later. I actually laughed out loud at this time after time. Which is rare these days. Something else I like about this show is the people doing the voices. Especially H. Jon Benjamin. The story I saw was really funny and memorable. All these things make me really excited about the next episode.

I must say though, I have a bad feeling Fox is going to boot this show. It just does not fit in with there other shows. Everything on Sunday nights looks the same. This seems like it would fit better on Adult Swim or Comedy Central. So let us all hope Fox is smart and keeps this show on. I am already excited about getting a season pass and buying it on Blu Ray when it is available!!!!"
"I might be alone here, but of the 9 episodes out so far- only 3 have been up to par. Lots of side stories that go nowhere and don't add anything to the overall plot. When it hits, it really knocks it out of the park (Pixie Parade). But when it falls short, it bombs. Like a Ferrari on a highway with speed cameras every 100 yards.

Every season prior has 1, maybe 2 episodes out of 22 that's not a gem. Season 12 is the opposite, its just not landing for me (which is heartbreaking bc I want this show to have a Simpsons-esque run!). Maybe a few new writers & storylines can get the show back on track."
"I loved this series! I wish it would come back to Netflix - it is so funny, cute and quirky!"
"I laughed my head off from the first minute until the end. I think the dry, real, banal, hilarious, humor is amazing. Best thing on TV since the Simpsons and Family Guy! Bravo! I can't wait for more! These writers and actors have nailed a reality like no others. I love the take it on the chin frustration. Right on. If you don't get it...you don't get it. If you do you know ""its people""! i was convinced from the trailers that I would like it and I did. I waited for weeks for this show to come on, then when it did I was out of town and had to catch it on Hulu.com, fortunately. Great work Fox! I think if the network doesn't get the response they need or want there will be a huge following on the web."
"This show was amazing for many years. The first 11 seasons are comedy gold, and will age wonderfully. Idk what happened after that, but the writing is way off. The jokes are more about being random than fitting with what the characters have been since the show started. The show is more overt about the moral of story too, which feels preachy and out of character for the Belchers. Being preachy isn't a bad thing necessarily, but in this case the point of the show is absurd comedy. It is supposed to make you laugh. When you are sacrificing laughs to send a message, then you are changing the entire point of the show. I recommend watching the first 9-10 seasons if you like to laugh."
Previous seasons were great funny and enjoyable. Last season was too crass and too much potty humor. Gene is not even funny and Louise has become annoying. Clear sign of a show that's ran its course.
"One of the funniest and best characters and best storytelling.

A+"
"This is by far my favourite animated comedy series, I think it's much funnier than Family Guy, that's coming from a FG fan as well. This is so funny to watch, if you're ever in a rubbish mood this is sure to bring you right back up. I used to watch this on YouTube live stream sometimes I find myself back there more often recently than before, its a constant live stream that never ends, you could go watch it right now.

Without spoiling thes show this is basically a family running a family owned burger joint, that and all the chaos that comes with running a business with your wife and 3 children, the humour in this show is on another level, its actually insane how much this makes me laugh.

Very entertaining show that is worth the watch, is it bingeworthy? Yes!"
"While I don't find this as good as ""Rick And Morty"" or even H. Jon Benjamin's other show ""Archer"", this is still a lot of fun. I really do find the animation funny. The creator has stated that yes, the character designs were in fact inspired by the Muppets. The funniest thing is that I find myself singing the intro to ""The Muppet Show"" when I see the theme song to this. The story is as basic as it can be, with a guy named Bob running a restaurant named after his burgers. The biggest appeal to this is probably how authentic it is. Despite the fact that the animation is goofy, it comes off as very realistic and the characters do behave like real people. The voice acting is wonderful in this.

Every character has a distinct voice that matches their personality perfectly. It's pretty funny to hear Tina when she's trying to be angry or some other emotion. I simply can not speak ill of anything Kristen Schaal. ""Gravity Falls"" may be over, but may that voice live on forever with Louise...or at least until this show ends as well. It's hard to pick a favorite character because they are all so funny. Gene is probably the most entertaining, although Louise might be the most eccentric. I just love the idea of a character like Tina who writes fanfics in-universe of her favorite things. It's especially funny because of all the porn she makes. Yes, a perfect reflection of fandom indeed.

The episodes are really quite unpredictable and there's always some new real life adventure these funny characters are getting into. I think my favorite episode might be the one with the mechanical shark. It's just hilarious to see this thing get more powerful as they try to stop it. I like Tina's Romeo and Juliet-esque relationship with Jimmy Junior. Yes, I'm a brony too. I'm just going to reference every other cartoon in existence in this review, aren't I? I will complain about how ""King Of The Hill"" can be boring as a slice of life story but this is just a lot funnier with better characters who are always saying funny things and actively getting into some new predicament.

I'm impressed at how they have yet to have any supernatural elements introduced as almost every show has at least one paranormal episode or magic realism. Well, they might share a Universe with ""Archer"" which had some unrealistic stuff, but then again that could have just been a non canonical joke, kind of like when Bob had a cameo in that ""Family Guy""/""The Simpsons"" crossover. Man, degrees of separation are weird. ***1/2."
"Bob's Burgers is a pretty funny show, it has a lot of references to pop culture. However, it is a mature show and definitely shouldn't be viewed by children younger than 12. The language is fairly mild, but some situations and references might be questionable. The animation is very crisp and the voice work is really good.

H. Jon Benjamin, the voice of Bob Belcher might be familiar to you if you've seen Family Guy or Archer; as he's in both. Kevin Kline does the voice of Mr. Fischoeder, also a great play on words. One of the funnier characters is Teddy, the number one customer at Bob's Burgers. He has some great moments himself and sometimes steals the scenes.

A great modern comedy show. The holiday episodes, especially the Thanksgiving episodes are some of th best. Bob Appetite!"
"Love this show. One of the funniest and most relatable. Nothing rude, just simple funny, family humor. I watch it with my kids and they love it also. Hope they keep making more seasons honestly. Thank you Fox"
"With new Simpsons and Family Guy episodes failing to entertain less and less with every new episode, Bob's Burgers was a glimmering light at the end of what to me, was a dark, unfunny tunnel. On it's premiere night I decide to check it out because there wasn't to much on, and since then I have been a complete fan of the show. The plot revolves around a man and his struggling burger joint run by him, his wife and his 3 children. The premise may seem a little ""closed"" but I hope that they are able to continue it for long enough that it doesn't get boring and ridiculous, but with what they've shown so far it does not appear that they are slowing down with quirky, and original plots. The show is hilarious and the actors that voice them are perfect. I've shown this to all my room mates and everyone has become a fan, so hopefully this show will be on the air for a while."
Honestly this show took some getting used to because my wife really enjoyed it but I never paid attention when she had it on. But eventually Bob and his family really grew on me as characters and I found myself laughing at the awkward and depressing scenerios they got themselves into in every episode. Not only was the blue collar lifestyle he lived so relatable but something about this show's comedy never felt too over the edge like family guy or rick and morty get. I still dont throw this show on repeat like I have either one of those other animated comedies but its still worth watching the whole way through with a loved one or friend that enjoys adult animation!
"The simple fact that Kevin Kline is involved, should be enough for anyone to understand the caliber of this series. The entire cast playing the Belchers is spot on and only gets better with each episode. This show has a new and fresh vibe to it, but also has a certain familiar attribute; a family trying to do the best that they can with what they have and having a little fun along the way. A surprisingly exceptional character is found in Louise, played by Kristen Schaal. While all the characters have redeeming qualities of their own, Louise's character is in my opinion one of the most exuberantly funny. She is the comic relief more often than not. Each episode takes you on a new adventure, theme, idea, premise, etc.. Lots of variety keeps the show interesting. Overall- Outstanding series, but could use more of Regular Sized Rudy."
"I'm going to keep this short. This show has no potential to make it for an entire season, and yet I wish it would. All it is, is a show about a guy and his family who own a burger shop (As you can tell in the commercials). The comedy is extremely dry, the main voices are all male (even for the womens roles), and the artwork will make some people sick. But, I watched the entire show laughing all the time. I am certainly going to be watching this show again if not mainly for the voice of H. Jon Benjamin. He's the voice of the movie buff in family guy who always talks with Chris about random boob shots. His voice was so impeccably perfect for this off-beat comedy that I can do nothing but laugh at him and his supporting cast. If you have some time, give this show a shot, especially since it won't last long."
"After all the hype for the last two months, I was expecting something worth watching (at least). What a disappointment! I can't believe that FOX believes that this steaming pile of manure has any business being on their network. Of course, this is the same network that cancelled Futurama so maybe it isn't actually so hard to understand after all.

The storyline and situations are juvenile and totally asinine, the writing is childish and the animation makes South Park look absolutely high tech.

I wasted a half hour of my life watching this drivel - I won't make that mistake again."
"I have absolutely loved The Umbrella Academy ever since the very first episode. I even enjoyed this last season (s3) a lot more than most. It's unlike any other superhero type show there is. It's just such an original and unique show. It has everything you want in a good show...action, drama, comedy, suspense, twists, etc. It will keep you on the edge of your seat throughout the series! Every character is so well written, they all have superhero powers but also real life problems that they all have to deal with both individually and as a family. It's too bad that this last season (s4) was so bad. I liked the first 3 seasons so much and was looking forward to this ending and what we got was extremely disappointing. The entire season was a mess, especially the ending."
"The Umbrella Academy is such an incredible show that really should be entertaining to all types of different people! I would absolutely recommend it to any superhero fan, action fan, sci-fi fan or drama fan because it has something for fans of all those genres! It may start a little slow for some while it builds up the story and characters, but it gets better and better as the story progresses. The first 3 seasons were all amazing, I can say there's very little drop in quality in those seasons but this last season feels rushed (even though they had 2yrs to get it done)! I may be a little biased because I'm such a huge fan of superhero movies/shows and while I have to say The Umbrella Academy isn't my absolute favorite one, it's still really good and very entertaining! It really brings a fresh take to the genre and has something that everyone can enjoy."
"Season 1 and 2 are Incredibly entertaining, wildly inventive, and full of complex characters with a fresh new idea in a world of superhero content, by providing something deeper and more personal than most superhero content dares to attempt. His casting is amazing. The show is also excellently shot, notably its cinematography during its action sequences. Its writing and directing is often on point, inciteful at times, and the show is also full of delightful twists that kept me more than interested as the show went on. Besides all these excellent traits, The Umbrella Academy also has a fantastic soundtrack and a wonderfully nostalgic attitude that will keep you entertained all the way through.

If the show had ended in 2020 with his season 2, it would have been one of the best Netflix series, but the show kept going and the 2 next seasons are so bad that i will never watch them again in my life. The characters were butchered, the plot was so boring and stupid. CGI became horrible. No more budget. I didn't even cared for the characters anymore while i loved them so much in S1/S2. There is so many problems with S3 and S4 that i can't list them all. All i know is that you will have horrible time watching those awfuls seasons..."
"Very entertaining series about superheroes, where superheroes have a life, a character, dramas and traumas... But what in my opinion raises it above the already good series is the use of music in the movie. Remarkable, impressive, needs to recognized with an award. It's been years (pulp fiction?) since I saw such a perfect use of music for the last time!"
It rarely happens in series that the second season is better than the first.
"Adrian Gallagher, Five, is a genuine standout for his acting in a series which is largely plagued by a storyline with rampant plot holes.

The writers had an initial idea that seemed to work but the series just never really comes together or finds a way to keep me truly interested. The plot drags on and the way they attempt to wrap up certain parts of the story is increasingly unsatisfying.

7/10 - Writing is just falling flat while, Five, is carrying the series on his back. Help the dude out."
Robert Sheehan as Klaus for me is the best thing about this show. Overall it got better as it went on. Looking forward to a new season.
"Since season 1 the UA is the kind of series you often want to stop watching because you ask yourself ""what is this nonsense"", with the plot going in so different directions and twists and unpleasant situations...yet somehow the series manages to keep us hooked, and there are several reasons: 1- A very original story 2- Remarkable visual effects 3- This should be the number one reason, it is actually the characters, the members of the ""family"": Each personality is so well conveyed, with its own ticks and mannerisms, it is so difficult to pinpoint which actor or actress is the best, each performance is so well studied and so naturally and spontaneously played out, even the ""father"" who is given more space in the final season, so it will be only fair that this ""ensemble"" cast gets all the rewards in this category, they deserve it high and loud.

I won't reveal what happens in the final episode, but it does ""deliver"" on a high level, both emotionally and visually, and indeed spectacularly ! Go for it, it is not often that we witness a small screen production of this quality ! Nine stars !"
"A lot of the show would be solved if characters would just communicate with each other and ask each other questions, but they refuse to time and time again, even 3 seasons in, leading to easy to fix problems not being solved till the end.

Its just lazy writing, instead of solving problems by at least having a bit of communication and then creating new and interesting problems after, the writers decided to drag easy to solve problems throughout a whole season and then justify it by labelling the characters/family as dysfunctional.

It is so frustrating to watch, but at the same time, aside from the problems, there are still many entertaining moments, fights, and funny dialogue within scenes so I gave it a 6."
"The show started so good with season 1 and 2, but like every other show or movie that explores time travel, timelines and multiverses, it's easy to get lost along the way. After so many changes, plot lines, characters dying and coming back alive, losing or gaining powers, it really starts to look like nothing makes sense anymore. Yet, I had some hopes for last season. Having watched the whole thing I have to say I'm really disappointed and genuinely sad. Every once in a while I watch shows that start good and finish bad, and I usually still recommend them cause the good in the beginning is ""worth it"", but this is not the case. The last season is a total mess, writers seem to have gotten lost in the complications of all the plotlines and totally forgot what the show was really about. The plotlines made no sense, the main plotline had no explanation, they did ALL the characters so dirty, they left many (important) questions unanswered, and the finale felt so disconnected to the start of the story. To all honestly, right now I'm grieving a show that had so much potencial and just ended in the worst possible way."
"Such a great series, wonderful storylines, great characters, amazing acting, and filmed in Canada! Just finished the final season, and so sad to have to say goodbye to these characters. Fantastic final season, and love the timeline stuff. Five's hubristic attitude has always made me chuckle, especially as the ""youngest"" yet ""oldest"" of the group. It was nice to see his softer underbelly this season. If only Aiden Gallagher was a little older...sigh ;) Robert Sheehan as Klaus also never fails to entertain. Such a great character it must be to play! Elliott Page is an amazing talent, and never disappoints. I love the way the writers on the show did the Vanya/Viktor transition. What a beautiful, supportive family moment. The entire cast has great chemistry, and is thoroughly enjoyable to watch. Thanks for a great show, Netflix, and I hope you find more stories like these!"
"Watching through the four seasons gives quite the time stamp on comic book adaptations. The first season was more grounded, gritty and serious, much like early comic book adaptations throught the 2000's and early 2010's. From season 2 onwards, however, the series honours the comic book's sillyness and outlandish plots and characters, much like modern comic book adaptations do, and seeing it play out is a wonderful passage of time.

The characters, much like in the comics and even from the start, are a dysfunctional family that cause as many problems for themselves and they save themselves. Yet their powers and sometimes personalities are different, making them stand out on their own even if they allude to the comics.

The special effects are always competently made, especially as the aforementioned shift towards the more outlandish.

Overall a solid recommendation for character piece and just general comic book fun."
Really enjoyed this show but the last season completely felt out of sync with the whole show. Ended in such a dumb way. It had potential but this seemed like a huge after thought. None of the characters except for Claude seemed like themselves. It's so sad they have so much trouble ending these shows on a good note. This season while it has some interesting parts there was so much missing and most of the characters did nothing. Why so short also. Getting really tired of these 6 episode season where the writing is crap and nothing happens and it's called a season much less a series finally. Blah.
"First episode is a little slow, but after that it just keeps coming at you until all that's left are the credits of episode 10. The sound track is fantastic, acting on point, story line brilliantly executed. Can't wait for more!"
"I'm sitting here in the dark after watching the last episode with a warm feeling in my heart and tears in my eyes. Thank you for taking us on this journey. I will remember it for the rest of my life.

Best regards, Simon J."
"Mr. Robot simply changed my life.

I watched over 4175 TV episodes of 92 shows (28 still in production). But the last episode (mostly the last 3 eps) of this masterpiece just broke my heart. I was never so sentimental for characters in any movie. But this time it was like taking place of the action, feeling the anger, the shame, the frustration of Eliot. After watching so much TV, you notice they tend to have similar patterns, similar endings, but not, no. This mind****** me. The only thing that I want more is that I want more of this!

Hats off for Mr. Rami Malek for converting acting into feelings to this level. And thanks to Sam Esmail for being the architect of this masterpiece!

I bow to you!

Thank you."
"I've loved all 4 seasons of Mr Robot but 1 and 4 are definitely the best of the bunch.

Season 4 has been an epic journey so far. The only downside is waiting a week to find out what happens next. Once it's finished i'll be bingeing it all again.

Rami Malek is brilliant as are the rest of the cast.

10/10"
It's a huge shame that a series like The Walking dead has a higher rate
"Over the final 3 episodes I've had my mouth open the entire time. There's nothing that exceeds this. I don't know what to say. Watch this god damn show.

10/10."
S4 E7 best off the best on the tv I have ever been seen
"One of my favorite tv series! Incredibly well written, directed acted, with a great soundtrack. Emotional and interesting throughout all seasons, full of plot twists, difficult choices and hardships."
"This is one of the most unique show I have seen on Tv, if you are intrigued by the first episode you will probably fall in love with the rest of the show. The plot is top-notch and it is very suspenseful, it features some of the best tv characters ever, every actors nails their role. This show also features heavy amount of Hacking, I thought that was very neat and cool, but do not expect to see too much of that aspect, the focal point of this show is really the story. Definitely a 10 out of 10 for this one."
"I am very interested to see where this show will go. The person who left a 1/10 rating must not like technology/hacking/etc themed stuff (why did they watch it in the first place then!). I loved it. Hints of fight club/conspiracy theory stuff, but not too over the top. Overall, I love the sense of mystery coupled with the tech stuff, and will definitely be watching this one religiously. If you are at all into technology, especially the underworld of technology ie hacking, you will like this. If you like stuff that underlines the insanity of our dollar-based culture, elite basking in money while the poor suffer etc, you will like this show. Just watch it. It's good."
"Well after season 1,2 and 3 I tho this show couldn't play anymore tricks with my brain but after season 4 episode 11 I am once again paralyzed and unable to fall asleep."
"This show is brilliant. I rebuilt a friendship over having to discuss this show. True sci-fi. The tech is cutting edge and accurate. The world/universe building is incredible. And an interesting and uncomfortable social commentary.

I can't really say much else other people haven't said: brilliant acting, well written, uses the entire medium brilliantly, using all kinds of visual and sound cues, so when twists are revealed you suddenly realize the information was there all along.

I binged watched the entire thing before the last season. It doesn't quite reach the enraging level of disappointment that ""Lost"" reached, but last episode left me with the feeling, ""Oh, well, nevermind."""
"When I watched the first episode i was feeling kind of skeptical and i forced my self to continue watching... i am glad i did.that The performance of the characters is beyond brilliant and the plot is very intelligent and requires the viewer to be attentive every minute in order to understand. What is also enthralling about this show is it keeps on surprising you, so whenever i felt it was getting dull something mind-blowing happens and flips the plot! I remember i almost cried in quiet few scenes in season 3!I think this show should receive more attention and credit than it has and i truly hope they do not ruin it in season 4."
"Everything having to do with going against society and conspiracies I crave! Mr. Robot is incredibly filmed, written, and has such an exciting soundtrack! I absolutely love the vibes I get from all the excellent things that happen throughout. Some of the best suspense ever and profound quotes/speeches. Rami Malek has become one of my favorite actors to watch and I have enjoyed Christian Slater quite a lot. I can't wait till I can own season 4 like I own the other seasons."
I love watching this show. It is a true entertaining show. The story is very wonderful and has many layers of action and thriller. It is just awesome show with wonderful and powerful dialogues.
How this is show is just 8.5 overall rating when only 2 or 3 epsoides in the 4 seasons are only below 8.5 and more than half epsoides are above 9 someone give me a clue
"Wow, I started watching first episode and was skeptical. Those type of shows about hackers and conspiracy are not my favorite. But I loved the first episode, it is well done, acting is amazing however it seems to be going too fast. It seems they have too many ideas and only show us a little bit. The first episode had just over an hour, yet so much happened in it that it could easily be split into 2-3 episodes. But at least it is not boring. It also seems real. And they use command tool for hacking, not one of those super spy CIA graphical interface that you just have to press ""HACK"" and you are hacker .. oh how I hate those. I am not saying this is the way hacking works, but it does seem closer to the real thing more than dumb Hollywood movies. I watch many TV shows and this one really got my attention. Highly recommended."
"I was there when the pilot aired. I loved it since day 1. Season 4 is the best!!! Sam Esmail is a genius. Rami , Christian and all of the cast are amazing. This show is going to end with a bang. I bet the finale will be the highest rated one in tv history. And Rami is definitely going to win his Golden Globe this year too!"
"Huh. I always whine about lack of realism - especially anything computer-related in movies.

Mr. Robot does hacking really, really well. Of course, it's sped up and Hollywood-magic-added, but it's a staple how they should do it in movies, now and forever. We never see the characters actually write any of those million Python scripts, but that's probably for the better. Hacking really feels like hacking.

Which is a really good thing, if your show is about hacking. But Mr. Robot is not about hacking. Some would say that Mr. Robot is about mental disorder. Which it tries to portray itself as. But Mr. Robot is not about mental disorder, neither. Mr. Robot is a social experiment called ""how long until fans will see through our bs and quit?"".

Similar, and arguably better experiment of this sort already exists, and it's a TV-show called ""Lost"". A show that just adds and adds layer of coating the more you try to see what's actually inside.

Mr. Robot does the same thing, but it lacks the exotic locations, suspenseful moments, deep mysteries and strong cast of ""Lost"". Sure, Rami Malek plays well, and so does supporting cast and Portia Doubleday probably ruined sleep of nerds worldwide, but it's still not ""Lost"". And I hated ""Lost"". And if ""Lost"" had one f-you-it's-all-a-dream disappointment, Mr. Robot does it constantly, again and again, building it up over many episodes, before exploding it all over your face. I can almost hear the director giggling like a naughty teenager.

If you take all this crap layer away, underneath is a quite poor and poorly-thought-out hacker story of a guy why took on world finance and a megacorporation while not understanding jack about money or finance, and ruined lives of millions by that. Even the big ""final, redeeming hack"" probably crashed world markets again and caused insane inflation (luckily, the show just ends at that point, so this misery is not shown).

It's a power fantasy of a 12-year old computer (or an A/V) club geek, and even though characters are lovely and try hard, it's sadly still all it is, with all the limitations and disappointment that come with it."
"Mr. Robot Staring Rami Malek, Christian Slater, and Portia Doubleday is a work of art. While telling the story of a hard working, slightly struggling cyber engineer with a hard drug addiction; it also depicts a realistic representation of how ""our democracy has been hacked."" It is also a very realistic life story with quotes like, ""I should just tell her what she wants to hear,"" and, ""We're all living in each other's paranoia."" A must watch for all. There is no better role of Rami Malek than of Mr. Robot's Elliot Alderson."
"Boardwalk Empire is one of the best shows I've ever seen. The acting and writing are as good as anything you'll see on tv. The production is also fantastic, the attention to detail is just incredible. It tells the story of Atlantic City politician/gangster, Enoch ""Nucky"" Thompson (Steve Buscemi), and how he runs the town both legally and criminally. He runs it with his brother Elias (Shea Whigham), who is also the Sheriff, and their gang of tough guys. It takes place during prohibition and Nucky is the #1 distributor of illegal alcohol. He does this while doing business with some of the most notorious gangsters in American history like Al Capone, Lucky Luciano, Jim Colosimo, Arnold Rothstein, among others. There's not much I can say that hasn't already been said about this incredible show so just go watch it. You won't be disappointed!"
"Boardwalk Empire is absolutely, without a doubt one the best gangster shows ever created. Every season is as addictive as the last. Steve Buscemi leads an amazing cast as he gives one of the best performances ever put on tv! This is tv at its best so don't miss it!"
Terrific from start to finish. Can't say enough about how entertaining this show is.
"This show has to be one of my personal favourites, I would always recommend people to check out. In terms of the show itself, you've got an awesome cast of great actors, with some the most beautiful cinematography, and hands down the story is just fantastic. You've got historical true elements mixed of course with fictional aspects, more so on the fictional side but it's just amazing to see these actors play out some the most iconic historic mobsters, Stephen Graham as Al Capone is just amazing, one my top favourite actors to see on screen. And ultimately one the best endings to a show, with no spoilers the story comes full circle, with a satisfying end."
"At first when I started this series, I thought it would be just another typical gangster TV show with not much of a plot or well developed characters. However, season 3 onward, the show really grew on me.

The overall story arcs I found really engaging and interesting. You weren't just watching one gangster shoot another gangster, you were watching characters you cared about get into interesting and varied predicaments. Though each season was often slow at the start, though I didn't mind this personally, the way they built up to the finales was fantastic, not a single one disappointed.

The characters were also really well developed. Again unlike your typical gangster flick, where you like the characters because of the stealing and murdering and racketeering they get into, in Boardwalk Empire you actually get the sense that the mob bosses are real people with real motivations. This is best seen in Nucky Thomson but also with others, though in Al Capone's case I found he got crueller, nastier and less humorous as the seasons went by.

The setting and cinematography was also great, helped by the show's choice of music. Previously, I'd never thought of Atlantic City as much of a place, being an Englishman, but by the end I felt like I had gotten to no and love it. Overall, a great TV show which I would think is suited to quite a wide audience, not gangster film fans."
"This show is loaded with excellent acting and writing!!!!! It's worth watching every minute and shot. Steve Buscemi definitely deserves an Emmy for his portrayal of ""Nucky."" I haven't enjoyed a show from HBO this much since ""Deadwood."" The characters are well layered and the dialogue is fantastic. The supporting cast is immensely talented and the scenery is simply gorgeous. Michael Pitt is a pleasure to watch in his, complex role of the war hero gone bad. I hope this show lasts a lot longer than ""Deadwood"" did and makes household names out of its cast. I'll keep my HBO subscription forever if more shows like these are on the horizon."
"I have never written a review on iMDb. I have never given a TV show a straight 10/10 before. No other ending has ever left me in the total shock that this ending left me. Apart from a very few exceptions (e.g. The Sopranos, Breaking Bad), no other show has done such a phenomenal job at character development. The music, the atmosphere, the (historical) characters are simply spectacular. Pretty much all the characters are extremely memorable, since the viewer gets really, and I mean, REALLY invested into their entire personality, their dreams, their fears, their yearnings, their aspirations. Do yourself a favor and start watching this masterpiece right away."
"It was nearly perfect. I feel like the final season was a little unnecessary but they made it work. Richard Harrow is probably my favourite character from anything ever and I know they think they used him just enough but they could have featured him just a little more.

I feel sorry for everyone who says they stopped watching after season 2."
This show is amazing all around such great acting and story line. It's one of those shows that needs time to set things up so if it seems slow and confusing at first try and stick it out. I love seeing all these big time crime syndicates come up and thru the ranks. The way they can transform a set back 100 years with such precision and accuracy is astounding to me. Sopranos is my favorite show ever and you'll see a lot of these actors and actresses in this series.
"The writing, acting, music, historical events. It's all there. Then you have Martin Scorsese involved, so what can go wrong?"
I just recently finished binging this show and I've gotta say I don't know what took me so long to watch. It's an amazing show with great characters and as a history buff I really enjoyed how they incorporated real life people into the story. Beautiful settings and costume designs as well. For anyone who hasn't yet watched this do yourself a favor and start now.
"Season 3 was excellent, mainly due to gyp Rossetti. It is a very good series, but is too drawn out and slow a lot of the time."
"since first episode it was pretty much what i expected; great re-enactments of 1920's America (including the excessive use of stereotypes unfortunately, with a superficial originality ), an appropriate soundtrack for the era, excellent camera direction, and decent to good actors (a few played too over the top such as Capone character ).

but after watching season 2 entirely i will surly give up on it. my problem is that the writers are going after ""The Godfather Effect"" with cheap melodramatic thrills all in the name of so called realism...characters are multidimensional (most have likable/dis likable traits) but season 1 is all over the place with the same message given over and over: ""America was a much more ruthless place than it is today, with everyone unscrupulous, driven by almighty dollar..."". Meanwhile season 2 starts rather better off but derails off track and in the last 2 episodes there was so much predictability when expecting the twist.

my point i try make is that the serial becomes UN-entertaining fast. after the season 2 finale especially, i really can not care less for any of the ""players"" LEFT in play... for such ""realism"" i will just call my local politician or read the newspaper between the lines, i don't need waste time watch a fantasy that claims to be realistic (oxymoron at best).

it is a much too materialistic show for my taste (capitalism at its finest...right...) with very little if any educative content besides the costumes and appliances used on sets)."
"With production values that are mind-boggling, cast, and a budget to die for HBO is now what film studios were in the 1930s, they have the clout and the ability to go way further than most films can - and you get episode after episode.

the detailing is beyond accurate and lavish - every stitch, every furnishing, every telegraph wire looks and feels authentic and it is all shot and lit to the highest standards of film not TV.

The story of prohibition and Atlantic City is fully detailed, complex, with Steve Buscemi heading up a great cast. I have a gripe that the F-word was not ubiquitous at the time and strikes a jarring note in an otherwise near perfect production.

Where this shines is in the details - I just hope the story lines and acting live up to the promise - they certainly have so far."
"As an avid Sopranos fan, and generally a fan of anything gangster-related, I was always going to gravitate towards a show like this. It's 'that' show which always seems to be left out of the 'Greatest TV Shows of All Time' discussions, and it's baffling as to why that happens. For me, it's up there with The Sopranos, Breaking Bad, The Wire, and others we're so much more familiar with.

The casting is fantastic, the sets are incredible, and the writing is multi-layered and keeps you really involved with each character's story. I recently shared this show with my current girlfriend who stated right away ""I can't stand Nelson Van Alden, he's so boring"", and all I said was ""just wait...you'll change your mind"", and change her mind she did. His story arc in particular is just incredible, but that's about 1% of the full picture - it's just an amazing piece of television and probably still my second-favourite show post-Sopranos, with number one being Breaking Bad.

Watch it - seriously."
"Starts off great as you learn about the corruption spreading as prohibition takes off. It's a story of morality and it doesn't have a happy ending.

You're reminded this an HBO show that loosely follows real life historical figures through the rise of organized crime and the forces trying to stop them.

The later seasons start to get a bit tired and boring, but it has a strong ending."
"The show doesn't need any introduction and neither does the cast. It encompasses a generation where the political landscape is much the same as today but it is laced with more violence, sexism and corruption and in the midst is a thriving business of illegal alcohol.

A new standard is set with the storytelling, cinematography, elaborate sets on the shores of Brooklyn, carefully chosen custom tailored clothes and costumes that match the opulent lifestyles of the characters. The occasional inserts of magazines, books, manuals; all in their original form, which not only gives originality (to the show) for the era that is being depicted but also takes you back in time into the deeply woven lives of characters like Mrs Schroeder, Nucky, Eli, Nelson and my personal favorite character Mr. Kessler.

A barrage of other prominent real life characters like Arnold Rothstein, Lucky Liciano, Al Capone, (Jimmy Darmody?), Johnny Torrio, Senators, Congressmen, President and VP contenders make the show complete and give it a political as well as a mob dimension.

Much of what is in the show is based on true events and a cursory search on Wikipedia on some of the famous characters validates it. This is what makes this brilliant show dark just like it's setting - theme song with clouds over Atlantic city.

One of the less talked about part of the show perhaps are the melodious songs that the producers/writers have decided for the background score. The songs fill up the environment with melancholy just like much of the show and leaves us eagerly waiting for the next episode.

Any less than ten stars for the show would only reflect lack of fine taste."
"There has never been a mob/mafia film like this one, and there never will be again. Phenomenal writing, dialogue, acting, directing, photography--the works. I only give the series a 9 because many of the sex scenes, and much of the profanity, could have been left out and the story would not have suffered at all. Ultra-violent, authentic dialogue from that era, and touching in many parts."
A must watch series Brilliant acting and story. Thought ending was slightly rushed
"You know it is going to be good when it is produced by Martin Scorcese and starred by Steve Buscemi.

The directing and writting are incredible, it never looses quality and you know that no matter who gets wacked it never fills like something is missing.

It isn't as good as The Sopranos, though. Both shows have their slow moments/episodes, but the comic side of The Sopranos and the funny acting of James Gandolfini makes the show more entertaining.

Still, another incredible success from HBO."
"Greetings from Lithuania.

What a wonderful pilot!

First i read some reviews before watching pilot, and they where saying how ""boooring"" this episode was. Hell no! That was one of the best pilots in a ... ever! When you have screenwriter of ""Sopranos"" and Mr. M.Scorsese in a director chair - nothing can go wrong! A pilot of ""Boardwalk Empire"" reminded my of ""Goodfellas"", ""Sopranos"" (i read that behind this show is a writer of ""Sopranos"" after watching pilot) and ... ""Departed"" - it's was THAT good.

If this show will live up to the pilot - we have a new Emmy winner in all possible categories.

Watch it and don't wary about negative reviews - this is a really great show."
"The show is good, but there was something lacking in the characters, and the story. Some were awful, some were ok, and some were good. Which was kind of surprising, for an HBO show. One thing for sure, the show lacked the lovable ""bad guy"", that you had in shows like The Sopranos(Toni, Paulie), or Deadwood(Al). The one who's bad, but the character is so good, you couldn't help but love them. I assume it was supposed to be Nucky, but almost no one in this show fits that role, the closest, was maybe Al. I didn't feel character connection, and without spoiling anything, some of the major characters, fell very flat for me. I found myself wanting to rush through seasons, not because the typical, "" Oh, I have to watch just one more"". It was more like I just wanted to get it over with. Is it worth watching? Yes. Is it worth buying, or even watching through a second time? Not in my opinion. This doesn't hold up like other HBO shows that I can randomly go back through, and rewatch every once in a while. I think this one would fall pretty far down on the list, if you were ranking HBO shows."
"A stinker. An immaculately crafted stinker but a stinker all the same. People talk about the period detail and historical accuracy as if that equals good TV. For those of you that didn't know, this isn't a documentary or a recreation. Boardwalk Empire is a work of fiction. Those irrelevancies aren't what makes me dislike this show though. Although it is amusing that a series which puts such a high value on realism contains such unrealistic violence and melodrama. My problem is that the storyline is mind numbingly slow paced and dull. Hardly anything happens and when it finally does it carries little to no impact because I have been bored into a waking sleep waiting for it to happen.

Everybody's screwing everybody, everybody's down each others pants and up each others skirts, oh it's so ambiguous. Get over it, it's been done, before and better and cos this is TV and something worked once lets do it until everyone's so sick of it we'll never do it again...until we run out of ideas that is. Just check Kelsey Grammar in Boss and a plethora of others for this 'he's not good or bad he just is' characterisation. Darmody is the only character I care about and he's not in it enough. Ambiguity is good, people make mistakes, shades of grey blah blah but can you seriously say you are rooting for Nucky?

Lead characters have to be at least kinda likable. The lead character in this piece is a villain operating for money and power with no redeeming qualities. Tony Soprano was a dedicated family man. Bill Adama fervently cared for the survival of his fleet. Why doesn't Nucky take his money and retire somewhere good instead of staying in that damp, drab, grey wasteland he calls home. What's his motivation? Why should I want him to succeed?

I would rather a show shot on a sound stage with cardboard sets and a great story than a show with a $500m budget and a boring one. I think the praise and accolades Boardwalk Empire has gained are based on the name power of Scorsese, Buscemi and HBO. Over time this series will not be mentioned in the same breath as The Sopranos or Deadwood. Don't believe the hype. Get off the bandwagon."
"I am not a big TV lover. Mostly I watch South Park, but this show has gotten me interested in more live-action shows. It tells its stories with the same quality as a normal theater film for each episode making it feel like a massive crime drama experience. I have been waiting for a while now to review it, and now that the first season is over I can make my honest opinion clear. I live on a barrier island in New Jersey named Long Beach Island. It is about an hour drive away from Atlantic City so as you can guess I've been there a few times. My favorite part about Atlantic City is the boardwalk. Since this show is named Boardwalk Empire it should do a good job at showing what it looked like back in the 20's. Simply put it captures the 20's perfectly. The show is directed so well I felt like I was transported back to those days. They also capture the feel of the 20's in other ways by showing historic events such as the World Series scam. In the end though it best captures the spirit of the 20's on the boardwalk. As for the plot it is set in the 1920's. Prohabition has begun starting a whole decade of illegal alcohol smuggling. The Treasurer of Atlantic City Nucky Thompson is starting a smuggling business that results in some bloody consequences. Along the way he meets a woman named Mrs. Schroeder, deals with an oncoming election, and more. It is a very well told story. It manages to tell several different stories throughout the show, but none of them feel underdone. They all are extremely well put together story lines. You have the main alcohol smuggling story, the story of Nucky and Margaret, the story of Jimmy, the story of Capone, the story of Lucky, the story of Eli Thompson, the story of Agent Nelson Van Alden, and many more. All these different stories keep things fresh. The emotions that are shown in the episodes are powerful. As the episodes go on emotions get stronger like layers of an onion. Something that is also present in this show is flare. Every gangster flick needs that style to it. It needs to have that gangster feel. While this show doesn't have a lot of that when it happens it is really cool. Now I end this review on the acting. Everybody does a swell job. Buscemi is great as usual, and everyone else is great. The person who I'm most interested in is Michael Pitt who is a relatively unknown actor, but here is great and I would like to see him other things. He could make it real big. Overall I love this show. I will be a viewer of the next season for sure."
"I love this series so much. I like the characters, how they interact with each other and just the plot alone. This is pure genius. Going on adventures with the crew and having a bit of humor along the way. The acting is supreme and the soundtrack is nice too. I ❤ this series very much and can only recommend it !"
"Nearly twenty years after the original Star Trek was cancelled by NBC, Gene Roddenberry and Paramount sought to capitalize on the enormous success of TOS in syndication and on the big screen. Roddenberry decided to make the new series with few connections to the original, so that it could stand on its own. Many fans didn't like the idea of new characters, but Roddenberry pressed ahead, and Star Trek: The Next Generation was born. British stage actor Patrick Stewart assumed the role of Frenchman Captain Jean-Luc Picard, bringing gravitas, phenomenal acting skills, and an English accent that would become the boon of many jokes; Jonathon Frakes became William T. Riker, the Kirk-esque ""Number One"" with a love for the ladies and jazz; Brent Spiner was cast as Data, the android who envied human emotion; Gates McFadden was Dr. Beverly Crusher, the CMO with a complicated past with Captain Picard; Wil Wheaton was her irritating son Wesley, who would long annoy the fans; Michael Dorn brought a distinct presence to the recurring role of Klingon officer Worf, so much that he was promoted to regular. Marina Sirtis looked good as Deanna Troi, the psychiatrist who had once been involved with Riker; LeVar Burton was cast as Geordi LaForge, the blind Conn Officer; finally, Denise Crosby was Security Chief Tasha Yar. Also in the pilot was an unnamed conn officer played by Colm Meaney, who would later become Transporter Chief Miles O'Brien.

The first two seasons were of average quality, but they did a good job of setting up the characters and expanding the Trek universe. The series gathered its own following, although it continued to exist in the shadow of TOS. Q became an ongoing presence, appearing twice more after the pilot. His third appearance had him introducing the crew to the Borg, the fearsome cyborgs who would become Trek's most famous villains. Denise Crosby left TNG near the end of the first year, saying that her character wasn't being given enough to do. The producers also removed Gates McFadden's Dr. Crusher, introducing Dr. Kate Pulaski (Diana Muldaur) to induce more conflict. The fans did not take to Pulaski, so McFadden was brought back for the start of Season Three. That season was when TNG really came into its own, ending with the reappearance of the Borg. The Borg abducted Captain Picard, and turned him into one of them; Riker, now in command, gave the order to destroy the Borg Cube, while Picard was still onboard. That was the greatest cliffhanger in TV history, and TNG received a great deal of media attention as a result. Droves of new viewers tuned in for the fourth season premiere, which many perceived as a bit of a letdown after all the hype; but the viewers stayed, and TNG soared in the ratings, producing more and more quality episodes. While it did lose a bit of steam in its final year, it finished with an incredible series finale, All Good Things..., and then launched a movie franchise of its own.

TNG Top Ten Episodes: Conundrum; The Next Phase; Data's Day; The Best of Both World Parts I & II; Redemption Parts I & II; Reunion; The Defector; Face of the Enemy; The Pegasus; Elementary, My Dear Data;"
"When the TNG series premiered in 1987, it wasn't greeted well by many of the old-time Trek fans, including myself. It didn't help matters that one of the earliest episodes, ""The Naked Now"" was a superficial retread of the classic ""The Naked Time"" from '66. The new episode should have served as a way of spotlighting several of the new crew, but all it did was show them all in heat. I wasn't too impressed. What did work was keeping the central theme of exploration (something lost in the offshoots, DS9 & Voyager). The new Enterprise was twice as large as the original, with about a thousand personnel aboard. Capt. Picard (Stewart) was a more cerebral, diplomatic version of the ultimate explorer we had known as Capt. Kirk. Again, Picard wasn't too impressive in the first two awkward seasons, as some may mistake his caution for weakness. The Kirk-like first officer Riker (Frakes) was controlled by Picard, so the entire crew of Enterprise-D came across as a bit too civilized, too complacent for their own good. It's interesting that this complacency was fractured by the most memorable episode of the first two years, ""Q Who?"" which introduced The Borg. All of a sudden, exploration was not a routine venture.

Other memorable episodes of the first 2 years: the double-length pilot, introducing Q; ""Conspiracy""-an early invasion thriller; ""Where No One Has Gone Before""-an ultimate attempt to define the exploring theme; ""The Big Goodbye""-the first lengthy exploration of the new holodeck concept; ""Datalore""-intro of Data's evil twin; ""Skin of Evil""-death of Tasha Yar; ""11001001""-perhaps the best holodeck story; and ""The Measure of a Man""-placing an android on trial. Except for ""Q Who"" the 2nd year was even more of a letdown from the first. Space started to percolate in the 3rd season. I liked ""The Survivors""-introducing an entity resembling Q in a depressed mood, and ""Deja Q"" with both Q & Guinan squaring off, as well as other alien beings. A remaining drawback was the 'techno-babble' hindering many scripts, an aspect which made them less exciting than the stories of the original series. As Roddenberry himself believed, when characters spoke this way, it did not come across as naturalistic, except maybe when it was Data (Spiner), the android. The engineer La Forge (Burton), for example, was usually saddled with long, dull explanatory dialog for the audience.

In the 3rd year, truly innovative concepts such as the far-out parallel-universe adventure ""Yesterday's Enterprise"" began to take hold, topped by the season-ender ""The Best of Both Worlds,part 1"" in which The Borg returned in their first try at assimilating Earth. After this and the 2nd part, the TNG show was off and running, at full warp speed. There are too many great episodes from the next 4 seasons to list here, but I tended to appreciate the wild, cosmic concept stories best: ""Parallels""(s7); ""Cause and Effect""(s5); ""Timescape""(s6); ""Tapestry""(s6); and the scary ""Frame of Mind"", ""Schisms"" and ""Genesis."" There's also the mind-blowing ""Inner Light""(s5), ""Conundrum"" and ""Ship in a Bottle""(s6), ""Second Chances."" The intense 2-parter ""Chain of Command"" was almost like a film, and the great return of Scotty in ""Relics"" was very entertaining, though it showed you can't go home again. The show also continued to tackle uneasy social issues, as in ""The Host"", ""The Outcast"", ""First Contact"" and ""The Drumhead"" as well as political:""Darmok"", ""Rightful Heir"", ""Face of the Enemy"" and ""The Pegasus."" The series ended on a strong note, ""All Good Things..."" a double-length spectacular with nearly the budget of a feature film. But it wasn't really the end. A few months later, an actual feature film was released ""Star Trek Generations""(94). It's rather ironic that the TNG films couldn't match the innovation and creativity of the last 4 seasons of the series. ""Star Trek Insurrection""(98) for example, is a lesser effort than any of the episodes mentioned above."
"This is an interesting, thought provoking, and most of all entertaining series. Gene Roddenberry not only gave us a ""Wagon Train to the Stars,"" but he gave us interesting stories reflecting the great values our society holds as truths. I know that ""some"" episodes were not that good, but that can be said of any series that has a long history. For the most part this program exceeds the mark of excellence in writing and entertainment. The delivery of the writing by Patrick Stewart, Brent Spiner et. al. truly brought the Star Trek future to life. The casting of this program is wonderful!

I would hope that anyone with the desire for interesting intelligent science fiction would find this program enjoyable. If a person today is ONLY seeking an action packed thrill ride, then perhaps they may not find the value in Star Trek. But I have loved the program from the first day I watched Captain Kirk in ""The Man Trap"" from 1966. Since then I have watched the development of Trek with an open mind. I believe that ST-TNG to be the best incarnation of all Trek programs, to date.

In this day and age of terrorism, and threats of war, it would be nice if we could apply more of the philosophies from the possible future of this series. Maybe if more people watched this program the world would be a nicer place!?!"
I love TNG so much. All the characters are superb and Captain Picard is the best Captain ever. My favourite episode is always have been The Inner Light. 10/10.
"In an early episode, Captain Picard delivers a line from Hamlet: ""What a piece of work is a man! How noble in reason, how infinite in faculty! In form and moving how express and admirable! In action how like an Angel! in apprehension how like a god!"" But he delivers it with conviction instead of irony, and by doing so creates the thesis of the entire franchise.

Star Trek was never meant to be a realistic depiction of what the future will be like; rather, it's an optimistic argument for what the future could be like. Our heroes on the new Starship Enterprise are noble and rational, and the writing is more concerned with ethics than with punch-ups. Fans of Captain Kirk's red-blooded man of action might be disappointed, but then this is a more mature version of Star Trek. As we mature, we realize there are better ways to solve our problems than with violence. Patrick Stewart's Shakespearean captain is a renaissance man, capable of using the right words and unexpected actions to overcome obstacles, and he needs neither a hairpiece nor a fight scene to prove his character.

The show's other standout star is the android Data, Spock's opposite yet kindred spirit. Where Spock repressed his emotions and was disdainful of illogical humans, Data is curious about our foibles and aspires to be more like us. That implies that being human is not a curse, but something wonderful and virtuous.

There are no space wars in The Next Generation, and for a good reason: creator Gene Roddenberry hoped that by the 24th century war would be a thing of the past. The interpersonal conflicts and domestic dramas of other shows are here replaced by adventure and exploration. Human nature doesn't have to be absolute: people can change, and humanity can grow and evolve. Star Trek: The Next Generation is seven seasons of optimistic, outward-looking space adventure for people who believe that the human race doesn't need to be defined by the villains it faces, but by its own innate spirit."
"This series is a true marvel! I don't recall seeing any other series so diverse in its thematology, so rich in ideas. Patrick Stewart really adds a lot of depth to his role, throughout the series there are references to drama, literature, science that make some episodes a true journey through beautiful ideas. Also, the plot is sometimes very good, despite the scientific discrepancies one often encounters, or the effects that might at some points appear outdated. This is science fiction that aims to elucidate the eternal human questions, not just give a dramatized prospect of human evolution. Data is a unique character, his interaction with the captain (and the rest of the crew) is uniquely enjoyable, often giving insights into the evolution of human ethics, as for example in an episode where Captain Piccard is called to support the view that Data is a conscious life form and thus has the right to decide for his own fate; that he cannot be considered as property, even though he is a human construct. You really never know where the next episode will take you...from MacBeth to Cyrano, or from Data's love affair to the first contact with the crystaline entity, or Sherlock Holmes mysteries. Truly, I have never seen any other series with such a broad range of ideas and references. I wish to thank all those who made it possible, and Patrick Stewart for adding such a dramatic depth to his role. Truly, in no other case has an actor in TV done such a great job at combining so diverse elements in a single character, and with so superb acting...Patrick Stewart really carries you away with his acting, it is epic to say the least. I remember him in so many roles, never did he disappoint me.

Its a magnificent work of art, one that stretches across many marvels of the human intellect to create its beautiful and educating (in the Greek sense, as actors become teachers of life through their dilemmas and adventures) drama."
"Grew up watching this show and the characters feel like family. Of course you have a weird or bad epp once in a while but for a whole it is just awesome. The science fiction is believable, the music is awesome, acting is spot on, really makes one's imagination wonder."
"Following the success of the Star Trek movies in the mid 1980s, the producers decided to put ST back on the small screen with a shiny new Enterprise a new crew and a whole host of new species worlds and enemies. The first season and the majority of the second season are a bit shaky but from the third season it picks up massively. Patrick Stewart is now the captain, a more cerebral, diplomatic captain and played wonderfully. This series introduced far more relationships between the crew (Troi and Riker, Worf and his son, Crusher and Picard) which play out beautifully over the course of the series. The Special effects considering their now nearly 15-20 years old still look good and the Enterprise D is a true flagship vessel.

There's so many good episodes it's kind of hard to pick out anymore than the main standouts most people have mentioned already, Yesterday's Enterprise, The Best of Both Worlds, The Inner Light are probably the most popular but everything, certainly post seasons one and two provides good solid sci fi."
"Star Trek: The Next Generation is not just a TV show. It is a philosophy. TNG resembles the very best of Sciencie-Fiction tackling our everyday problems and beyond with a clear vision and moral compass. Gene Roddenberry was a true visionary and his ideas for a bright and positive future of mankind live on in this show. This vision is presented to you via great writing, brilliant acting, beautiful sets and effects (for its time) and an iconic soundtrack from grandmaster Jerry Goldsmith himself. They simply don't make shows like this anymore."
"I've watched this in 2019 and at the beginning i was sceptical because it felt so dated and cheesy but man i'm glad i've endured season 1 because what i got was really smart and well written science fiction and not the explosion action filled one we get nowdays. This show is about the ethical and moral dilemma of future civilization exploring space. While some episode are clearly filler they are still really watchable thanks to the amazing cast of characters you end up caring about, even secondary ones i really didn't like i ended up caring and rooting for them. The good episodes on the other hand are really some of the best television i've ever seen, they put the crew in really thought provoking situations with most of the time a satisfying ending. I really reccomend this show to anyone that is even a little bit interested in science fiction and if you are scared by the colossal lenght of this show since it's basically a collection of adventures the enterprise goes through you can also watch the best rated episodes even though i reccomend watching the whole show."
I'm a huge Trekkie. I think this series did a great job of creating the universe but didn't run with it as well as movies like First Contact did. Definitely ds9 trumps this in terms of entertainment value
"Where to begin? The characters in ST:TNG were just dreadful. The crew was a collection of shiny, happy, perfect, cold fish, with no depth, no passions that ever seemed more than a put-on, and who were evocative of nothing--the sort of people you'd send millions of miles away just to get rid of them. This was probably inevitable, given the circumstances of their creation. Most of them weren't created as ""characters"" at all, but were conceived as nothing more than line-item gimmicks--an empath, a Klingon, a teenager, a Pinnochio-modeled android, a blind man at the helm.

Whatever glue Gene Roddenberry was sniffing at the time convinced him that the last--a blind man leading them--was a *fantastic* metaphor (luckily, cooler heads later prevailed, and the blind guy was packed off to Engineering).

Most of the show's significant elements were cannibalized from earlier projects. Storywise, a gap of about 80 years is supposed to exist between the original series and TNG, but they're still using exactly the same technology, in the time of TNG, as they were in the original. All of the same equipment, with all of the same capabilities and limitations; technology hasn't advanced an inch in eight decades. TNG's one technological ""innovation"" was the holodeck, and even it was lifted from the ST: Phase One project from the '70s (which had mutated into ST: The Motion Picture, sans holodeck). That project also provided two of the other TNG characters: Will Riker was Will Decker from STP1, with Troi as the Ilia-modeled empath with whom he'd formerly had a relationship.

TNG also cannibalized the original series for stories. The first season of TNG was littered, from beginning to end, with plots and other elements lifted directly from the original. This unmotley crew of gimmicks spent their first season blandly going where the first Enterprise crew had gone before. The show improved significantly later but its major defects were structural, and stayed with it throughout (which is why it's so hard to watch in re-runs). The improvements shouldn't be overstated, either: TNG ran for 8 seasons, and if one were to extract all the good-to-great episodes from the entire run, there wouldn't be enough to fill a single season. I found much of it unwatchable when first running, and it holds up even worse on second viewings. Overall, just a really awful idea, done, for the most part, badly.

The writers also seemed genuinely committed to the notion--and this is one of the things I hated most about TNG--that meaningless technobabble is a substitute for competent writing. The ultimate outcome of what seemed like dozens of episodes hinged on whether a polymorphic induction framistat could be made to generate a positronic field, or whether Geordi and the robot could rejigger a 10 power electron thingamabob to elliptically convert alpha waves into magnetized mercury particles.

""Make it so, Number One."" And he does, and the universe is saved. Except that's really, really stupid, and unengaging. This was a problem TNG never overcame."
"People that watch science fiction seem to forget that Star Trek: The Next Generation was filmed from 1987 to 1994, and that it accomplished the breakthrough technical wizardry we now see in other sci-fi movies and television shows.

It was Star Trek: The Next Generation (STTNG) that accomplished the ""orange screen"", reducing by 2/3 the cost of shooting space sequences. It was STTNG that finally allowed for a very advanced and yet BELIEVABLE ""evolved"" human behavior involved in space travel.

I admired Captain Jean-Luc Picard for his reserved Brit style, and the tension between him and Dr. Beverly Crusher. Who did not like watching Lieutenant Commander Data and Lieutenant Geordi LaForge spar over human behavior? What about the short brilliant life of Lieutenant Natasha Yar? Who didn't tune in to see that? Commander William Riker was amazing to watch, as he grew a beard and a conscience -- while still being able to keep up with the great Lieutenant Worf, the only Klingon (as yet) in Star Fleet!?

Those of you out there trying still to wage the Star Wars - Star Trek battle for supremacy -- grow up! They are both inspiring stories in different universes."
"What a great show. Really takes the original to another level, both visually and intellectually. Sticks to the original recipe of Stand alone episodes, full of adventure with a great cast. I can't believe this is now over 30 years old. Will not disappoint."
Even after decades this is still the best TV show ever made. Roddenberry's vision for the future of humanity serves as an outstanding everlasting inspiration. And the show is enjoyable and has so many facets and layers so even after watching it for the 10th time it always gives something new and deep to think about.
"In fact, Star Trek Next Generation (STNG) was & continues to be IMHO, the very best Star Trek series since the original Kirk / Spock series.

I Genuinely believe that STNG, Unlike Star Trek Discovery, Picard, and Star Trek Strange new worlds, was / is far better, due to the fact that it stuck firmly to the original writing and ideas of the great Gene Roddenberry!.

Yes, it is true to say that STNG did suffer somewhat script wise, after Roddenberry's death.

That said, generally speaking the script writers did return to the Roddenberry original Next Generation format.

Actors such as Patrick Stewart (Captain Jean- Luc Picard), Levar Burton (Geordi Laforge), Marina Sirtis ( Deanna Troi), Michael Dorn ( Lt. Worf), Gates Mc Fadden ( Dr. Beverly Crusher) Colm Meaney ( Miles O' Brien) and the ever annoying Jonathan Frakes ( Lusty Cmdr Riker), Brent Spiner (Lt. Cmdr Data) and Wil Wheaton (Wesley Crusher).

Brought together some exceptionally great actors, some more annoying and some who, like Colm Meaney and Michael Dorn were given far less good lines, than their skill set and characters actually deserved.

Despite this, Star Trek next generation was generally well scripted, with only few exceptions to the rule.

Nevertheless, over all STNG was and even in 2022, continues to be watched by Trekkies and holds a very important place in the hearts of fans!.

It is considered to be the ONLY genuine Star Trek series which comes close to the original series!.

All in all, a very deserving 9 out of 10 for Star Trek Next Generation the series.

A final Thank You!, to one actor who is sadly very often overlooked, when it comes to admiration of STNG acting skills.

I therefore mention Majel Barret, as without her wonderful voice STNG would NOT have been such a great experience. Majel was the voice actor, who voiced the vessel computer and her unmistakable voice is constantly heard throughout 104 episodes.

Sadly, Majel passed away in 2008 at the age of 76.

She had multiple Star Trek-related roles, though she is mostly remembered for her roles as Nurse Christine Chapel in ""Star Trek: The Original Series"" (1966-1969), as Lwaxana Troi ( Mother to Deanna Troi) in ""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" (1987-1994) and ""Star Trek: Deep Space Nine"" (1993-1999)."
"I have been hooked on this show ever since I rented a couple of episodes on video over 10 years ago. The series was shown on Norwegian Television, but they stopped it at the end of the forth season. I then bought the whole series, one season after another on DVD. I watched all the episodes, and I realized how great this show is. Over the course of the series, the characters deepen and it gets to be more and more interesting. There is the mishap of the second season, but although it was the worst season, it did have some very good episodes, like 'The Measure of a Man' and 'Q Who?'. I have seen this show now five times from start to finish (and I think that will be seeing much more), but I have found that the episodes which are much action oriented, like the double episode 'Chain of Command', was quite boring. I love episodes like 'Darmok', 'The Inner Light', 'Disaster', 'The Nth Degree', 'First Contact' and 'Who Watches The Watchers?' where the crew meet new races or find themselves in a situation that they are not used to.

This is a series that can be appealing to people who like to see action in their science fiction and people who like to see, meet and know new races in their science fiction. This was a fantastic show."
As a late stater who is of 22 years of age and has never watched a star trek series in my life and has been a life long fan of star wars.This series's has changed my entire perception of star trek. I would never of thought i would love this. as I thought it was too slow paced. But the complexity of theses characters and the overall development. Has completely taken me by surprise. Even if you are not a star trek fan. I would definitely ask you to check this out
"I read somewhere that Patrick Steward is proud of the educational role Star Trek – The Next Generation had over young viewers. I'm glad he enjoyed his work just as much as we did, because it had indeed quite an influence on me as a child. I practically grew up with the Enterprise crew, and Captain Picard was one of my role-models. Even now, revisiting the series restores my belief that the world will get better.

After all these years, TNG is still so much fun, even more so. In a media landscape full of violence of all kinds, Star Trek – The Next Generation is something to treasure. It's that unique 'feel-good' vibe, the funny make-ups, wild scenarios and holodeck escapism, that make it a magic, timeless adventure. An ode to diversity, exploration, friendship and growth, TNG is the evidence that true values can be affirmed in a manner that is both educational and great fun. Gene Rodenberry had an admirable vision of the future...

The series stayed faithful to the characters until the end, and it's a miracle that it didn't ""jump the shark"", which seems to be the fate of all successful series, for some reason. STNG just got better and better with each season until its final episode, thanks to Patrick Stewart's growing involvement in the production, script and character development. Rarely do we see a truly gifted actor with such dedication to his craft.

Among all characters, Captain Picard shines with his tremendous commanding presence, wisdom and moral stature. Patrick Stewart's talent, professionalism and commitment to the role are that one thing holding everything together.

My favorite episodes include ""Chain of Command"" with the memorable Ronny Cox as a non-villainous antagonist, ""The Big Good Bye"" and ""The Measure of a Man"". There are many, countless others that are just as good, in fact I love them ALL."
"I've watched every episode of this show tens of times. And I never get bored of it. Though some people may not be as easy to please as me, I can guarantee that you will like it.This series was my childhood, and helped turn me into the person I am today. I will never stop loving this series."
Thus series represents the relaunch of Trek on TV and produced some much beloved characters. It also was home to some of the absolute worst Trek episodes ever made... I find both Voyager and DS9 have aged better. DS9 especially.
"In my teens I was fanatical about the show. The possibilities, the dreams, the inspiration. We had Star Trek nights, Star Trek arguments, Start Trek groups. Yes, I was a big fan.

So over twenty years later, I sat down to binge watch this show again. Twenty years ago I would have rated this an easy 10, now it is a generous 5.

My biggest disappointments are

1. What is their mission? The opening credits clearly state ""...To explore strange new worlds, to seek out new life and new civilisations..."". But in nearly every episode they are encountering a human colony, or within a few hours of a star base, or near the border of the neutral zone, or they are intercepting a shuttle craft. Apart from the three times they were flung to the far reaches of the Universe by The Traveller or Q, they never left Federation space. An Earth based analogy would be... ""They have left the city and are now driving around the suburbs, with the occasional foray into the rural countryside"". How are they exploring strange new worlds in their own backyard? Little imagination by the writers.

2. The writers really did have a poor imagination of future life. All technology on the show looks clumsy, awkward and clunky. Really, did none of the writers or set designers consider slimline, sleek, holographic computer displays, flexible screens, screens with dynamic displays instead of the silly stenciled screens we see every episode, etc...

3. The awards... Have you seen some of these awards? ""Outstanding Individual Achievement in Costume Design"", ""Outstanding Individual Achievement in Editing "" and ""Outstanding Hairstyling for a Series"". Seriously?? This reminds me of awards being handed out to children in an event, even when they come last. Feel good awards.

4. Characters were flat and poorly written but the standout performances of the regular cast were definitely Data and Captain Picard

5. Worf who was supposed to be some powerful security officer, but had his butt kicked in every single fighting scene, except two.

6. Deanna Troi who had the annoying ability to state the obvious, but had no ability to use her powers when they were most needed. For a councilor she is over emotional and prone to fits of hysteria. Not the stability one would expect of a ships councilor. And to surpass her co-workers to become equal second highest rank on the ship was too much of a stretch to be taken seriously.

7. Star Trek TOS of the 1960's seems to have set the technology standard for this show. Amazing that 30 years after TOS and the writers of TNG could not come up with anything unique, rather they were just extensions of the existing technology.

Unfortunately, this has gone from memories of a great show with some bad episodes, to a very mediocre show with the rare good episode. It will be a show I never re-watch."
"Four teen friends and their dog encounter supernatural mysteries and always end up solving them. They travel around in their van The Mystery Machine and happen upon these random mysteries. There is the jock Fred, beautiful Daphne, nerdy brain Velma, and hungry slacker Shaggy. Scooby Doo is Shaggy's bumbling dog. The kids bribe him with Scooby snakes. Inevitably, the gang traps a perpetrator hiding behind the supernatural scares.

This is classic children's TV. It is an easy, simple formula. It is super family-friendly. Scooby is fun. Don't expect exceptional plots. Each episode has a similar structure. There is also the groovy theme song."
"I will not pretend that Scooby Doo, Where are You! is high art, or the greatest animated series ever; however, there is a reason this is a classic and so fondly remembered. This hits so many strong points, from the eerie music, the oppressive yet whimsical tone, and the creepy and sometimes scary villains. Perhaps the most daring has to be the choice of such a dark color scheme(especially for 1969.) All this contributes to the wonderful mood that permeates Scooby Doo. It is a shame that many future Scooby Doo series could not equal the magic that was there in 1969, because they got so much right. The first season is by far the best, but do not knock the second, both are great.

The Gang(Shaggy, Velma, Daphne, Fred, and of course Scooby Doo) travel around in their van(The Mystery Machine) and investigate seemingly supernatural events. This allows each episode to have it's own spooky locale with a wacky spin on the horror genre. Primarily Shaggy and Scooby Doo are the main focus of the show, acting as comic relief to the goings on. Lastly by encouraging critical thinking, having rational explanations, and showing them confronting their fears teaches good lessons to children, who are the target audience. Not that adults can't absolutely love this show, as the superb mix of comedy, mystery, horror, and atmosphere all make this a great cartoon for all ages!

If you liked this show and wanted more Scooby shows, I recommend, The New Scooby-Doo Movies, The 13 Ghosts of Scooby-Doo, What's New, Scooby-Doo?, and Scooby-Doo! Mystery Incorporated. They are all a little different, but are about as good if not better."
"I still watch it from time to time. If you're only going to buy one DVD, the one pictured for this (Original Mysteries) is the one to get. This is a cartoon that has stood the test of time. Values such as perseverance, friendship, honesty, and problem-solving are introduced to young viewers. Also, for a cartoon the voice actors do a very good job with their lines. This probably could have been an audio-only radio show. The animation is very simplistic, but adds to the overall effect and allowed Hanna Barbera to release so many episodes on time. The soundtrack is done moderately well and adds to the mood, though never gets in the way of the characters or plot. You'll find that you'll hear the same clips of music repeated throughout the series and even some of the music creeps all the way into season three. Overall, great show and worth a watch for sure."
"While Disney and Warner Bros. are the kings of made-for-film cartoons, Hanna-Barbera are the kings of made-for-TV cartoons. The creators of The Flintstones, The Jetsons, Yogi Bear, and Hong Kong Phooey; they've all been successful, but the crown jewel of their creations is Scooby Doo.

Unlike most cartoons, Scooby Doo was a smart and ingenious creation that required thinking and deep thought. The adventures of four teen sleuths and their Great Dane have been a regular viewing pleasure for years. Heck, I still watch it today. The best episodes were the first ones from 1969-72. I think they got progressively better over time because in the early ones, they didn't have enough suspects; usually, they'd only meet up with the guy who was the criminal. Later, they'd have 4 or 5 guys who could be the one unmasked at the end.

As for Scrappy, the only episodes worth seeing with him were when he's with the full cast, solving mysteries. I liked him here, because the act with Scooby and Shaggy always being frightened of every situation got tiresome; at least Scrappy would go right in, and Shaggy and Scooby had no choice but to follow him in, or Scrappy would egg them on. Only when they didn't have the full cast and were only in comic situations (i.e. all the other shows) would the show be awful."
"This was my favourite TV show when I was about 10, now at 17 I still love it. I can't help it, it is a classic. This show has great animation for its time, and I find the show enormously entertaining. I love the theme tune, very catchy, and the writing is always amusing. I love the characters too, especially Scooby, wonderfully voiced by Don Messick, and Casey Kasem as Shaggy never fails to bring a smile to my face. Fred, Velma and Daphne are great too, and the villains are memorable with only 49ner being a disappointment(too obvious), from Captain Redbeard, the Creeper and the really creepy ghost of Captain Cutler, I can't actually decide which one's my favourite. As much as I like the Scooby Doo Show and most of the movies, this show will always be my favourite. 10/10 Bethany Cox."
"I heard that the creators wanted to have the youngsters solve mysteries that involved scary characters, but the execs found the bad guys a bit too intense for young audiences. Enter Scooby-Doo, the wacky, funny great dane. They make him the focus of the series, the counterbalance to the villains, and the rest is history.

I enjoy the many memorable lines, and contrary to what you might think, they're not just from Shaggy. They include Daphne saying to the Swamp Witch, ""You can't believe everything you read"" or Freddie saying to Shaggy as he's trying to get into the museum to see the Knight, ""That's it, no more jack."" Just a great series, especially if you enjoy the quirks and sayings of the late 60's/early 70's."
"I still think that Scooby Doo is a great cartoon. There's something that's magical about the work of Bill Hanna and Joseph Babera's work that stands out in my mind and now that these animation geniuses are gone there's nothing left but the memories of my childhood when Scooby Doo made a comeback along with the Flintstones, The Jetsons, and the Gobots. I can't thank Bill and Joe enough for their work because I have a lot of great memories of coming home from school and watching their shows that they made so memorable. I appreciated a lot of the work that Mr Hanna and Mr Barbera did and what it means to a lot of people.

It's something that will be with me for always."
"This stuff keeps getting better. I grew up on Scooby, and now I get to watch it with my kids. I know I've seen all four of these episodes a hundred times (about half of those in the month we've owned the tape), but it doesn't matter. Even if you can recite the dialogue line for line, it's still great TV. And unlike those package deals with live action shows, repeated viewings of Scooby and company are never tedious. Thanks to the Cartoon Network for sticking four on the tape (two seems all too common with TV show video tapes) and for keeping Scrappy Doo where he belongs (out of site). The ""behind the scenes"" clips are fun, too."
"Scooby-Doo, that big, hungry, cowardly yet charismatic, often unintentionally heroic and loveable Great Dane, and his four human sidekicks, Shaggy, Fred, Daphne & Velma, made their debut over 35 years ago, 1969 to be exact, and the Mystery Inc. gang are still going strong today, with countless follow up cartoons (including the loathsome ""A Pup Named Scooby-Doo""), the direct to to video Scooby movies (Zombie Island, Witch's Ghost, Alien Invaders, etc) and the live action movies starring husband/wife team Freddie Prinze Jr., Sarah Michelle Gellar, Matthew Lillard and Linda Cardellini. And it was all inspired by a Frank Sinatra song...

How does Scooby & the gang do it? Given their predictable formula, the Mystery Inc gang thwarting ""nut jobs in Halloween costumes"" every episode, could have gone horribly stale and would have killed countless weaker shows, but somehow, Scooby & the gang endured. Also the characters are not incredibly diverse: Fred the stalwart leader who looks like a blond Captain Kirk with a knack for building traps due to usually ignored past history as a boy scout(as movie Velma put it, ""He was so handsome... and he really knew how to accessorize.""), Daphne the red head who keeps getting captured (but she would stumble upon clues and showed in the episode ""Hassle In The Castle"" that she had the potential to defend herself, as shown when she accidentally hit Shaggy with the vase), Velma the straight arrow brains of the outfit, and Shaggy the gangly goof-ball chicken with a passion for eating. So how do they do it? Well, for one thing, there are tons of repetitive shows out there (admit it, ""Batman: The Animated Series"" was basically about Batman thwarting villains every episode or two parter) who's characters may grow but remain the same at the core. 2, Scooby is hard not to like because he's very inoffensive as a protagonist, as are his human companions, and he's probably the only hero to openly admit that he's scared on a regular basis.

Another part of the appeal must be the physical comedy of Scooby and Shaggy (he's not a stoner, DAMN IT!), and that great theme song (too bad the theme wasn't used in EVERY INCARNATION). Sadly, some of the follow up broke the gang up to where it was just Daphne with Shaggy & Scooby or just Scooby & Shaggy, who were probably the most popular characters out of the bunch, but as we all know, Scooby was at his best when he was with the rest of the gang.

So I can't completely explain it, but I thank God for Scooby-Doo. Long live Scooby & the gang."
"Right off the mark I'll say that this is going to be dated for the younger crowd and horribly so.

The animation is typical Hannah-Barbara and, people my age love it but I don't think that love would transfer well to the sleek computer animations that so many Millennials and post Millennials are accustomed to.

Still, we have the songs that hearken back to the Monkeys TV show and the chase scenes that are reminiscent of Benny Hill even though they all have a repeating background. A plot that is sort of, kind of like the Archies, meets Captain Cave-Man, meets classic horror teens in danger with a twist.

Its the show that started it, the show that I loved as a child, and one that still works for what it is.

If you can overcome how dated it is, the shows are still entertaining and fun."
"Classic Hanna Barbara cartoon about four mystery-solving teenage sleuths(confident Fred, beautiful Daphne, intelligent Velma, and frightened but hungry Shaggy) and their easily frightened but often hungry dog Scooby Doo travel the roads of America in their van the Mystery Machine solving mysteries that are always some crook in a mask and/or costume. The original series ran for 25 episodes, then later a further 16(going by what's on the DVDs) and is most enjoyable, certainly brings back childhood memories. Nicely animated and memorable characters, has a distinct atmosphere to it, with a superb theme song. Obviously strains credibility that the gang keeps running into the same type of crooks, and little sense of continuity among episodes, this is still a lot of fun, and things hadn't gotten too silly yet, like they would later when they met celebrities and real ghosts...none of that here!"
"I grew up watching some of the 70's Scooby-Doo cartoons, but never did I see one episode from the original late 60's show. Now that I've finished it, I certainly know that the formula of the mystery gang has survived all the way into the 21's century.

I have always liked the simplicity of the show, so therefore I'm pretty biased, because HB Productions was never known for expertise in animation and pioneered the limited animation style of saturday morning cartoons which saved them the money. But they must have done something right, because like I said, the premise has survived for fifty years and Scooby-Doo is among the most iconic cartoon character up their with Mickey Mouse and Bugs Bunny.

It's a matter of taste, I guess, because I like the show for its simple premise and doesn't mind the rather one-note characters. A classic with charming simplicity."
"""Scooby-Doo, Where are you!"" is probably my favorite ""Scooby-Doo"" show. Each episode featured Scooby, and the gang riding along in their van called ""The Mystery Machine"", and stumble into a mystery. Along the way, the gang would discover clues, Shaggy and Scooby would be eating a lot, and get scared constantly, the ghost/demon/monster/zombie whatnot would be unmasked unveiling someone that the gang encountered earlier, and that would be that for the half-an-hour of programming bliss.

I have to agree with the majority, this has to be Hanna-Barbera's CROWNING achievement, and I hope it's on for years to come (just a little less with Cartoon Network airing it too much). This gets a perfect 10!!

SCOOBY DOOBY DOO!!!!!!!!!"
"This cartoon series features my favorite cartoon character, Scooby Doo, and represents one of the best things from my childhood and is the first and original show starring the character, which have spawn many series sequels and incarnations and movies.

Here, a group of young sleuths, Fred, Daphne, Velma and Shaggy, form the Mystery Incorporated, Inc., a crime-solving organization, along with their great dane, Scooby. You get to see good classic detective elements in the episodes, from finding clues to splitting up to investigate. The antagonists is almost always a ghostly or out-of-this world figure, which gives this show a suspenseful and horror touch. But, what results all together are the hilarious gags and comedy that the characters serve up.

Shaggy and Scooby are the best friends in the show and deliver probably the best dose of laughs, from their cowardly stance toward solving mysteries to their hunger for snacks to their slapstick style of dealing with each problematic situation. Velma is the bookworm in the bunch, but possesses a witty and deadpan humor deliverance that adds onto the show's laugh-out-loud humor. Fred and Daphne are the more serious of the bunch, with Fred being the group's leader and Daphne usually being the damsel-in-distress.

It's an entertaining show that I looked forward to watch after school or on the weekends - one that certainly makes your mood feel better and keeps you filled with suspense and make you laugh your hearts out. Even as an adult, I would catch certain episodes of this show just for the fun of it.

Grade A"
"I don't think it's entirely my nostalgia speaking when I say that these 25 episodes make up what is still the greatest children's TV show in existence. And it probably will remain the greatest for a very long time. I know that when I have kids, this will be the first show that I watch with them. And if they don't like it I guess I'll just have to get new kids."
"Scooby-Doo was a big part of my childhood and was one of my favorite cartoons (Alongside Dexters Laboratory,Powerpuff Girls,Hong Kong Phooey and Danger Mouse). My favorite character is Shaggy as he is funny. I love his voice provided by the late Casey Casem. my favorite monsters are Miner 49er,Black Knight Ghost,Captain Cutler and Captain Redbeard. Definitely a classic cartoon not to be missed at any cost although I suggest skipping the later episodes with Scrappy as they are awful.Plus Fred,Daphne and Velma are absent so it misses the charm of the classic 1969-78 shows.

9/10. Kids will love the adventures of Scooby and the adults will certainly have a nostalgic spot for him too."
Sometimes it's fun and quirky. Definitely not a bad show.
"The Scooby series that started it all! The great thing about this show is that on the surface its premise is so simple, and yet underneath all that you have five characters who on their own would be useless, but together form an awesome team.

The premise and standard story line is often mocked, but it is effective, and brought to life by a brilliant original voice team, headed up by Casey Kasem.

There have been so many other TV shows based on the characters, as well as films etc, but they all take their inspiration from this original legendary TV series from 1969."
"As a longtime fan of classic television, I have always had a special place in my heart for Scooby-Doo, Where Are You? This beloved animated series has captured the imaginations of generations of viewers with its lovable characters, thrilling mysteries, and unique blend of humor and suspense.

One of the things that sets Scooby-Doo, Where Are You? Apart from other animated programs is the depth and complexity of its characters. Each gang member brings something unique, from the cowardly yet loyal Scooby-Doo himself to his brave human companions. Whether it's Fred's leadership skills, Daphne's resourcefulness, or Velma's intelligence, every character plays a role in solving the latest mystery.

Speaking of mysteries, the cases tackled by the gang are always exciting and entertaining. From haunted houses to ghostly pirates, each episode has no shortage of thrills and chills. What I appreciate most about the show's mysteries is how they balance humor and suspense. Even when things get tense, there is always a lighthearted moment or witty one-liner to keep things from getting too heavy.

Of course, discussing this Scooby-Doo show would only be complete by mentioning the show's iconic animation style. While it may not be as advanced as modern cartoons, there is a certain charm to the hand-drawn characters and backgrounds. Each episode feels like a labor of love, with attention paid to every detail and expression.

I would give Scooby-Doo, Where Are You? A solid 7 out of 10 stars. While it may not be perfect, it is a must-watch for anyone who loves a good mystery with a touch of humor. Whether you're a longtime fan or a newcomer to the series, something magical about this classic show will keep you coming back for more."
"I know that this was a kid's show, and I know that it aired in the '70s, but STILL, every time I watched an episode with my sister (when I was still young) I felt like my intelligence was being insulted.

Boring characters, predictable plots, unfunny jokes and bad animation made Scooby-Doo a pile of, well.... doggy doo. I'll never understand why this show was so popular, because aside from a few catchy songs now and then, it had absolutely no redeeming features.

Besides that, it was quite obvious that Shaggy and Scooby were a pair of stingers. They always had the munchies and whenever they left the van there was a puff of smoke. Also, Freddy had NO personality whatsoever. While he and Daphne were off ""looking for clues"" (yeah right) Scooby and Shaggy always got themselves into trouble. How come he never figured out that the two of them couldn't be trusted on their own?

Anyway, you shouldn't watch this show. You should watch ""Josie and the Pussycats"" instead."
Daredevil was such an incredible show! Charlie Cox (Daredevil) and Vincent D'Onofrio (Wilson Fisk) led such an amazing cast who were all at the top of their game throughout this amazing series! It's too bad that Marvel and Netflix had to split up because they made some pretty special shows. All of them were great but Daredevil and The Punisher were easily the best among them! It's one of the best superhero/crime shows ever made and where all 3 seasons were great! There's really not much more to say that hasn't already been said about this amazing show so just do yourself a favor and go watch it.
I was gutted when Daredevil was cancelled. Easily the best super-hero show on TV. Let's not give up on Red yet. #SaveDaredevil
"Let me start by saying Daredevil season 1 was so great it was the reason I got Netflix.Daredevil season 2 for me was ok,I really liked the punisher but I didn't feel much for the main plot.but wow season 3 ..I would probably get my memory erased to relive this masterpiece again... Every character which is introduced has a proper backstory.you actually care about each and every persons motives.you get to choose who you like.i love great villians and this show delivers not one but two.Wilson Fisk from season 1 itself was very impressive and season 3 he delivers an exemplary performance,but the person who stole the show was bullseye,his character development was amazing and the action scenes were phenomenal.usually shows have plot holes ,directors don't really care to fill them up but this show had no plot holes.It was really amazing ,they went for a bit unexpected ending which I really liked.usually multiple villains ruin movies and shows but this they did it so well.lol,this is probably how been afflecks Daredevil movie should have been.Must watch :)"
"As a huge fan of Marvel I'm a little biased because I pretty much like everything they put out. My bias aside, Daredevil is terrific! It's actually my favorite Marvel show (along with The Punisher). If you don't believe me just read through the reviews here and look at the ratings. Even the critics loved this. Charlie Cox and Vincent D'Onofrio were born to play Daredevil and Kingpin. They're easily the best part of the show. This is a show that you'll want to binge as quickly as you can, it's that good. It's too bad that Netflix couldn't renew their contracts with Marvel and they had to stop making the Netflix Marvel shows because every single one of them was great! Now that they're on Disney they can bring these wonderful characters back. They already started to with Daredevil and Kingpin showing up in other shows and they just renewed Daredevil for another season. Now they have to do the same for The Punisher, Luke Cage and Jessica Jones. At least bring them back into the MCU somehow. If you're a Marvel fan then this is a must watch!"
"I seriously don't understand why Netflix would cancel this show. The writing was spectacular, the acting was phenomenal, the action scenes are just perfect, and so much more. I cannot even express my love for this show. I was a fan of the Flash and thought it was a good show until I watched this. I haven't even continued the Flash since because it does NOT compare to this show.

Vincent D'Onofrio's Wilson Fisk is easily my favorite MCU villain. He's just so compelling and thrilling. He truly brings this show to life. Jon Bernthal as Punisher was absolutely flawless. Wilson Bethel as Bullseye is a fantastic villain. And finally, we have Daredevil himself: Charlie Cox. Charlie Cox IS Daredevil. No question about it. Just watch it. You'll thank yourself.

This is a spectacular, more realistic adaptation of Daredevil and it works so well. The action is done much more realistically, making them even better. Action, character development, story, all the things a TV show and movie should have can all be found right here.

WATCH. IT. It will change superhero shows for you forever"
"This is not your average super hero show. I love the dark tone of the show. It has great story, great acting, and great action. Go ahead and watch this show."
"The Marvel Netflix Universe was the best thing in Netflix along with ''Jessica Jones'', ''Luke Cage'', ''Iron Fist'', ''The Punisher'' and ''Daredevil'' is my favorite of them. I was always looking forward to see the episodes when I have time after work.

I don't want to tell anything on this trilogy Master-Piece but I'm really sad they cancelled this show but at least it ended with a perfect trilogy of seasons so I suggest you to watch this because Its what I think it is the greatest Marvel adaptation of all time."
Save daredevil. Don't let one of the best super hero shows of all time (if not the best) die so soon. Daredevil doesn't deserve this fate. He is the one who keeps the city safe so the Avengers can save the earth. Can't believe such masterpiece ends so soon.
"Matt Murdock as a child was blinded by a toxic spill from a crash. He becomes a lawyer fighting for the little guys. In secret, he develops his other senses and becomes the vigilant Daredevil of Hell's Kitchen. Foggy Nelson is his law partner. They defend Karen Page in the first episode and she becomes their office manager. Later, she becomes a journalist. Their main nemesis is master criminal Wilson Fisk known as Kingpin.

It's the first of the Netflix Marvel universe. It's also the best of them. It's a moderately budgeted series geared towards more adult stories. The characters are compelling. The actors really work. It maintains the cartoon action while giving some real world tension to the stories. The first season sets up this pocket universe with a great tone and great start. The second season fades a little. The thirteen episode runs may be a little too long. The third season returns to form as Vincent D'Onofrio takes back the mantle as the head villain. It is as much his story as it is Matt Murdock's story. It does dwell on Dex a little too much as it tries to set up his character. In the end, Dex and Nadeem are not much more than one season wonders and they aren't a draw for the audience. Dex would become another big Daredevil character but the show is canceled before that. With Disney-Marvel starting up its own streaming service, the partnership with Netflix ends after three seasons. It's been a really fun side hustle and this is the best of the them."
"I know it's probably mostly Disney's fault with the coming of their streaming service Disney+ but man, cancelling what is the best Marvel media ever made is the biggest mistake they've ever made.

This show is beyond fantastic. In terms of execution, it's almost flawless, the acting is fantastic (everyone is great, there isnt a single actor who is bad but Charlie cox and Vincent donofrio definitely steal the show, they are masterful), the story is always engaging and the action is on par with the likes of John Wick and The Raid. I cannot recommend this show enough, truly the greatest thing Marvel has ever done."
"Zero CGI,great fighting scenes and choreography,amazing performance by Charlie Cox and finally a normal powered villian with a really nice motivation.Marvel cancelled this beauty to produce trash movies like Captain Marvel.Well done."
"If the tone of this is overly critical, it's only because everyone else seems to be raving about this series. I honestly can't believe the hype it's got - it is distinctly average.

I'll admit I don't know the comics back to front - I'm coming at this purely as a viewer rather than a particular Daredevil fan.

The whole show seems confused as to what it wants to be - it's got intense violence and dark moments, conveying desires to be seen in a Nolan-esque manner, yet there are so many lazy clichés and weak lines that it never breaks from seeming cartoonish. I'm happy with either - I don't mind cheesy - but one has to be chosen.

There were cool moments, some nice set pieces, and the acting was OK. Matt Murdoch, when in that form, is unbelievably boring - he speaks like a video game character clumsily representing moral fortitude. 'Foggy' is your ten a penny comic relief figure - a great role if done well, but this was, again, average. Ben Urich might have been the single dullest character in anything I've ever watched, with an utterly pointless storyline.

Fisk was the worst though. Almost nothing is explained in terms of how he got to the top - there's no particular cunning or charisma - he's just good at punching stuff really hard and looking a bit unstable; he earns no gravitas at any point. There was no menace to him - he comes off more like a really strong autistic kid than genius level crime lord. He has all the composure of a pigeon trapped in a train carriage. Saying 'This City...' quietly through gritted teeth is not deep and thought provoking.

The music was particularly bad - the producers seemed happy to crowbar any over-the-top classical music in to try and coat things in a bit of drama. Nessun Dorma montage? Come on, try a little harder.

I could forgive all of this though, if it hadn't been so...dull. There's a lame attempt to create some sort of 'All The President's Men' style chase that just drags the whole show into a black hole of people handing other people documents. I almost doubt my credential to write this review as I was so bored by anything going on at the Law firm or Newsroom that I basically turned my brain off.

I will say that the fighting was very good - the choreography was incredible. It's not really something that swings me either way, but I did appreciate the effort that went into that.

Overall though, shocked that its being lauded - if the Joker gave us a better class of criminal, we need a better class of hero.

I've leave it on that pseudo-snappy ending."
"After delivering a wonderfully crafted show with Agent Carter, Marvel is back with another one, Daredevil. I love Netflix. They are enjoying good business. I think Marvel is one step ahead according to DC in TV series.

My favorite was superhero series Daredevil. He is lawyer in the morning but he fights with criminals at nights. The fight scenes are quite impressive and realistic. Hallway scene in first season, stairs scene in second season. Enormous scenes!

The show has a great atmosphere and is extremely dark, but it has a couple of jokes fitted around. The characters are greatly acted and the story is one of the greatest stories that has been on TV recently. The supporting cast is very good and characters get a lot of shared screen time, exploring street level hero stuff in ways we haven't seen and providing some real grit and action like never before in this genre.

Punisher and Elektra were above my expectations. I can't believe this surpassed my expectations. The show is perfect, by far the best superhero show to have ever played on screen. This is by far my favorite thing the MCU has produced thus far.

Daredevil is a must watch for Superhero fans, DC, Marvel or both. And I'm sure, you'll enjoy it! 10/10"
"As with Luke Cage and Iron Fist before, the demise of ""Daredevil"", which must been seen as the crown jewel of the Netflix/Marvel partnership gives me the chance to write an appraisal for the three seasons we've received.

By day, Matt Murdock (Charlie Cox) is a principled lawyer who, along with his friend and partner Foggy Nelson (Eldon Hansen) defend the good people of Hell's Kitchen as a public defendant. Once night falls, he takes a more direct approach, heading to the night as ""Daredevil"" and fighting crime in a more literal sense. Both his divergent lives bring him up against Wilson Fisk (Vincent D'Onofrio) a brutal but intelligent criminal mastermind.

Daredevil is really, for whatever reason, a cut above the other shows that have made up this Netflix shared universe. It might be something to do with the quality of people that were attracted to work on it behind the camera. Stephen D Knight and Drew Goddard initially, though Goddard moved on after the first season. The real star of the show though are whomever the fight co-ordinators are. There is at least one glorious corridor battle in each series, with the one in the first season, where the camera pans up and down a corridor as DD battles various goons crossing in and out of the shot being one of the my most memorable TV sequences of all-time.

It might also just be that the character is better than his Defenders contemporaries. Though still powered, heightened senses related to his blindness, he doesn't have the same invulnerability that make Jessica Jones and Luke Cage's battles more one sided affairs. They also aren't afraid to show the damage that the fighting causes to Matt and the toll it takes on his body. Charlie Cox does an excellent job playing Murdock, so much so I really don't feel like I want to see anyone else take on the role if Disney does decided to reboot the series for their own app.

Though they did get to hit some of the characters key points, his relationships with Elecktra, Frank Castle and Bullseye, it still feels like an opportunity missed here to continue to create some great television."
"Those familiar with comics will know Frank Miller's run on Daredevil is up there with the highest points of his career. Other writers, such as Bendis and Brubaker, hit similar highs in their writing of the character. It's something about Daredevil that brings out incredible storytelling, whether it be the downtrodden and persevering Matt Murdock or the gritty realism of the setting in contrast to the colorful heroes that populate comic books, Daredevil has had a history of fantastic luck with having its potential tapped on paper.

Now, that potential has been tapped on the screen. From the first episode you can tell the property has been adapted with love and a lot of hard work. The cinematography is beautiful in every frame. The characters could not have been cast better. If this weren't actually a better deal for fans, getting 13 hours of (excellent) content, I would hope Charlie Cox could front a Daredevil movie franchise. Because he could carry it.

Daredevil has been the star of some of the best comics ever written, so the adaptation was always going to come under scrutiny. But how it holds up against them? This might actually be better."
"Wow. If you are fan of the superhero or action or drama genre, then give this show a shot. This is genuinely the best superhero adaptation since the Dark Knight. Everything about this show is great, the writing is fantastic and the stunt work and acting are of the highest level. And some standout performances from Charlie Cox as Matt Murdock and Vincent D'Onofrio as Wilson Fisk who kill it in their roles. Truly a phenomenal show."
"As a long term comic book nerd, and a huge fan of the Marvel cinematic universe and television properties - I wasn't sure what to make of the proposed Street Heroes development deal with Netflix, especially in light of the history with those characters in film (Affleck's disappointing Daredevil in particular). I was however pleasantly optimistic from the teaser releases.

I am breath taken with the end result. Vincent D'Onofrio is to my mind the standout star and an act of sheer casting genius as Kingpin. The menace and complexity in his voice even when he's not on screen, and the cold, calculating and distant aspect of his body language, and the delivery of his dialogue, shows both the depth of his talent as an actor and the brilliance of his casting. As a long term fan of D'Onofrio - and a huge fan of the king pin in the comic book universe - I'm thrilled at the prospect of his continued involvement with the Marvel cinematic universe.

The sound editing for the series in general, from D'Onofrio's voice overs to the audible representations of the protagonist's enhanced senses is a triumph. It begs to be recognized and awarded. It is perhaps as integral to success of the series as the performance of any of the characters.

Also, Deborah Ann Woll who played Jessica Hamby in True Blood remains equally gifted as an actress, stunning as an aesthetic work of art, and for a moment, just a little bit more naked than she was in her prior works. Which after 71 episodes of true blood with a celebrity crush on her - has to be a acknowledged as part of the reason for my immediate fondness for the series. But as talented as she is, the show would stand as remarkable even without her.

In the interest of fairness, there are some rough moments in the dialogue. The visual effects have moments of awkwardness in the earlier episodes. There is a sense in a few corners of the production group finding its feet. But it does seem to level out (and up) as the story progresses."
"As a comic books fan, I must say he's (Daredevil) one of the most complex characters. I loved it. The characters, story line, fight sequences, scores, production, cinematography, direction, music ,everything was great! Can't wait to see the next season. Season 1 - 8.8 Season 2 - 9.5 Season 3 - 9.3 .

Thank you Marvel, Thank you Netflix, simply a perfect show."
"Marvel's Daredevil made into a series, and did it well. With some of the classical villains like Wilson Fisk, suitable actor to play him. Nice fight scenes and it's an ok and watchable Tv-show! 🇺🇲"
"Good fighting sequence at times. Other that that, poor story, dragged out dialogues, one of worst villains. And the plot - my 8 year old can come up with better than this.

Yet so highly reviewed. One has to wonder why. Being a fan and purely following a hero is understandable. But no fan can succumb to this depth and compromise with seeing their favorite comic character in such a ""struggling to stretch an episode series"".

Sometimes lagging and rushed at other times. The flow in this one is so ridiculous. Daredevil!!! please come and stop this madness!!!

Season 1 was enough torture. No season 2 please."
"Season 1 - 9/10 Season 2- 7/10 Season 3 - 10/10

This show is awesome. It's intense, violent, the action is awesome, and it's well written. I watched this because Disney announced a new Daredevil series so I figured I should see this first, and it's totally worth a watch. Seeing it for myself also lead me to believe that Disney will without a doubt mess their show up. I can't do it very much justice just by explaining it, so go watch it yourself. Also keep in mind that you need to watch Defenders between seasons 2 and 3. It's okay, like a 7/10, but it's only 8 episodes long, so it's not too painful to get through."
Prison Break is a heart pounding thriller that will keep you captivated throughout its entire run. The show is really smartly written where all of the cast and characters are given a chance to shine and they do...the entire cast is terrific! But the standouts are def the two stars of the show...Wentworth Miller and Dominic Purcell who play brothers Michael and Lincoln almost perfectly! I just recently started watching this show again since I haven't seen it since it was originally on back in 2005 and I can say it still holds up and is just as good as when it was on back then. If you haven't seen this yet then do yourself a favor and watch it as soon as you can.
"Prison Break is a story about two brothers. One is Lincoln Burrows (Dominic Purcell) who's on Death Row for a crime he didn't commit. His genius brother Michael Scofield (Wentworth Miller) holds up a bank to get himself out in jail with his brother. He has a plan to break them out, and a host of other interesting characters. Once out it's not over as they have to evade capture as they try to take down a political conspiracy. It's a heart pounding thriller that will keep you captivated throughout its entire run. The show is really smartly written where all of the cast and characters are given a chance to shine and they do...the entire cast is terrific! The first season is obviously the best but the others are still very well done and definitely worth watching. Don't miss this show!"
"If I were to rate the seasons individually, the first two seasons would have gotten a much higher rating. I really liked those, the suspense was held high, there was something at stake there. It really loses its grip (on almost everything) with the end of season 2, to make way for the third season. While watching Season 3, I realized this was more or less a rehash of the first season (though not as good). Still compared to what they went and did in Season 4 ... Season 3 seems like Shakespeare compared to it.

Season 4 goes completely Telenovela on the viewer and while it could have been even more ridiculous, it was enough to almost make me rate the whole thing a 6 instead of a 7. But back to the good things. Season 1 and 2, with great characters and while still some peculiar coincidences, it was really suspenseful and did hold its own. You had some surprises but you also had some things to look forward too. The misdirections worked (the ones you spot and the ones you missed) and the acting was more than decent enough.

Talking about acting, one particular character (a bad/psychotic one) seems to be a favorite. Especially with the ladies and it's not purely for his looks (no offense). Which made me wonder, especially considering the crimes that character committed, why some people were rooting for him. But that's just me I guess, the actor playing him, does a great job and later in the show there is a female ""counterpart"" (sort of).

The show also got nominated for its score (and might have won a few awards) and rightfully so. The theme is really good and sets the tone. Even the advertising break interlude has a nice touch (of course watching it on Disc, you can avoid those). Everyone was making a big deal that this was a network show and not cable. So there is some violence and a bit of cursing, but not as much (and no nudity) as in other shows. But that was never a problem (at least not for my viewing pleasure).

If you can stop at/after Season 2, you might do yourself a big favor.

EDIT: Onto Season 5 then ... and as I predicted 6 years ago or so, became reality. Someone even has a season 6 locked in ... ah well. The latter might not happen, no matter how much quite a lot of fans want this to become reality. And I'm almost surprised no one has ""rated"" my review yet. Then again, there are over 700 - so there is that. But back to the ""final"" (?) season, which picks things up where we left them, but is way better than season 4 - ok that is not really difficult to achieve.

Some things get negated and others (prison sentences) get ""explained"". Also, who cares about ""logic"", yes? Not a real hardcore fan of the show - they will not. So switch your mind off and try to enjoy this romp as much as possible. Luck and everything included - it flows almost exactly like you expect it to. With all the necessary/expected story beats. Nothing much should surprise you here ..."
"My favorite TV-Series ever

S1 is the best season I've ever watched in my life

S2 is Amazing, Alex Mahone was definitely the star of the season

S3 is really Underrated, yeah maybe it wasn't necessary and they could've ended the story earlier but that doesn't mean it wasn't enjoyable

S4 is probably my least favorite season in the series

And I like to think of S5 as an additional mini-season"
"Prison Break is one of the best new series. It's got personality, style, thrills and action. Michael Scofield robs a bank only to be caught and jailed. With him behind the bars he brings a plan to get himself and his brother, who is sentenced to death, out. What few people knows is that Michael is the architect of the prison and so he knows his way around.

The characters are really good. You really get to know them, but just so good that they're still unpredictable. You get to know some of their history and what kind of person they are. The actors does a great job in portraying these characters. I've only seen Dominic Purcell in John Doe, a performance I didn't find that good. However, in Prison Break his potential in shown. He portrays Lincoln Burrows very good. Wentworth Miller also does a great job as Lincoln's brother, Michael Scofield.

The story may seem a little incredible and some facts may be wrong, but never the less it's made quite believable. You believe the locations and the characters and how they behave and react. The story is well written and detailed and it all seems possible. They've managed to give this series kind of it's own style and personality. The basic idea of escaping a prison is old and so you might not wanna call this show original. On the other hand you don't know what else to call it. It is a new twist to an old idea (and a good one I might add) and it is not filled with clichés. It gives a realistic image of what could very well be. At the same time you got the old hero who's out to save the innocent. Yet, Michael is not treated like a hero. He leans more towards being a anti-hero.

The cinematography is great. This is one of those series with it's own unique look. The mood, style and action is well captured in really good looking shots followed by really nice music.

If you should start to watch one new series this year, it should be Prison Break."
"Done with all 90 episodes n never been bored with it! Simply one of the best TV shows of all time! It's a 15 year old show and still fresher and more addictive than others...

Loved all the characters more specifically Scofield, Sucre n Tbag 🔥"

"I have really enjoyed watching Prison Break. This show is Adventureous, Romantic, and a little humor all in one. I do not have many favorite shows, but this one goes right at the top of my list. I am hoping Prison Break will continue airing for quite awhile. Monday nights are always exciting, just waiting to see what comes next, has me on the edge of my seat. The actors and actresses are awesome to watch. The series also has great writers. So I tip my hat to those hard workers that make this show one of the best shows on T.V. Keep up the good work guys and remember you have so many fans that love what you are doing. As I said before, Keep up the good work!!"
Bestesttttttt season ever..Whoever recommended you this never lose the person this is the best show on this planet I guarantee that..
"I love it, it's one of the biggest series in the world"
"The first two seasons of Prison Break are absolutely captivating and incredibly well executed but sadly, like so many other series, the show is dragged on far too long and gradually loses its energy and appeal."
"I wasn't sure how this show was going to be, it didn't look that interesting to me. I thought it looked more like a made for TV movie than an actual series. I decided to give it a chance and watched the premier last night. Let me just say that I'm addicted to the show after the 2 hour premier. This show was great, the acting, the characters, the setting, everything was done top notch. The show is filmed in and around Chicago, the prison they use for the setting was just closed a couple of years ago, it gives it a very authentic look. If you thought like I did(how can you make an entire series out of one prison break?), give it a try, you won't be disappointed. Besides, Fox made an entire season out of a 24 hour period."
"After seeing the commercial I did not strike me as something I wanted to see, but My husband convinced me to sit down and watch the pilot. OH MY GOD, I was so surprised. After seeing that one episode I am hooked. On Monday nights no one in my house can make a sound while Prison Break is on. We absolutely love it, you immediately love the brothers and want them to succeed. You feel that their failure would be your failure, you want to cry with them, laugh with them.. I hope this show stays around for a while. I know that I would never miss an episode. Any one who has not started watching this show, do so now, you will not regret it in the least. You will fall in love with Wentworth Miller, he is a gem."
"My Rating: 9/10

Watching 'Prison Break' is the most addictive TV experience I've ever had, even more so than Game Of Thrones or Breaking Bad - Lost definitely came close but still Prison Break blows everything out of the water.

Truly, the showrunners have done an outstanding job creating and executing this series. This is one of the few shows whose every season is great and is consistent in quality. I truly cared for all the characters in the show, even the bad guys.

I have yet to come across a TV show which is this engaging and this addictive. Please, please let me know if there is anything out there which matches Prison Break. This is the show I judge other shows by and in certain ways nothing has ever come close...yet."
"Prison Break is now on its third successful season and shows no sign of this wonderful drama ending. Prison Break has everything from petty crooks to government conspiracy to crooked cops. One could have never thought that you could make a show about breaking out of jail so entertaining, or could one? This show reminds me a lot of the ShawShank Redemption. I wonder if that movie inspired the writers at all? Even though they could have been inspired, this show is definitely unique. It all starts because Linc (Dominic Purcell) was falsely accused of killing the vice presidents brother, and is now sitting on death row. Linc's brother Michael (Wentworth Miller) robbed a bank so he could land himself in prison to help break his brother out. To do this Michael has the blueprints of his escape secretly tattooed all over his body.

Now Michael has some pretty good luck, what are the odds that he was sent to the same prison that his older brother is at? I would have to agree with Gillian Flynn from Entertainment Weekly When he states, ""Let's pause, laugh, and salute this series for being so well shot and acted that these little dragonflies of illogic buzz us only briefly. (But seriously, how lucky for Michael that he was sent to this particular prison  otherwise we'd be watching him in Leavenworth hitting his head and muttering ''Stupidstupidstupid!'' for five years.)"" It is very convenient that he helped design this particular prison. What would he have done if his brother got transferred or if Michael was sent to a different prison, I bet he would have felt pretty stupid. I am also very impressed that not only does his full body tattoo look good, but it is a map of their escape. Another pretty amazing thing is that he can actually remember what everything means. I don't know about you but I think I might get some things mixed up.

Putting aside the unlikely elements of this entire show, it is actually rather entertaining. It is very suspenseful and you never know what is going to happen next. Also people can somewhat relate with this show seeing how it is not exactly science fiction. Everybody knows that there are innocent people that are sent to prison, and even put on death row just like Linc in this show. So except for the ""government conspiracy"" for some people this show might hit at home, making it very entertaining.

The acting in this show is done very well. I have not once said to myself wow he sucked. From the main characters all the way to the extras the acting has been superb especially on Michaels part. I think his best acting episode had to of been when he was pretending to be insane. I could have sworn that he was not faking his mental illness. Another character that stands out in my head that is a very good actor is Haywire. If I did not know better I would honestly believe that he was mentally insane. He plays this part perfectly and makes his scenes very entertaining.

The graphics and the special effects in this show are not bad as well. From Michael being burned to Linc getting in the accident, it all looked pretty real. I never saw anything that looked really fake. I did see some things that were rather unlikely though. Like when T-Bag got his hand cut off and sewed back on. He was about to get caught so he ripped his hand off to get away. To me I think I might have passed out or at least have to go to a hospital afterwards, which he never did. He just put a fake hand on his arm like it was not going to get infected. Now even though this is a little for fetched it does make this wonderful drama a lot more exciting.

One thing I noticed when I was watching this show is that there is no narrator. There is nobody telling you anything about the show. I think that this makes the show more exciting. It is like it adds more suspense to it. When you have a narrator he/she tells you wants going on and what to think. Two examples of dramas like this are Grey's Anatomy and Desperate House Wives. When you do not have one you have to think for yourself. Therefore your mind is racing with ideas of what is going to happen next.

Even though this show has a few things that are very unlikely to happen, it has a lot of things that are very likely to happen. It has a lot of good qualities to it. It has good acting, graphics, and special effects. It has all the elements of a very entertaining television drama. I would have to say that this is a very good show and that I will continue to watch it."
"A perfectly plotted series showing turn after turn and greatly it's almost unpredictable. Acting of every character is mind blowing. Detailed execution, covering the next move, thinking beyond imagination of the writers, made it one of the best ever atleast for me. Just one drawback was that after 3rd series it seem little stratched somewhere. Rest all, high five."
"what an awesome show! for the first time since 24, a show has lived up to its hype! the entire plot, actors, everything was great.

i know some people will bash anything, but not this. this was awesome.

i cant wait until next Monday.

the scene where Michael took off his shirt to reveal his tattoos, had my entire living room jumping.

my phone was ringing off the hook because everyone i told to watch was doing so, and was reacting the way i did.

if the rest of the season is just 10% of the first night, it will be better than advertised!

fox hit a home run right out of the ballpark with this show. finally a show that is in the same class as 24!"
"Lincoln Burrows, sits in jail and is on his way to experience the death penalty in the near future, because of a murder he is accused of.

But Lincoln swears he is not guilty.

His brother Michael, is convinced of his brother's innocence, which is why he intentionally wents to jail, with the plan to break out again, with his brother.

Prison Break is a good series. Michael Scofield's character in particular is incredibly well written and Wentworth Miller portrays that character phenomenally too.

Unfortunately, at some point the series felt like an almost empty toothpaste tube from which you squeeze the last little bit out with all your might...

But still a 9 from me, because the series kept me entertained for days."
Seasons 1 & 2 - 10/10 Season 3 - 8/10 Season 4 - 5/10 Season 5 - 2/10
"Let me start this off by answering the first question that I, myself, wondered when I first heard about the concept of this show: How do you maintain a show for terribly long that is solely about how a group of people break out of prison, without leaving viewers dissatisfied(you can only keep that kind of thing going for so long). Easy: It's really about a conspiracy. One can argue whether or not it winds up being entirely satisfactory. This is four seasons long, and through the first three, it's consistently excellent. With that said, the last still has great moments, and it isn't downright poor. Also, the ending does a reasonable job of resolving the majority of the plot threads. Frankly, this show is always better when they're working on a plan behind bars. There are a lot of twists(and they tend to be effective, and that goes for the dramatic aspect of this in general), and you're never sure who to trust. The main cast is magnificent and diverse, no two roles have the same personality, though a lot of them are, or become, ""I will go all the way, no matter the cost""-types. Purcell is more a physical impression than an actor, but he works nicely for the part. Apart from him, they tend to perform well, with Knepper especially being spot-on as the psycho Bagwell, an immensely well-developed, and easily the most interesting, character with who the audience has a love/hate relationship. Miller makes a nice lead, and Nolasco, Wayne Callies, Williams, Fichtner, Adelstein, Dunbar and Lyn O'Keefe are convincing. Allman is fine. The psychology is usually sound. FX are well-done, and this is convincing, with good production values. The action is awesome, with car-chases, shoot-outs and well-choreographed escape attempts. This builds tension well, and is quite engaging. The sense of humor is cool, and the dialog is clever and well-delivered. There are smart references to history and mythology. This is entertaining, and the story of it largely well-written, though there are exceptions where it gets excessive, convoluted, and/or difficult to believe. The pacing is fast, and this seldom gets bogged down. There is a final story-line in the last two episodes, which I understand did not air everywhere, though you do not *need* to see them(if you have to get a specific DVD to watch them, I'd advise consulting someone whose opinion you trust, and who has seen the 2; some may prefer the way things are left before them). This has brutal violence, disturbing content and moderately strong language, varying in frequency. I recommend this to anyone who finds what I have described here appealing. 8/10"
Prison break I just watched all seasons and binged watched it as it was really good. There were 5 season in the series and truthfully they should have stopped it at season 4. Season 5 was not needed at all and if you watched the season 4 finale you would understand why. The characters were great in the show and each one of the main and side character's had a good storyline and great character development over the seasons. As I watched each season it definitely felt like you wanted to jump out of your seat at some points but unfortunately for me I was spoiled a lot of scenes because it was all over my Instagram and TikTok. That's how I saw it and wanted to watch it but overall good show 7/10.
"Excellent acting and well written. One of those shows that you can't wait until the next episode and even more credible than ""24"" which, I have to say, this past year got a little out there. It's great and well worth your time.

Wentworth Miller brings a stoic dignity to the role, earnest and steadfast. Dominic Purcell is wonderful as his brother on the cusp of needing to believe his brother will help him. Peter Stormare is creepy as only he can be. And Stacy Keech is refreshing as an atypically concerned prison warden. Nick Santora and Paul Scheuring's writing is spot on and intriguing, leaving you wishing that this was a novel so that the pages could be turned faster. I would encourage any who have the fortitude to watch this show. Pure gold."
"I never paid much attention to ""House MD"" when it first premiered. I heard from a couple of people that it was basically the same thing every episode: Impossible disease to diagnose, House messes with his team, House suddenly solves the case.

But one day when I was bored, I switched the TV to House. And it happened to be the Season 6 finale (titled ""Help Me""). Going to be honest, it blew me away. I did not know what was happening to the characters at the point in the story, but the acting was fantastic. The atmosphere was superb. The complexity of Dr. Gregory House intrigued me. I saw him as a tragic hero (something you find in works of literature) and his tragic flaw was his leg. Not only the physical limitations brought on by his leg, but the mental ones as well. The pain he suffers day by day that lead him to be the man he is. You see House as an ass...but you feel for him, because you know why he's an ass. Also, Hugh Laurie does such a good job with his accent, if I had not watched ""A Bit of Fry and Laurie"", I probably never would have guessed Hugh was British.

""House"" is like a beautiful novel. It has its themes from episode to episode, and it has its overall themes as a television show. It is a work of art, and I hate that so many dismiss it because of its premise in a hospital. I have watched every episode of ""House"" since I first saw it and those were many hours well spent. If you've never seen it...the Complete Series is on DVD now!"
"Normally when I watch a series, I mildly enjoy it and wander through the series mindlessly, particularly with sitcoms. On very rare occasions, a show will pop up that I enjoy the main actor so much I follow him around for a couple years. This happened with House.

Hugh Laurie plays the part so perfectly and does this incredible thing where you absolutely hate him and love him at the same time. You want him to be happy, but you also can't help but feel like he deserves some of the things he goes through.

The thing that impressed me the most about House is the fact that House stays House from the first episode of season one to the last one of season eight. His personality doesn't waiver for one second, and that's a feat in and of itself.

While all of the medical jargon wasn't necessarily accurate and they had a habit of people coughing up blood in almost every episode, I did find it far more fascinating than any of the crime dramas that pop up. That might just be my personal opinion. It did get old the last couple of seasons though. ""It's lupus!""

Probably the best part of the whole show was House and Wilson's relationship. All of my favorite moments surround their crazy shenanigans. Like the chickens. Ah, the chickens...

The worst part is when it's over. You are depressed for a few days. You know a show is good when it does that to you. I wholeheartedly recommend you go watch House."
"Dr. Gregory House (Hugh Laurie) revels in solving the hardest of medical riddles. He chooses his team which changes over the years. Dr. Eric Foreman (Omar Epps), Dr. Robert Chase (Jesse Spencer), and Dr. Allison Cameron (Jennifer Morrison) are the three original underlings. Dr. James Wilson (Robert Sean Leonard) is his only true friend. Dr. Lisa Cuddy (Lisa Edelstein) starts as his boss.

Hugh is a British actor playing an American doctor who has a badly damaged leg. He's a grumpy caustic know-it-all. Too bad for everybody else, he is almost always right. He is inevitably the smartest man in the room. Oh did I mention that he's a drug addict. It's master acting class from Hugh. It's physical. It's accent work. It's character work. It's a great character."
"Let me put it simply. I am a physician, and as an inviolable rule, I HATE medical shows. Granted, TV series tend to be one dimensional, due to inherent difficulties in the genre, but ""doctor shows"" are something I avoid like the proverbial plague.

And then one evening I caught ""House, MD"" and was completely drawn into the show. In House I find the anti-hero that I've been waiting for in a medical show. The guy who knows everything, but is wrong often enough to keep us all guessing. I enjoy the contrast of House and his cadre of young fresh faced colleagues, complete with starched white lab coats, who struggle as much with their professionally imposed constraints, and sense of decorum, as they do with his personality. And, wonder of wonders, the use of ironic and tragic comedy is without peer in what I've seen in the TV world in recent memory. In a nutshell, I really never know what any given character will say or do and it's that freshness that will keep me coming back for more. Somewhere there is a team of writers who actually know their craft, and an acting ensemble that knows how to pull it off. Now I can watch my TV one hour a week........"
"Simply House is the best medical series made or will be! If you happen to read my previous reviews, you will know that I do not like long interviews, in short, House is the best medical series that is integrated in all of its 176 episodes . My rate : 9.7"
"This is my all time favorite television show. This is based on anything that falls within this category, from Game of Thrones on HBO to Stranger Things on Netflix, this is the best of the best. I remember, quite vividly, sitting down to watch the pilot, and I was almost instantly hooked. Here we were presented a medical show with a doctor that did not hide behind social norms, was not kind, but damn it, he would find out what was killing you. He always did, consequences be damned. I have long been a fan of Holmes, the books not the Downy JR. movies, and this show is the next best thing to the great detective. I was deeply sad when this went off the air, but he will live on in perpetuity in my movie collection. House, was Mr. Laurie's crowning achievement in acting and the best show to ever grace my TV screen."
"This show has the potential to be wonderful. Hugh Laurie does an excellent job (and American accent I might add - he's British) as a sarcastic, yet super intelligent doctor. The show has a wonderful cast and the illnesses these patients come in with are very interesting. The acting is brilliant. It hasn't really been about the doctors yet, but it's starting to get a bit more personal. Up until now (the 3rd episode), it's been mostly about the patients, which is what you want in the beginning of a show. The comic relief is that Dr. House has to do work in the walk-in clinic where every hypochondriac in New Jersey comes walking in... his dealing with them is hilarious. And just as additional enjoyment, Jesse Spencer is very pleasing to the eyes. :)"
"Hugh Laurie master of being head doctor, jerk, sophisticated, and quirky! This show is so enjoyable it gives me goosebumps often. House M.D. is so well done very much deserves the 2 Emmys earned. Filled with complex circumstances that are bumpy with many accurate or mishaps but more wins than not throughout. The characters go through a lot which is intriguing and always entertaining! Even the simple patients are always worth seeing. I love the show and all interesting facts around it!"
It is the best medical show I've ever watched. All details in the show took into consideration. And also the cast were very good and done what they suppose to perform. The final episode showed us how hard the show's team had done to make this masterpiece.
"I've watched House from the first episode and really like the show, but one thing it is NOT is a MEDICAL drama, as so many previous posters have said. What it is is a very well-written program that delves into people's personalities and motivations set in a hospital backdrop with the diagnostic dilemma of the week to add interest.

As a practicing surgeon for almost 30 years, I know for a fact that the ""medicine"" seen on House each week bears only the remotest resemblance to what really goes on in a teaching hospital, or even a private hospital for that matter. The writers can't even get the specialties correct-- Epps' character is a neurologist, NOT a neurosurgeon, and would not be performing any type of operation.

I have,however, chosen to suspend reality when I watch the show because the characters are so good (especially Laurie). I do find the Cameron character annoying, but to tell the truth I encounter all these types of personalities daily.

The House character is really not far off the mark of many physicians who have been in practice for years. You really do develop the ability to determine quite quickly when patients are less than truthful, and also what they are NOT telling you. The only difference in real life is that we can't be as tactless as House. The show is actually at its most medically accurate when House is in the clinic.

To sum up, just enjoy the show for the entertainment value, because if you are expecting medical accuracy on the E.R. level, it ain't there."
"It is NOT a mystery show. This show tells you about friendship, love, hypocrisy, being alone, enjoying life on your own, harsh truths of life and MISERABLE-NESS. Altough House saves lives by solving medical puzzles yet this show is about the character evolution. It shows how and why he likes being alone, why he can't love and show likeness to anyone, why he is ALWAYS in pain physically and emotionally and about the most selfless deed anyone has ever done for anybody. This show portrays almost every aspect of life in the perfect manner, not by making superficial hero who is best at everything but by portraying a most screwed person in the world who is far from being perfect. If I can summarize the best character ever in one line I would like to share this dialogue of 13(Hadley).

Dr. Remy Hadley: ""You have spent your whole life looking for answers because you think that the next answer will change something, maybe will make you a little less miserable but you know that when you run out of questions you don't only run out of answers. YOU RUN OUT OF HOPE."
"Watched the first two or three episodes by accident, then lost track of when it aired and missed a couple. Found that I missed that cranky genius doctor detective and his relentless -- even brutal -- honesty. Came back in time to learn why he limps and sucks down painkillers like candy (but I'm not telling you); now he's my new favorite dangerous man, edging out James Spader's self-destructive lawyer on Boston Legal.

I hope this show lasts. Whether or not it does, I know that House will eventually wind up in my DVD collection beside Hugh Laurie's fabulous comedic work in Black Adder and Jeeves and Wooster. This guy really has range!

In case it doesn't last, check it out quick. There's very little else like it on TV today."
"As a ""medical"" show you have here a totally fantastic crew and set: the doctors are all good looking (chesty women and young men with good hair (and a nicely maintained Aussie accent)), relatively young people with all their hair on, and a hospital that seems like it was just recently visited by an interior decorator (lots of orange walls, glass, high ceilings), and is located somewhere that's always sunny (enormous amounts of natural light). There are no nurses, etc--instead our good doctors do everything themselves, including spending valuable time trying to take blood or finding a lost patient. Right. As others have pointed out the episodes are severely formulaic. There are two facets to each story: 1. Fixing mystery illness 2. Bickering with each other/ sexual tension/ House's addiction, lack of sentimentality, or the ironic contrast between his skill as a doctor and his lack of empathy. The plots all go this way: 1. Scene with patient becoming ill. 2. Opening theme 3. House and etc arguing rapidly about patient's conditions; House snaps witty remarks but they settle somewhat on a hypothesis. 4. Hypothetical diagnosis wrong, patient is worsening. 5. Another diagnosis with some more doctor/doctor bickering, and some revelation on part of House's character (he still has a heart, he has lots of pain, etc). 6. Diagnosis brings patient near to death, something must be done, but what?! 7. House gets some clue, and sends junior doctor to patient's home or interrogates family member. Family member cries and/or gets angry /something radical found at home. Risky diagnosis discovered by confident House, but could be win all/lose all 8. Patient is cured. End with showing some part of House's personality (addiction, lack of sentiment, inner anguish, etc).

The initial exposure to Dr. House's personality as a Sherlock Holmsey type of vicodin-addicted character is amusing. While Holmes was usually cold, House is sardonic, unsocial and bitter, and uses sarcastic humour. He also uses dark humour to deflect his interior character, which is supposed have some pain and some loneliness to give his character interest. However, after the umpteenth acrimonious but witty reply, and the umpteenth little scene showing that he isn't completely unpleasant just gets eyerollingly boring.

This is how the majority of episodes play out. Once in a while it's good if you've forgotten how the last episode played out, but I found that watching this show on a regular basis just feels like a huge waste of time."
"Hugh Laurie as Dr. House is my new hero. This is a terrific show with some absolutely great writing. A little over the layman's head as far as medical jargon, but the characters, plot and script more than make up for any questions about a diagnosis. The show is really carried by House, but the team of doctors who work with him add dimension and depth to his character.

Any negative comments I've read about the show dealt with complaints about how the television doctors don't diagnose the way the viewing medical professionals do. May I point out to these people, this is a television show. Please get a grip on reality and watch it for it's pure entertainment value.

I hope this show has a good following and I'm already hoping for, and looking forward to, more seasons."
"This series literally inspired me to study hard and crack the Medical entrance exam, 5 years later here I am with a degree and unexplainable amounts of exhaustion, but it's all thanks to House. After having completed the degree I can safely say that there is a lot of hyperbole and rule breaking as far as the medical aspect is concerned but I don't care, because the story and the acting is just beyond this world. I don't rewatch serieses ever, but this is the only exception to that rule; mainly because once finished I don't bother going back, even breaking bad I didn't rewatch, but this, this is just special."
"This is one of the best, most lifelike medical dramas I have ever seen.

House himself is abrasive and rude and it all adds up so you just like him more. At the start you really don't like House - he seems rude and infantile, but as the show progresses you develop a love for his style.

He definitely saves more people than those doctors who practice medicine by following the rules.

Although he has his problems (addiction/crippled leg) you don't tend to see them - so intriguing is this character. He will stop at nothing to discover what is wrong with his patient - even if he has to break into their home.

The closest medical drama to this that I have seen is ER - if you are into ER, House is a must."
"They say that if you combine a great character with a great actor, you're halfway to a great show. ""House M.D."" seems to do that with most of its cast, but especially Gregory House and Hugh Laurie. House is a snarky, sarcastic, occasionally callous but adorable jerk. He is also the most brilliant yet least well-adjusted doctor at Princeton-Plainsboro Teaching Hospital. Around him are three junior doctors, all three of whom have varied but interesting personalities. There is also his only friend, James Wilson, an oncologist and his superior with whom he has a rather antagonistic relationship. House involves strange, rare and complicated cases with no easy diagnosis, resulting in the spouting of some mind-numbing medical terminology(which I thought was a brave and successful attempt at retaining some reality)and often character-driven story lines. ""House"" has the best writing for any show in America, if you don't believe me just check the ""quotes"" section for samples of dialogue. House had an infarction in his leg, resulting in it becoming painful and near-impossible to move, which made him addicted to a painkilling drug known as Vicodin., which proves to be the source of many problems. House is, for all his imperfectness, a genius, a master of observation which is depicted in his clinic cases as he can instantly detect either and environmental cause for the disease/problem or find some the patient themselves do not know about. He is a deep character, though, and flawed, but likable, making him a cornerstone for this shows incredible success with the critics, though mainstream audiences prove less receptive and prefer to tune into pseudo-romantic, unintelligent trash like ""Grey's Anatomy"", a classic example of catering to the mainstream resulting in distaste from most critics. Why have not even FIVE ratings come for this show? Please rate it, even if your opinion differs to mine, rate it!!!!"
"I've never watched any hospital shows in my life, so no references. But taking into account that the doc on my BD box set of House claims that 80 % of the cases here are from real life, makes it very interesting. The cons is that House is overwritten. No matter how brilliant you are, a guy like House would be fired for very many reasons. But it's a fictional character arc, and Hugh Laurie is incredible good (I knew him only from Blackadder). Unlike other shows, it follows up on stories, like when David Morse as a policeman tries his very best to put House in prison. We care about this guy, even if he is obnoxious, even if his ""bed manners"" is terrible. I'm still only halfway trough the show, but it plays very real, with some heartbreaking episodes. The one with the girl with terminal cancer got me. I think the main reason House works so good, is that our main character is broken and depressed, but uses a wall of sarcasm and insults to keep people of. And his surrounded by some great actors to build a very belivable environment. Must have been a nightmare for the actors to remember the lines. But remember: it's NEVER lupus or sarchoidosis."
"""House M.D."" hit our screens two years ago and could have be lost in the myriad of other medico shows on TV currently. However, the ingenuity of wit seen in the script and the complexity of Laurie's performance has caused this show to rise above the pack! The range of talent demonstrated by the actors makes the show both compelling and simultaneously medically credible. Highly recommended to all who are fascinated by the quirky!

Hugh Laurie deserves a special mention: the flawed Greg House could have become a stereotyped charatcer, but Laurie's background in comedy provides him with the perfect delivery of his cynical lines. When he is teamed with his underlings, Chase, Foreman and Cameron and charaacters such as Cuddy and the ever-important Stacy, ""House M.D."" proves that it is worth the hype in the media currently."
"'House' is like a breath of fresh air to television screens. It's an intelligent show complete with solid, interesting characters in a sea of bland, predictable and repetitive shows that bombard the airwaves. The show revolves around diagnostician Doctor Gregory House, a bitter and antisocial cynic whose heightened intelligence leaves him with little patience for most people around him. On the surface, he has little interest in patients and instead it is solving the puzzle of their ailment that draws him in but we see many subtle instances which prove he does have a heart for both his patients and his friends. Reeling him in are his best friend Doctor James Wilson, who sees House as fulfilling his need to be needed, and his boss Doctor Lisa Cuddy, one of the few who can give House as good as he dishes out in terms of insults. Training under House as his fellows are Robert Chase, Allison Cameron and Eric Foreman, who all realise what a trial their job (or rather, their boss) can be at times.

Hugh Laurie, in the title role of House, is absolutely perfect. He is able to depict House's startlingly genius IQ that is intertwined with his childishness and sullenness, which, in turn, hide the fact he does care for his patients and those close to him. As such, he turns what could have been an detestable character into one the audience can like. Robert Sean Leonard also delivers a strong performance as Wilson in a manner that shows the character's kindly yet, at times, manipulative nature. The chemistry between Laurie and Leonard is excellent, which is essential in portraying the complex friendship between House and Wilson. Lisa Edelstein, as Cuddy, excels in playing the school marm to the eight-year-old boy House can be without comprising the deeper attributes of the character. Jennifer Morrison, Jesse Spencer and Omar Epps, as House's three fellows, also shine through in displaying the individual traits of their characters and how each interact differently with House.

One of the first things that drew me into the show was the sarcastic humour. Almost everything that comes out of House is humorous, even if it does make the person he is speaking to cry! House is a true anti-hero, inherently a good guy but is willing to do whatever it takes to solve his puzzle regardless of patients' views and colleagues' opinions. The character probably has also done more for disability awareness (House walks with a limp and is in chronic pain after suffering an infarction to his right thigh) than any PC government campaign. Here we have a show that isn't afraid to depict a disabled person acting like an arrogant oaf at times instead of being as some sort of glowing hero and example to us all, as most shows enjoy doing when portraying a character with disabilities.

The show is more like a detective drama along the lines of 'Law and Order' with medicine as opposed to a purely medical show like 'ER'. As such, there is more time dedicated to development of the characters as they go about trying to cure their patient. Everything is portrayed in a darker adult manner and there isn't too much focus on romance (which can ruin a show). Story lines are meaningful and involving, with no softly option taken in showing the realities of life and death. That said, the medical aspects on the show are almost always realistic.

'House' is a highly recommended show for those looking for something put together with intelligence and adult characters who act like adults instead of over-grown adolescent children in high school. Long may it continue!"
"First of all, I think series creator David Shore has done something very cool here. He's taken Sherlock Holmes and plopped him right into a high-stress job in the 21st century. Shore has said House is modeled strongly after Holmes, and this is definitely clear in a lot of House's dialog and mannerisms (especially in his conversations with Dr. Wilson). He and Hugh Laurie have done a better job creating a modern, believable version of the character than most other attempts I've seen (""Law and Order: Criminal Intent"" comes to mind).

Also, although I love Laurie's performance, it could get annoying if it was just a one-man show (again: ""LAO: CI""), and Shore has wisely surrounded him with a large cast of characters to make things more interesting. Each character adds something to the show, and it's very entertaining to see all the different personalities bouncing off each other (and ultimately, bouncing off House). My one complaint is that character development has been a little slow (especially with Chase), and if they don't branch out in that area, things could get stale.

Finally, I've heard some people criticize this show for being too unrealistic, but all I can say to that is, it's not supposed to be (what mystery show is!?). Yeah, the diseases patients come in with are totally off-the-wall, and House diagnoses and cures them in unrealistic ways, but if they were coming in with commonplace diseases, they'd get cured in 5 minutes and there wouldn't be a show! If you can manage to suspend your disbelief and think of it as a character-based mystery show (and can handle some of the graphic surgery scenes), you're bound to enjoy it."
"It has everything: drama, great dialogue and great acting and lots of sarcasm from Dr. House. If you haven't seen it yet, I'll recommend you do it. I found it again in the free subscription of peacock tv."
"When this show was originally on, I could not stand it. House is such an obnoxious, rude, and nasty person that I could not imagine working with him for more than ten minutes.

Now years later, I am off cable TV and watching streaming IMDb and rediscovered House. Even though I still wish somebody would beat him up at least once every five episodes, it is an incredibly well-written show.

The only thing that I do not like is that it seems like the writers always want to push House into more trouble, like he is a negative-attention-magnet. I would have liked the show more if it was not all about what a major jerk House is. The stories and the supporting characters deserved more attention than House."
"Some TV shows have a structure such that you can tell almost from the beginning how long the show has to live. As much as I loved ""Scrubs"", that show was built around a few core characters, and once their stories were played out, that was pretty much be the end of that show. ""Cheers"" basically had a double length of life due to the fact it was actually two shows instead of one - the first 5 seasons with Diane and the last 6 seasons with Rebecca as the female lead. ""ER"" is different. It has a large cast of constantly revolving characters, and the story lines will always be there as long as there is controversy in medicine to merge with the personal drama. Early in ER's history, things were different. George Clooney's character, Doug Ross, was really the star of the show, although they did spread the stories around so that there was quite a bit of focus on the other characters too. This was a successful formula, but once Clooney became a star and a heartthrob he quickly tired of television and longed for the big screen. Thus, starting in season four, he is absent more and more as he goes off to make action films and the show began to look like it was going to suffer from ""Welcome Back Kotter"" syndrome, where John Travolta's success on the silver screen killed that show. After Clooney actually did formally exit stage left, the show changed the formula to its current one of spreading the action around with nobody in particular having the spotlight. I guess my point with all of this is, this is how ER managed to go on a total of 15 seasons, with even one extremely unlikeable character being written in as interesting, even if that one character in particular came to an end worthy of Wiley Coyote.

Highly recommended."
"It's a one time experience, when you decide to binge watch the series, like I did years ago. And was not able to since, because the show's too long and monotonous sometimes. But I had a great time discovering episodes and storylines, that inspired shows like Grey's Anatomy. It was the first of a long series of medical dramas. And to me, none was able to top that. The writing was good, the acting was believable and the characters were all very realistic and relatable to some extent. It sometimes leaned dangerously towards over the top drama, and other soap opera characteristics. Especially near the end of its run. But even that was done in a skillful way. I personally prefer the middle part of the series. And think the most popular aspects of it, like Clooney's rise into stardom. And some of the famous couples, are very overrated. Only the good thing about this show, is how it never dwells on details, and always shows an overview of each situations and day to day life at the ER. Even when it went for a more focused and cinematic approach, it never lost sight of the essential. It's one of those iconic 90s series, that remains of its time, yet relevant decades later. As far as medical dramas go, it's the one that changed TV the most, and should be acknowledged for that."
"I started watching ER on Thursdays in 1995 after my basketball practices. Already at its second season, I had heard a lot of good from the show, but never bothered to see what it was all about. I was exhausted, relaxing on the couch after a good workout and a cooling shower, flipping channels, something I rarely ever do, when my attention was grabbed by the intensity of the scene that was been played out before me. Something to do with Eriq Lasalle's character (Dr. Benton) and his mom or sister, I vaguely remember. Then the emergency room complications, the tension. Blood. Hospital. This must be that doctors show, ER, I thought. Let me see what this fuss is all about, I said to myself, intended to watch at least the end of that show But it was already too late!! I was already hooked. The next week, I found myself driving back faster from my basketball practice to make sure to catch the show again.

Seven years later, I'm still watching (or taping) it every week. Why? Because it's the best drama show on TV, hands down, no contest. I thought at first I was biased because I studied physiology and am pretty versed in the technical jargon and medical realities they face on the show. I have a great interest in medicine and even considered a career in that path at one point in my life. However, the more I watched the show, the more I realized that it's not about the physical traumas, but about the human traumas. The admittedly romanticized, but no less relevant, reality of a profession that deals with life and death day after day, night after night. This is what makes it compelling. This is what makes it of greater scope and deeper emotions.

An ER doctor never gets enough sleep, never gets to go home. Is facing critical situations one after the other. Must make life-altering decisions daily. And yes, also has to cope with his personal life. Relationships, achievements and short-comings.

The setting aside, ER is a show that can boast about serious talent in the writing, directing, acting, casting, cinematography, editing, sound and even the pretty realistic make-up-F/X departments. And I'm talking about top-notch rendition, year after year. Just look at the list of Emmy and Golden Globe nominations over the years. What should also be kept in mind is the genuine appreciation by the public, as demonstrated for example by the People's Choice Award for Favorite Television Dramatic Series for eight years straight.

Created by writing mogul Michael Crichton, this show has passed a host of extremely talented actors that went on to 'bigger and better things', while still keeping the quality and the excitement of interesting and captivating stories told by equally apt newcomers. The style of the show is unique. The humour is witty and often sarcastic (see the purposely unlikable, sharp-tongued Paul Crane's Dr. Robert Romano). The tension is handled impeccably. The death of main characters truly riveting, sad and heartfelt (no question some of the best shows). The personal stories of the nurses and doctors and their work interactions with each other is worthy of a soap opera, but handled with a honest hard look at the twists and turn of life and personal interplay. The directing is smart, thorough. The long continuous takes (with great cinematography work) enables us to feel right in the action and switch from a tense situation to the other. What can you ask more of a TV show?

I enjoy ER and give my hats off to everyone involved with the show. Back in 1994, they re-invented the TV drama genre, upping the level of writing, acting and directing. This challenged the competition at the time and started giving us altogether better drama shows (for the most part). In its ninth season, ER is still the best; it hasn't lost any steam yet. Yes, there has been a lot of changes (actors-characters), but the essence (writers, directors, producers) of what makes the show great is still there and still strong.

When it comes down to it, the daily stress and life-affecting decisions at County General Hospital coupled with the hectic work environment is a place I want to vicariously live in every week. Because, with all the pain and hardness, we understand that these doctors like to help people, but they also love the RUSH."
"I first started watching when I was 14, it was 2002 and season 8. I had been going through a lot at home and this was the first show I'd watched that actually inspired me. The characters weren't perfect and often had complicated personal lives but they were realistic.

This show inspired me so much that I decided I wanted to work in an emergency department and that's exactly what I did. I'm now a nurse. This show is pretty realistic as far as the medicine goes, although I think every medical show is slightly unrealistic as to make it entertaining.

I have seen a lot of reviews that say that the earlier seasons are the best but I'd have to disagree as I think season 7-9 are the best but I thoroughly enjoy the entire show. Even the episodes that aren't the best are still amazing in comparison to newer shows.

I also am a fan of other medical shows such as Chicago Hope, greys anatomy and code black however they do not compare to ER. It is a classic and still translates well even 10 years after it finished.

Definitely worth a watch if you haven't seen it. I think I've watched it at least 5 times from start to finish by now and it still hasn't gotten old and me being a nurse hasn't ruined it like it has a few other shows."
"This show is without a doubt, the best one on television. The one thing that I like most about this show is the atmosphere and setting. Has anyone ever admired the detail put into County General? I think it's great that there is at least one intelligent show on the air.

Not only is the hospital well set up, but so is the cast. All of the characters do a superb job of portraying doctors with the exception of Michael Michele's character. (Sorry if this offends any fans.) The scripts are so well written and I can't imagine writing one every week. Thanks to the writers, producers, etc. for giving us a high-paced dramatic show.

The one thing that I find very unique is that each week new patients comes in with new injuries. With all the episodes they've done over the years, you would think that they would repeat some of their cases, but they don't.

From the scrubs to the trauma, I love everything about the show. With ER topping the ratings chart each week, I will continue to watch and be amazed. I am going to hate to see this show go off the air."
"Alongside The Simpsons, ER is one of the longest running US TV shows and through its successful blend of wonderful and memorable characters, intriguing story lines, strong intensity involving the cast and impressive action sequences, this medical drama is by far streets ahead of the likes of Chicago Hope and even Grey's Anatomy. Unfortunately in recent years, ER has declined in quality due to the departure of key characters, poor story lines and dull ideas, of which accounted for the decrease in viewing figures. The current crop of characters Neela, Luka, Abby, Pratt, Taggart and Barnett don't hold a candle to the experienced old rear guard of Greene, Carter, Benton, Lewis, Hathaway and Ross. They, in particular, were the original, and arguably the best set of characters the show has had.

The earlier seasons of ER were great- those times were witty, exciting and a joy to behold for us viewers. Such a shame however that when the old characters had left- or in the case of Mark Greene passed away- the writers of this drama were unable to fill that void with their newer, replacement characters, as well as good story lines and as such, the programme has suffered as a result.

There were a few story lines I didn't agree with; likewise for example, Mark Greene and Elizabeth Corday getting married together as a couple. I always had an inkling for Mark and Susan, of whom I felt had a lot more in common with each other and considering the history they had together as close friends and work colleagues they had a bond and chemistry that was like a match made in heaven. Also, a lot of ER fans preferred Mark to be with Susan, compared to those who liked Mark and Elizabeth. And so its such a shame that we never got to see Mark and Susan as a couple. There were also tragic and memorable story lines which are worth mentioning also that touched viewers hearts- Mark's brain tumour and his evitable death, Benton's son being mentally handicapped, Weaver coming to terms with her sexuality and coming out as a lesbian to her friends, work colleagues and family, and the consummation of Luka and Abbey and Ross and Carol's relationships.

The main problem with the ER though were the main characters of the earlier seasons who were on the show for a few series, and then suddenly they are written off. It doesn't matter how many new ideas, characters you introduce to the show because it is the original ideas, characters and realism of the show, of which worked so well in the first place that should be further developed. I wouldn't say that ER has jumped the shark, but it is certainly no longer the same show as it was back in 1994. ER is currently in its 14th season and whilst it is somewhat of an impressive feat, many of the original cast have gone and yet it can be argued that in reference to the current season the show has gradually become boring and stale, the longer it has gone on.

As the saying goes, all good things must come to an end- and ER perhaps is no exception. Perhaps now it is the time to lay this ghost to rest. As much as it is arguably the best and most successful medical drama in TV history, ER during the last few years has spiralled downhill; the writing isn't as good as it was and it has lost a lot of its spark, which made it the no#1 hit US drama around. Still, as mentioned earlier, it is still the best medical/hospital drama to ever grace our screens. As not even the classic St Elsewhere and Chicago Hope comes close to matching, rivalling or surpassing ER's accomplishments.

Besides, this show will live long in TV history that's for sure and quite rightly so."
"The best medical drama ever to be aired! It's fast paced, emotional, and suspenseful. The cast is unbeatable. Composed of some of the best actors and actresses Hollywood has ever seen including George Clooney. The show is extremely realistic down to the smallest detail, yet easy enough to understand. There is a lot of drama, but also some comic relief. The characters are all unique and different, but they work well together on stage. The plots and sub-plots are very diversified, but they all tie in somehow. The writing and coordination is incredible. I would recommend this show to everyone, it sure is a change from the warm fuzzies of television!"
"I started watching ER, because I was looking for a new show to watch. I definitely was drawn to the show, and I felt I needed a new show that would keep me interested in watching it all. I haven't ever watched a medical show before, and this is definitely worth the watch. I personally feel that this show is the best medical show and drama show ever! The actors play their roles so well! The drama is definitely emotional and captivating to keep you coming back to watch more. I just love this show, I am almost finished with the show, and I am actually going to go watch some more of it right now! But this show is perfect and definitely worth the watch."
"I think this film series is one of the best television dramas. By far greater than Grays Anatomy and even more than House.

House does have its qualities that do separate itself from this television series, but the themes and the medical concepts and focus is more prevalent in this film series."
"This is the first time that I watch this series from the 90's and surprisingly it has not aged (maybe only in the communication without cell phone). It is impressive the episodes, with handy camera, frenetic pacing, and scenes with interaction of many actors and actresses.

The First Season introduces mainly the lead and supporting cast, showing them as human beings with their failures, expertise and personal problems.

Dr. Mark Greene (Anthony Edwards) is the Chief Resident in the ER of the Chicago County General Hospital, married with a daughter. His career collides with his wife Jennifer´s career of lawyer and their marriage is near to end. He falls in depression after an error of a delivery, when the mother dies.

Dr. Doug Ross (George Clooney) is the pediatric resident and friend of Dr. Greene. Handsome, he is a wolf with co-workers and patients.

Dr. Susan Lewis (Sherry Stringfield) is the second-year resident and also friend of Dr. Greene. She has issues with her parents, has an affair with the unstable psychiatrist Dr. Div Cvetic and is deeply affected by her reckless sister Chloe Lewis (Kathleen Wilhoite), who is pregnant.

John Carter (Noah Wyle) is a talented third-year medical student from a wealthy family that expects to stay at the hospital in the surgery area, which is pending recognition and evaluation of his supervisor resident.

Carol Hathaway (Julianna Margulies) is the head nurse and tried to commit suicide after an affair with Dr. Doug Ross. She is recovering and is scheduling the marriage with Dr. John ""Tag"" Taglieri, who has unrequited love with her.

Dr. Peter Benton (Eriq La Salle) is the second-year resident in surgery that has problems in the relationship with his sister that takes care of their beloved mother that has Alzheimer. He has an affair with her physical therapist Jeanie Boulet (Gloria Reuben), who is married.

There are other characters usually well-developed. The best episode of this First Season is ""Love's Labor Lost"". My vote is eight.

Title (Brazil): ""ER - Plantão Médico"" (""ER - Medical Duty"")

Note: Yesterday (25 Sep 2021) I finished watching the fifteen (15) Seasons of this show and I found it excellent, with a magnificent conclusion."
"The first 9 seasons are amazing, not all the episodes, but the series had heart. But from 10 to 15 was very painful to finish the series. No more medical drama, it's more awful, dummy relationships drama. The writers try to clone the original cast, but they simple failed. The last 5 seasons were start Doctor or Nurse 1 and 2 in a no realistic situation, then relationship, then broken, and repet again with different doctors. The worst characters are Abby Lockhart, Neela and Gates, they can do whatever they want without regrets or consecuences, and always need to be right."
"Having seen virtually every single episode of this brilliant Drama, it is safe to say that those most loyal to it have never been let down by the characters they have watched grow & develop on screen, leaving many saddened at the loss of the original cast, yet intrigued by the new members.

It is true that the original cast of Edwards, Clooney, Wyle, Margulies, La Salle, Stringfield, and Weaver(Season 2)will never be bettered on screen, and the way these seven players turned 'County General' into the most frantic, exciting, emotional buildings in TV history is tribute to them.

Sadly, we have now lost many of them (all but Weaver) yet County still feels like there is all the history of old as well as the new character arcs included.

Visnjic & Tierney do carry the new cast, but it is vital that they do for a while yet, as they are the only real memories that fans have of the older seasons, and i do worry that the cast currently would struggle to entertain so much without them. Yet, introductions of guest characters such as Cheadle & Lequizamo are certainly where the writers manage to find the most interesting characters, and we can only hope that Lequizamo returns next season.

Overall, watch ER....it really is the most developed, and Exciting drama on TV even after 12 seasons, so be watching the re-runs this summer, get yourself ready for season 13 and make sure ER continues to bless our TV screens."
"The Big Bang Theory is one of the more popular comedies of all-time! Every character on the show is almost as equally funny as the others, everyone has their favorites but all are funny. The show keeps it focus on the core four characters and their significant others. You really end up caring about what happens to these hilarious characters. Whether you like this show or not there's no denying that it's obviously one of the most popular sitcoms of all-time, all you have to do is look at the ratings, how much the cast was paid and considering it's on all the time. While I wouldn't exactly put it among my favorite comedies of all time, I would say that it still a pretty fun show. You know the show is popular that when it was ending it felt like it was an end to an era."
"While The Big Bang Theory is far from one my favorite comedies, it's still a pretty funny show that's worth watching. There's a reason it's on all the time and that's because people seem to love it. It's one of those shows where you can have it on in the background while you do other things around the house. The cast (Johnny Galecki, Jim Parsons, Kaley Cuoco, Simon Helberg, Kunal Nayyar, Melissa Rauch & Mayim Bialik) is what makes this show so funny, there's not a bad character on the entire show and all bring something to it. Even all the supporting characters will make you laugh. If you're the one person who hasn't seen this yet all you have to do is turn on your tv because it'll be on somewhere."
"I miss the show when it was about nerdy men nerding over science experiments and awkward women encounters. It then after about five seasons turned into a 'Please the Wife- Soap Opera'.

I hate Bernadette's character and how much she belittles Howard like a strict mother, constantly telling him what to do and making him a puppet to fill her needs. Howard has always been a funny character but being in that relationship made his humour all caged.

Sheldon reminded me of Spock, an awkward intellect who's spot-on logic and obsessive compulsive disorder made it an inspiration even at the weirdest of moments. Although throughout the series you notice Sheldon starts to slowly lose his Sheldon'ness and starts to become more human in a sense. Which made it slightly displeasing to what we loved Sheldon for in the first place.

Penny being the stereotypical sex driven blonde was ok, her beauty made the boys more awkward like nerds would be. Sheldon's intelligence overpowering hers is what also made it funny for social awkardness, him constantly correcting her and her replying sarcasticly showed the difference between the two. Her and Leonard's relationship was not a problem, but when they all had relationships, it became an occurring thing to have at least one relationship problem in an episode and it made the viewing cringy.

The show still has a decent episode everynow and then but it's not as funny as the first few seasons."
"I found the show to be very funny. The laugh track needs to go though. I was afraid that the girl would be portrayed as a really stereotypical dumb blonde. I was glad to see that she is not. Granted she isn't a nerd genius like the rest of the characters, but she is just your average person. There is a lot of subtle humor mixed in with the obvious jokes. Good show and I hope it lasts as there are very few comedies on Television now that can actually make me laugh.

Before 100 people insult my taste, humor is subjective. If you can identify with the subject matter, it is funny to you. If you can't, it isn't. Having worked in Information Technology for over 25 years, I can see a lot of myself and my friends in Sheldon and Leonard.

By the way, if you are my age, you may get the nod to one of the greats of TV comedy in the lead characters first names."
"When my boyfriend tuned into the premiere I thought the show was going to be stupid. I was so surprised. This is the first TV show to really showcase nerds with pretty much dead on accuracy. This has a sparkling cast (Jim Parsons is the new and improved David Hyde Pierce) and fantastic humor that ranges from light slapstick to seriously quick wit. This show is a great love letter to nerds, and as such any nerd should give this a try. With a bunch of new (and very lame) shows debuting, it's good to see something worth watching! This premise isn't exactly new but the execution is nothing short of brilliant. Give it a shot!!"
I don't like it because it's funny. I like it because of the characters. I can identify with several of the characters and can really identify with Sheldon. The people who complain about that the others are mean to Sheldon when he has some sort of mental issues is stupid. I would be happy to have friends like this. Stop complaining and enjoy the show instead or don't watch it if you don't like it.
"There aren't many shows that you can watch over and over and still laugh, but this is one of them. Every actor plays their character to perfection, and the writing is great. I will be really sad when it ends. I just hope Netflix picks it up so I can binge watch start to finish."
"I thoroughly enjoyed seasons 1 to 5 with some of the most intellectually-stimulating and subtle humour since Seinfeld. Like physicist Sheldon ""embracing the chaos"" or using classical conditioning techniques on his roommate's girlfriend. But you did need a modicum of (popular) science knowledge to get the jokes, so apparently by season 6 they rolled out the usual array of mindless comedy writers to turn it into a yawn-worthy series of relationship clichés and rake in more viewers. When binge-watching it, you also notice disturbing patterns like the demeaning portrayals of both the men and women scientists, for different reasons. Grew up around researchers and no, they were not men-children who spent their time at the comic book store. Actually at my Dad's university they were pretty much all stable family types with successful careers, and there were a few loners, too. Like pretty much any group of humans. Lest people think this review is unfair, I have seen all seasons, hoping for a return to the cleverness of seasons 1-5 but alas it shall not be. This is one series that unfortunately will not go out with a Big Bang, but with a fizzle."
"What this review might have sounded like had I written it 7 years ago.

The first few seasons are, for the most part, extremely fantastic, focused, funny, fresh, intelligent and even at times, brilliant...Must see TV!

What this review sounds like now nearing the end of the shows run.

A once great show which slowly starts to diminish around season 4, unfortunately. By the 9th season it seems as though the pen and paper have been handed over to teenage fans of the show...Decent background noise.

To conclude.

This show was once incredible, and something fresh, even at times brilliant. I couldn't wait for each new episode. Now, I watch it when it becomes available on a streaming service, and, on rare occasion you get a great episode, but it's not worth devoting a weekly schedule and sitting through all the fan-fiction episodes and story lines to get to the good stuff. The show can still be enjoyable, without question, though I find it better suited as background noise while doing work instead of must see TV that you're excited to tune in as it airs each week."
"From about season 1-3 of this show, I genuinely loved it! I got a lot of good laughs, and it is definitely pleasing for the geeks and nerds out there of all kinds! And then the show did something it really shouldn't... add more relationships, and focus on them.

From Howard and Bernadette to Sheldon and Amy and so on and so forth, the show just started to become more irritating and less tolerable. Yes Leonard and Penny had relationship problems in the early seasons, but I never liked that anyway. Now it's like they have tripled that problem with adding more couples we don't care about and constantly groan about... Well, at least I do anyway.

Sure the new seasons still have those rare gems every once in a while, but for the most part, it's just seeing episodes with at least ONE of the characters having girlfriend problems while their girlfriends are mostly bitches. That is not what made Big Bang theory great! Now it feels like every other sitcom out there, only with a bunch of nerds.

So, I highly recommend the old seasons and even some of the newer ones, but overall, it's just losing it's edge.

5.5/10"
"I have seen a few episodes of the new CBS sitcom The Big Bang Theory and to me it's one of the best written sitcoms currently on network TV. The scripts are filled with scientific references some people might not understand but they are very witty. Johnny Galecki and Jim Parsons are definitely one of TV's newest comedy teams who have great chemistry and the addition of Kaley Cuoco as their neighbor, Penny brightens up the show. Let's not overlook the supporting cast with Simon Helberg as Wolowitz, who looks a little like Paul Reubens, the man behind Pee-Wee Herman and Kunal Nayyar as their friend from India.

If you watch the closing credits closely, you'll notice that there's a credit saying ""Science Consultant."" It's the first sitcom to employ one. It was a very good idea by the show's creator Chuck Lorre, who also is behind the CBS hit Two and a Half Men to hire one to bring scientific honesty into the show.

I hope The Big Bang Theory is around for several years. It has a solid future."
"Definitely slated to be the best sitcom of this season, this is a creative and funny show. Two geeks have a beautiful girl (Penny) move to the apartment next door. The two geeks have two friends that are even geekier. Here is the many ways in which this show excels: the geeks are lovable and funny and human, not pathetic, you feel for them, the neighbor girl is a very sweet girl, and for once the characters are educated and thoughtful, not the usual ""dumb"" people we see on TV. The dynamics and the dialog between the four friends is fast paced, funny and rich with detailed observations. This is a comedy by Chuck Lorre, the guy who has created Dharma (from Dharma & Greg) so I am fully expecting Penny's character to bloom into far more than what meets the eye. The four male leads establish their personalities in the pilot with such ease that it's clear we are watching a very well written and well acted show. Kudos to the whole cast and the writers. I hope this funny, smart show stays around. We need a comedy with wit and heart, and for a change - lovable geeky brains too."
"I didn't expect much from this show at the beginning of this season, but I have been pleasantly surprised. It has actually become my favorite show this year.

Now, with only one new episode left this season I will miss it over the summer and hope to see it back next year (PLEASE CBS!!!).

There are so many aspects of the show I like. First, I love how various aspects of the nerds relate to the folks I know (mostly in IT). Second, I love how the show flirts with the stereotypes, such as the dumb blond, but doesn't quite go there. Penny is not dumb, and Raj can be quite social if the circumstances are right. The blending of intellectual and ridiculous is also very well done, so that neither is overwhelming.

Keep it up, and keep this on TV!"
"Being a physicists, I'm unsure of what to think of this show; however, the chemistry between the ""nerds"" is terrific! It is great to turn on a show that helps bring me back down to earth. The show may be a tiny bit unrealistic when it comes to how ""nerds"" actually behave, but you don't have to be a nerd to appreciate the science humor. In the same respect, the behavior of the ""regulars"" is a little exaggerated, but is done in such a way which helps accentuate the characters' contrast.

So what is to lose from watching this show?

You WILL be laughing by the end!

(The End)"
"This show is definitely one of my guilty pleasures! Tuesdays are spent anxiously awaiting its posting on iTunes so I can download it, as I live in Canada & don't have cable. TBBT is a trip down memory lane for me, as it IS my high school experience (20+ years ago, I was a smarter Penny). I love the characters, especially Leonard who is adorable, and the smarmy yet surprisingly charming Wolowitz. It has the feel of ""Frasier Goes To College"". I do agree though that they should lose the laugh track - annoying, but not enough to make me stop watching. BTW, very smart of CBS to originally have offered the pilot as a free download or I would never have given it a look. Now I'm an addict!"
"Guys, other than what I have read about Season 10, I personally would like to thank everybody involved to let the characters grow and become more real in their own little Big Bang Universe while all the while they are still so funny. Keep up the good work with the continuous development of the Sheldon and Amy relationship. In many ways they have a lot more than most people do in real life. I can't wait to see Season 11. Stick to the good quality."
"So i've recently come back to this show after having last watched it around 2012 and although it is, on the surface at least, a funny show, it you even remotely concentrate on the goings on, something becomes all too apparent.

This show and Friends work off the same principle, that being - All the characters are toxic, insecure and neurotic.

The entire run of the show is about people constantly looking to get one over everyone else. They're constantly looking to put eachother down at every turn, while looking to assert that they, and their work is far superior to everyone else.

Even once they start entering relationships, all the relationship becomes is a battle for dominance. Each character looks to belittle their partner, while looking to be the dominant one in the relationship even to the point that they'll try to sabotage their partners career just so they can then heap sympathy upon them thereby (for the time being, at least) assert dominance.

They all start arguments out of absolutely nothing. One might say they have a job interview, the other will then make a big deal out of not having been told about said job interview, which then leads to utterly pointless(forced) dialogue which is simply painful to the ears. This always results in the one with the interview saying they won't go, while the other (allegedly) see's the error of their ways an insists they go to the interview, but only if they want to and that nothing will change regardless of what they decide to do. It all gets needlessly contrived.

How any of these characters (in either Friends or TBBT) are friends or married is the biggest mystery of all. If you were to encounter these people on a night out the negative energy emitting from them would open a portal to Hell. They are some of the most toxic and ultimately unlikeable characters in TV history.

The show does though have some genuinely funny moments, but just be sure to switch the brain off while watching it."
"The network that produced such classic sitcoms in the past as ""All in the Family"" and ""The Munsters"" does it again with ""The Big Bang Theory,"" a tremendous success for Chuck Lorre following his drastic failure with ""Dharma & Greg"".

""BBT"" follows the witty and sarcasm-soaked misadventures of Leonard and Sheldon, two socially awkward scientists thrust full-force into standard sitcom story lines-- themes of rejection, friendship, and pride, among others. The important thing is, the standard sitcom story lines feel new for the first time in decades, mainly because the mile-a-minute dialogue now comes with gloriously incomprehensible techno-babble and high-level jargon that could send Kissinger screaming from a room.

It comes down to essentially this. Spot-on writers and directors handle a spot-on cast in spot-on situations. Those of you who are turned off of shows by audience laughter, it adds a much-needed level of reality to this surreally present crowd-pleaser. And when the Writers' Strike ends (still happening as this is being written), fans of great comedy should look forward to much more from this high-potential hit.

Because it all started with the Big Bang."
"I love this show and think it's one of the best new shows on television. It expands upon the ""boy meets girl"" theme. The show features a bunch of ultra-geeky physicists who share an apartment. They are brilliant in the laboratory but totally inept outside of it. In moves gorgeous girl Penny across the hall, and she starts showing them what ""real life"" is all about. I think everything about this show is first-rate, from the writing and performances to the final cut. I hope this one stays around for a while. It certainly has potential. It is worth it just to watch Kaley Cuoco in it. She acts as good as she looks in it.

*** out of ****"
"This show is brilliantly written, has a fantastic cast, keeps you laughing from start to finish of every episode, and shows that even particle physics can be funny. For some of you who may not have seen The Big Bang Factor yet it is a lot like Scrubs if you crank up the geek factor and move the characters from a hospital to a laboratory.

I'm not sure what CBS is doing to promote this series but clearly it is not enough. I heard about this show through a friend and I have never seen a commercial for it ever. I don't know if CBS is trying to keep this show a secret or if their marketing guys just fell asleep at the wheel but this show is fantastic.

The characters, that seem exaggerated at first, are actually believable if you have ever been to a physics conference of any kindor for that matter any comic-con. These ""geeks"" make up an ever growing segment of our population and I think it is wonderful that they finally have a show to call their own. Perhaps I am biased because of my own nerd tendencies but I have had arguments exactly like the ones in this show with my own clique of nerdy friends. To anyone who ever enjoyed math class watch this show and get your friends who didn't like math class to watch too because if they get you they will get this show."
"The big bang theory stands out as a top-notch comedy series, characterized by intelligent humor and well-developed characters. The chemestry among the actors is undeniable, and you're likely to grow fond of Sheldon, Leonard, Penny, Howard, Raj, Amy and Bernadette.

"South Park is probably the most misunderstood show in TV history.

Sure, it does have fart jokes but what it has really involved into is a show that depicts a wide range of current events, pop cultures references, social problems through the lenses of a group of 10 year olds and all the wacky characters that surround them.

The fact that the drawings are fairly simple also makes a lot of people shy away from it, but actually this show has a completely unique approach to several divisive or thought-provoking subjects. To name a few:







These are all great episodes and I think the show if anything has aged well with time.

The other brilliant thing about South Park is that because each episode gets produced in the span of week, it can be more up to date than any scripted show - just this season it referenced Kavanaugh nomination controversy in an episode even before he was eventually confirmed.

Second 10/10 I have given on IMDb and South Park is well deserving of it."
"Initially was not sure as to whether 'South Park' would be my cup of tea at all, despite being a huge fan of animation for all my life (and still very much am). But there have been many instances of films and shows that gave me conflicted feelings before watching, but turned out far better than expected and actually being very good or more.

Such is the case with 'South Park'. As of now, it is one of the highest rated shows on IMDb and was a huge ratings success when first aired, and no wonder. At its best, it's absolutely brilliant and one of the best and funniest shows there is to me. Thought that would never be said about a show known for dividing people with its controversial and ""offensive"" content, was not sure whether I would like it let alone love it and it ended up a favourite. Is it as good as it was? No, it's not as witty, daring or inventive now, but is still very funny and intelligent. That is only being said though because the earlier seasons are so good.

To me, 'South Park' is much better than other popular shows like 'The Simpsons' (originally fantastic, now has declined rapidly) and 'Family Guy' and Seth Macfarlane's other shows, which never did anything for me.

Can actually see though why some dislike it. A lot of the content is very controversial and not for the easily offended. The show is crude, extremely rude (possibly the rudest animated show ever), naughty, at times juvenile and less than subtle in its treatment of taboo subjects. At the same time, 'South Park' is hilarious, smart, witty and daring but also clever, sharp, irreverent and intelligent. The satirical humour is subversive and there are not many animated shows this daring, completely contradicting the tired and incredibly annoying cliché spouted constantly that animation is only for children (often by parents defending a panned family film).

Often one is shocked at how much 'South Park' gets away with, everything. Every subject and every everyday issues is covered and satirised it seems, nothing escapes the writers. While subtlety completely goes out the window, so much of what 'South Park' says has a huge amount of truth and relevance (both when it first aired and still very much so now). Like good satire should it does it in a daring and perhaps divisive fashion, not holding back and taking no prisoners. This should sound like a recipe for disaster, but actually to me it was why the show is so loved and admired.

There's more to 'South Park' than just the humour. The stories are very inventive, smartly constructed, cohesive, honest and relevant. The characters are some of the most memorable and iconic in recent animation, especially Cartman. Trey Parker and Matt Stone's voice work is a practical tour-De-force for both, both bringing so much individuality and personality to these characters and their writing.

Not everybody seems to like the animation, personally liked the quirkiness of it myself and there are not many shows with visuals like 'South Park's'. The music is energetic and catchy.

Overall, brilliant show that surprisingly became right up my street, even with the controversial content. 9/10 Bethany Cox"
"I love this show so much! I think this show has sometimes lost it's edge, but it always managed to get back in the game."
"South Park is one of the most misunderstood, and also the most intelligent shows on television.

South Park is a satirical look on most anything from Western society - politics, the media, today's youth, celebrities, violence in our society, and much much more. However, instead of presenting these issues as they are, they alternately project them through the exploits of four young boys in South Park, Colorado.

Unfortunately, many people take the show solely at face value, refusing to see the intelligence in it - South Park is admittedly filled with racist and sexist jokes, along with other offensive material. The problem lies within the fact that most people don't seem to understand the concept of satire and self parody.

I admit that I, myself, was one of these people - for years I refused to watch that ""garbage,"" until finally a friend forced me to actually watch a whole episode, and I realized that the show was actually making a point.

So, if you haven't done so, go - watch an episode. You'll feel smarter when you're done."
"I wouldn't trade this show for the world. In fact, I love everything about it so much. So many episodes are funny and some even have a dark element in it that just makes it so good. Cartman's funny antics definitely keep the show going. Plots are so random yet so good. The older episodes are definitely the golden ones. I recommend watching them all. Plus,the show is so good it's been going for 26 years. Even the new episodes are funny, but the older you go back the better the episodes are (in my opinion). If you haven't watched South Park, I definitely would recommend it, and I already have multiple times."
"South Park Is the best TV show on Planet Earth. I actually think it's better than Rick and Morty. But, does it deserve a 10? When people who only watch Rick and Morty hear South Park, they think it's a very lazy and crude show (I will be ripping my friends' love for Rick and Morty to shreds). South park is actually the opposite, it is intelligent, funny and in some places heart warming and sad. The characters are perfect, I love Cartman, Kenny, Stan, Butters, Randy and my personal favourite Kyle. The supporting cast are some of the most memorable characters, not as good as The Simpsons. The episodes are some of the most memorable scenarios ever put on television. Hilarious episodes like the zip lining episode, unexpected episodes like the Christmas Critters episode, episodes exploiting people opinions and views on the world like ""Chinpokemon"" and ""Passion of the Jew"", very emotional episodes like ""You're getting old"" and my personal favourite episode ""Raisins"", very dark episodes like ""Scott Tenerman must die"" and the very important ""Osama Bin Laden has Farty Pants"". There's such a variety than Peter Griffin doing something stupid or a wacky Sci-Fi adventure with Rick and Morty. The show has fallen. It's now a very boring show. But, instead of looking at the present, we have seasons 1-17 to rewatch. I have many respects to Stone and Parker for giving us a show that even my mother can love."
"For some reason I stopped following this show long time ago, even before tenth season I think. Recently, again for some inexplicable reason, it came to my mind and I decided to start it all over, from season one, but this time I'm gonna finish it, or better to say catch it, because I hope it will never end. This morning I finished first season. There's nothing better than healthy laughter with morning coffee. After 20 years this season is still fresh and hilarious. One of the strongest tens I ever gave.

10/10

""There is actually a lot of intelligent social commentary here - it's just masked under anything they could possibly offend someone with."" - chthon2"
"Now listen, i'm giving this show a 9 because the previous seasons before season 19 were excellent. They really influenced many other hilarious shows, and part of the fun of my childhood was tuning in to South Park when my parents were gone, only to be caught watching it. But the thing that keeps me from giving this show a perfect 10 is because i think the show has changed for the worst.

So like i said first 18 seasons of South Park we're excellent, even the bad episodes in there still had great memorable moments. I tuned in to Season 19 and i noticed they wanted to do a story season were everything is connected. But that season provided little laughs and the finale was disappointing. I had high hopes for Season 20 because i thought Trey and Matt (the show's creators) had listened to the feedback on Season 19, but Season 20 was even worse then the last one. Many characters went through unnecessary changes, they put so much political topics into the show to the point where it felt like overkill, they managed to make Gerald (Kyle's dad) the most unlikable character in the show, many things that the show sets up are quickly forgotten, and the ending was bad (not disappointing like season 19, but just bad). Season 21 was an improvement from Season 20 but the show was still missing something. And i think i know what killed South Park.

It's no secret that South Park has many political and social commentary tones, but that was never the main point of the show, that was just a good addition to it. But it's like Matt and Trey forgot that, and they made the social commentary the MAIN point of the show.

The sad thing about it is Trey and Matt really want to go back to the roots of South Park, but they forgot how to. They got so carried away with Politics that they forgot that the heart of the show was 4 foul mouthed kids in a small mountain town that find themselves in the dumbest of situations. They completely ditched that part of the show and i eagerly want it back."

(I'm near the end of the 8th season now and it still kicks ass.)

24 December 2018

In the last year I have seen all 22 seasons of ""South Park"" and, although it had its ups and downs, overall it's one of the best TV shows of all time and definitely the ultimate animated one. I can't wait for the 23rd season."
"I remember when these four little boys were nothing but private greeting card art. Now look at them!

In all seriousness, I love this show. This is the funniest adult cartoon there is, and thank GOODNESS Comedy Central took this series and allowed the creators to do ""almost"" anything. If there was an alternate universe for ""Peanuts"", you've hit it in ""South Park"".

There are very few (if none) episodes I didn't like. We all have our favorites, and my number one is still ""Cartman Gets an Anal Probe"". I laughed until I cried on that one. The next one that is very close to that is last years (2002) Christmas Special when Jesus was ""packing"" to rescue Santa out of Iraq after he was shot down. This was one of those episodes where I DARE you not to laugh and enjoy it.

The supporting cast about South Park is also stellular. The lives (and minds) that intertwine with Stan, Cartman, Kenny and Kyle are just hilarious. Chef, Mr. Garrison. Kyles Mom and Dad, Cartman's Mother, Butters, Timmy!, Sherrif Bar Brady, Principal Victoria, Wendy, BeBe, and..Big Gay Al..etc....etc..you name it, they are just too much.

Wonderful and ground-breaking (even though the animation isn't state of the art) nothing is out of bounds for these guys...South Park is an instant classic and a great time to be had by all."
"I read in complete disbelief the comments that called the show racist, homophobic, anti-religious and even one that said it promoted animal cruelty. LOL! There isn't a single race, religion, political group, sexuality, gender, nationality, celebrity etc etc that it doesn't make fun of. The show even pops fun at itself in some episodes, signalling to the world that they themselves are open to ridicule. If you think the show has a nasty message about a certain group then your just not getting it and i'm glad you have ceased watching and have moved on to more brain numbing programmes that don't cause you to think (might I recommend 'Friends')."
"The series follows a group of four third grade boys(later fourth grade) in the town of South Park, Colorado consisting of Stan(The most grounded and ""normal"" one of the group usually characterized by his cynicism), Kyle (The town's lone Jewish child with a strong willed sense of moral and social responsibility), Cartman (a fat, racist, sexist, arrogant loudmouth who goes to great extremes to bring others misery) and Kenny (the oft-muffled and indiscernible one of the group whose interest include pornography or mischief when he's not being killed in an over the top fashion). Each week the group encounter over the top situations usually spawned from a fun house mirror image of a real world controversy or news cycle, with issues such as abortion, homosexuality, economic policy, racism, sexual politics, and many other taboo subjects with edge to spare.

The brain child of creators Matt Stone and Trey Parker, South Park's humble beginnings stem from the creation of two shorts the duo made that served as prototypes for what would become the series (Jesus vs. Frosty). The shorts became early examples of viral media and was spread by notable figures such as George Clooney (who would later have a joke ""guest appearance"" giving guttural dog growls in the episode Big Gay Al's Big Gay Boat Ride). The series almost became a show on the Fox network during their early days having made contemporary envelope pushing content such as Simpsons, Cops, and The X-Files that all pushed the limits of what constituted ""broadcast acceptable"". While executives at the network were initially enthusiastic about the show, disagreements (particularly about Mr. Hankey the Christmas Poo) would end negotiations and shift the duo's efforts to Paramount with a choice of MTV or Comedy Central. Even prior to broadcast the show was faced with poor test screenings and nervous executives, but despite all this the series became a breakout hit generated buzz with taglines like ""this is why the invented the V-Chip"" and becoming a cultural phenomenon prior to airing with $30 million in T-Shirt sales and becoming one of the most watched shows on cable TV at the time and giving mainstream credibility to the network Comedy Central beyond their one respected property Mystery Science Theater 3000 which had mainly niche appeal. In the years since its rough around the edges first season the show has become a pop culture touch stone with many of its lines, characters, and visuals taking on a life of their own becoming cultural icons. The show also is known for its razor sharp bite, fearlessly satirizing politics, culture, society, entertainment, and anything else they can get their hands on.... I only wish I liked and enjoyed the show as much as I respected it.

There's no individual element I can point to as when my enjoyment of South Park diminished as the series hasn't seen any noticeable dip in quality since its first season (in fact the writing and animation has only gotten better and better while retaining its minimalist amateur charms), but more with how and what the show satirized. I can understand and appreciate the show's satire of many elements as being both funny and valid, and even episodes with basic if any satire and more of a humor focus are quite good (The Red Badge of Gayness wherein Cartman tries and almost succeeds undoing the North victory of the Civil War simply so he can win a bet with Kyle and Stan is easily my favorite episode of the series) with the show's attacks on various societal inanities being both insightful and humorous.....but then there's the other times where not only did I feel they missed the mark, they went the complete opposite direction from the mark. Episodes like Butt Out, Smug Alert, Two Days Before the Day After Tomorrow, or Manbearpig are some of the most infuriating episodes of television I have ever witnessed. Butt Out plays devil's advocate for cigarette companies playing up a weird Willy Wonkaish image for the Cigarette companies while showing anti-smoking advocates as a coven of vampires willing to lie and murder. Not only does Butt Out use Cigarette Industry funded ""studies"" to say there's no evidence second hand smoke kills, this episode came out SEVEN years after Jeffrey Wigand blew the whistle on the Cigarette companies and was subjected to threats against himself and his family by third party thugs hired through backchannels by Brown & Williamson and created debunked dossiers filled with lies. There's nothing wrong with playing Devil's advocate, but this isn't Devil's Advocate, it's Devil's Cheerleader! If they didn't read the Vanity Fair article, fine, but there's a bloody movie by Michael Mann (The Insider) that covers it! This same approach is utilized in other episodes outside Butt Out with similar aggravating disregard for reality and utilizing other industry funded studies that of course look favorably upon the industry because if you're grading yourself, why grade yourself anything but an 'A'? And the fact that Stone and Parker don't bother pointing out that falicy in industry funded research shows a remarkable lack of self awareness in two individuals whose careers are built on ""Fearless Satire""

South Park earns my respect because it says what it wants without a filter. Agree or disagree, there's no attempt to paint their words to make them more appealing, and I can respect that. I can respect the show is made in lightning fast time in both writing and productions. I can respect their willingness to tackle subject matter that larger scale productions wouldn't go near with a 40 foot pole. Unfortunately I don't enjoy or get anything from South Park that I'm happy about. Each subsequent season of South Park left me feeling a greater ratio of sadness, anger, and frustration than humor or laughter. At the end of the day, South Park is about looking into the unflushed toilet that is society and meticulously pulling apart the leavings floating in the bowl for no other reason than to see what the leavings are made of and what makes them smell as bad as they do. I can't ding the show for this because that's exactly what it sets out for, and it's exactly what it accomplishes. Do with that what you will."
"It have lost it's charm, it's all bs and weed. Carman is a barely an a-hole and the friends are no longer friends. While keeping this old goodie keep going is great for the passionate fans of the little pricks, I think there must be feedback to ""fix"" the series in the original direction to preserve the spirit of the episodes from few years ago."

Season Reviewed: 10+ seasons

Stan Marsh, Kyle Broflowfski, Eric Cartman and (sometimes) the ill-fated Kenny McCormick are 8-year-old boys growing up amid an adult world in the backward, frozen-over mountain town of South Park, Colorado. Their adventures, that make up creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone's animated comedy ""South Park"", include fending off everything from supernatural demons to the biggest names in the Hollywood intelligentsia. ""South Park"" is several things. It's rude, crude, shocking, smart, decidedly adult, completely original, and it is indulgent in the whims and imaginations of it's creators. It's also the very best political, pop culture and current event satire on television.

The show started as something of a fad - the new vulgar, don't-let-the-kids-watch show on the block. But as real world events changed, ""Park"" evolved along with them. Standing as the kings on top of a soap box they constructed out of swearing kids, talking poo, homosexual hand puppets and hermaphroditic parents; Parker and Stone where blessed with the freedom of a hit series, hip status and a network that gave them the freedom to do whatever they want. As the show aged, they matured in their storytelling abilities and the show went from shock value fad to a barbed satire of American culture.

""Park"" is brought to life with oddly beautiful, vibrantly colored 2-dimensional cut-and-paste animation. The episodes are masterfully constructed. The writing a witty showcase of Parker and Stone's love for pop culture parody, graphic violence, pornography and a bold willingness to take on the hot button issues of the week. It is a free-for-all virtuoso where nothing and nobody is safe, every establishment media position gets flipped on it's head and every politically correct sacred cow gets eviscerated. Now that's comedy - if you can stomach a barrage of extreme scatological humor with your social satire. The vomit jokes and fat jokes on ""Park"" aren't there for the sake of it, but have substance behind them. And nobody does them better.

Eric Cartman, Mr. Garrison and more recently Randy Marsh (stepping up as a reliably hilarious scene-stealer) are classic characters, but Parker and Stone have gone further and developed an entire town of colorful caricatures. They aren't made to be as endearing as those in ""The Simpsons"", but aren't supposed to be. The characters aren't just vacuous idiots, and the laughs of the show come from a very socially conscious place.

Straight men Stan and Kyle are the show's most underdeveloped. They serve mostly as a mouthpiece for Parker and Stone's conservative libertarian philosophy, often literally giving a speech to a crowd in the show's finale. There is not a single other place on TV where you can see environmentalists, the anti-smoking lobby, illegal immigrants, trial lawyers, news media hysteria, elitist Hollywood liberals, abortion, sex ed in schools and every celebrity from Mel Gibson to Paris Hilton all get ripped to shreds. The show pulls it off because it has a unique ability to deconstruct and reconstruct current events better than anyone else (notably Comedy Central's overrated ""The Daily Show with Jon Stewart""), giving them a hilarious or supernatural explanation without moralizing getting in the way of the laughs. They take their own messages to such loony extremes it's impossible to take seriously.The cherry on top is the seemingly endless quality of the original songs provided by the creator's cover band, DVDA.

With a skeleton crew that writes, directs, animates, voices and scores the show, this is independent television in it's purest form. This means it often labors on Parker and Stone's geeky indulgences - episodes center around a full-length ""Star Wars"" parody, the class gerbil making it's way up a human bowel or Timmy, a handicapped student who can only say his name. Occasionally, their shock value execution creates a gagging reaction that obscures an otherwise brilliant point (""Fat Camp""). But I'd rather have a show that challenges me than one shackled to clichés and network mandates. When ""South Park"" goes for the shocking ending, you better believe it actually will shock.

Still, ""South Park"" is almost impossible to recommend in a casual sense. The show is truly an acquired taste, but one I have to come to support whole-heartedly through the years despite (and because) I have absolutely no idea what to expect when sitting down for a new episode. How rare is that? Where so many other shows cower in the corner, begging for our approval ""South Park"" is constantly taking risks and re-inventing itself. We've got terrific stunt episodes, episodes built around one joke or building to a single knock-out punch line. They use the smash-cut ending better than anyone (""There Goes the Neighborhood""). Sometimes the experiments are to it's own detriment and the episode is a 22 minute bore, but even then it's almost unheard of to find a show in it's 10th season that is still water cooler television.

""South Park"" grabs us by the collar, shakes us around and dares even it's biggest fans to come back next week for more. The show is a monument of creative freedom with a wicked imagination, a true (and hilariously funny) sense of comic timing, and an insightful, socially conscious ear that smartly reflects a point of view starving for attention in mainstream television. It is a hugely entertaining, fiercely visceral, fire-breathing, red-blooded American satire made by, for (and most appreciated by) the most jaded and discriminating TV viewers. We just don't have shows like this on TV today. Anywhere.

* * * * * / 5"
The title of my review says it all. This show had great stories for over a decade and then they decided to get all silly and try to have a story arc every year. I have trouble watching an entire new episode now.
"I remember back when ""South Park"" first came out and I thought to myself it was an awful show if only because of the animation. This is definitely something that's grown on me. Many people chastise this show for being mean spirited, but it honestly isn't. I love the episodes where they say that if you're a genuinely good person, it doesn't matter what your (religious) beliefs are. The important thing is to do the right thing and that's something my family always taught me. Contrast this with something like ""Family Guy"" where they say you're an idiot if you believe in God. Trey Parker said that of all the ridiculous things religion teaches, atheism is even worse as it teaches that things happen for no reason. This is a wonderfully original and insightful idea.

It's weird how people can support other shows like Bill Maher. He outright says you're a bad person because of what you think. In this show, it simply says to live your life the way you want because your ideals work for you. Maybe religion will die, but the spirit of love will always live on. While you may argue that ""South Park"" does not have a consistent ideology, you could say the same for the Nostalgia Critic. I'm certain you'll be offended by at least one thing they say. Controversial jokes work great if they're done well. They need to be done with no real spite like this show does. Yes, the show is quite obscene, but it definitely makes you think more than most shows.

It's hard to find a cartoon that is so topical. All you really have to do is just look at the world around you and imagine what the next episode of ""South Park"" will say about it. This is a great example of how pop culture reflects everyday life. The show used to be known for Kenny dying in every episode, but now rarely does it at all. This show has in fact changed for the better and it does treat the viewers with respect. My favorite character would have to be Butters. It's probably because he's the only kid who doesn't swear and he reminds me of how I was in the exact same position as a kid.

Should kids watch this? No. We spend most of our lives as adults so we'll have a lot more time to watch shows like this. It's great that the show is developing more and more of an ongoing storyline. Trey Parker and Matt Stone are great people who want you to accept who you truly are. This show is a great source of entertainment, but might be hard to follow politically. It's nice how they make fun of everyone who exists, but don't resent them. If you think that characters like Cartman are supposed to be loved, you're missing the point. Cartman exists for the role of showing the creators' frustrations towards true bigots. It seems like you're missing out on a lot by rejecting this show, but that's fine. I personally find this to be the funniest and most relevant cartoon ever made. It's certainly dark, but lacks true malice. I do think it's important to make jokes that are relevant to a story, because it's just better written. I'm glad this show has gone on so long. ****"
"This is one of the wittiest television series. Characters are perfect. Voice for characters is so nice that it could not have been better. Eric Cartman bring totally unimaginable, humorous ideas. Butters, Stan, Kenny, Iyke all help bringing up taste to stories. I just love how they make fun of famous celebrities, TV series, movies etc. People might have issues with some of the stories and language used throughout, but if you like comedy with satire and some adult references you would enjoy this series.

I liked the episode based on Warcraft game(season 10,episode 8), if you are going to start watching it you can start with this episode.

Big applause for Trey Parker and Matt Stone the creators of South Park. They also have voiced many characters in the series."
This show is the funniest show I've ever watched and it has the best humour and also very simple animation which makes it even funnier and I love how they're harassing all races but never get cancelled nobody can cancel this show and they don't even have any boring episodes.
"South Park is a great cartoon, even with it's occasional pitfalls every season. It combines satire, music and comedy to create a terrific masterpiece of an animated show. Trey Parker and Matt Stone bring the weekly antics of a inbred mountain town in a way that has never been done before and it is drop dead funny. Sometimes it seems like the seasons get better, sometimes they seem to get worse for some. But episodes like ""Chinpokomon"", ""The Passion of the Jew"", ""Tolerance Camp"", and ""Clubhouse"" are classics. And most episodes get funnier every single time I see it and thanks to Comedy Central giving Parker and Stone full control for language, nothing is out of bounds."
"The writing, the critiques of current events, its all great (for the most part). And the fact that they do it ALL in a week, amazing. The past few years of serialized seasons has been up and down, sure, but overall the show is fantastic.

Quest for Ratings is a sneaky good jab at the tv process and crazy expectations for hit shows and to ""always be original """
"The Simpsons started the amazing world of animated satire, which fell off around the 1990's then a couple years later the first episode of South Park aired fully made out of cartboard and stop motion, tbh the first two seasons aren't as good as the later ones.

The animation is so different then shows like: Family guy, Rick and Morty, king of the hill that the first second you see the animation style you know its South Park and that is what i love about the show it isn't a bad copycat of other famous show (like family guy)

The part where it is so good is that the episodes are made in only 7 days (simpsons takes about half a year and family guy 2 years). (almost) every episode is based around something that is happening in the real world but make it 1000x worse and 1000x as funny.

They make fun of EVERYONE it doesn't matter your skin tone, race, speech, disability they will make fun of you so its in no way racist.

It is satire at its finest!"
"Though the earlier shows were very good and entertaining, their more recent shows tend to be repetitive. The last tended to pertain mostly to pot culture, which was disappointing. However, they seem to recapture some of their initial magic in the quarantine specials. I hope that in future Seasons they will continue this pattern. Though I understand that they are trying to reach new audience members, the show still needs to continue to grow with its current audience."
"I've got a question for all of you REALLY big SOUTH PARK fans: Is this an acquired taste or if you don't get it that first time, you'll never get it? I think I may be the latter because I've watched the show twice and both times it didn't do a thing for me. I just don't think that the show is as clever as Stone and Parker or maybe even the fans seem to think that it is. I saw the part about Janet Reno dressing like the Easter Bunny to get some immigrant children out of a house which aired shortly after the Elian Gonzalez raid . . . tain't funny! I've got nothing against foul language, but that in and of itself isn't funny nor is the fact that it's coming out of the mouths of babes, so to speak.

I WILL say that I like the animation style of the show. It reminds me of those home movies that kids used to send into the TV show ""Zoom"" back in the Seventies. It makes it look as if the show actually were produced by children . . . that is, until they open their mouths. When it comes to adult-themed animated shows, I'll stick with the king: ""The Simpsons"". Sometimes, there is something to be said for subtlety."
"Well, I'm Brazilian and my English is not the best, so I apologize for any mistakes.

I start by saying that one thing I don't really understand is why people lower the rating given to a show just because the last season is weaker, even more being seasons with practically independent stories, where you can abandon the last season if you don't like it, because it will not interfere with the others. My rating here is 9/10 because Fargo brings so many sensational things in the first three seasons that it does not deserve a downgrade due to the fourth season. Especially because the fourth season, despite being full of problems, has some wonderful moments.

Fargo is simply the best TV series I have ever seen in my life. The first two seasons are brutal criminal stories permeated with black humor and coincidences typical of a comedy of errors, but full of philosophical, religious, cultural, political, social, economic and historical references. The third season still follows the same line, but with a little less black humor and comedy, and investing once and for all in the moral, philosophical, religious and even spiritual aspects. In these three seasons we can see the conflict between good and evil, the evil being represented by figures with clear references in mephistoles.

In my opinion, the fourth season lost a lot of the essence of the series, in addition to having a confusing and dragged script, but even so it presented moments of historical and cultural references of great quality, the highlight being episode 9, a masterpiece, all done on top of ""The Wizard of Oz"", ""Alice in Wonderland"" and other children's stories with the theme of a lost child somewhere far from home.

I highly recommend this series and I suggest you watch it trying to capture all the details, like the real natural phenomenon of fish rain, which is shown in the first season, or the Val Johnson incident with flying saucer and the beginning of Ronald Reagan's Alzheimer's in season two, as well as all biblical and religious references, already beginning with the evil speaking of the Garden of Eden in the first season. Oh, don't forget to also look in the independent stories of each season that you are watching for references to previous seasons. Ex: the second season showed you the origin of Mr. Tripoli, Mr. Wrench and Mr. Numbers from the first season, did you notice?

Finally, I would like to praise the excellent work of production, direction and setting of each season, as well as the acting: Billy Bob Thornton, Martin Freeman, Kirsten Dunst, Ewan McGregor, Mary Elizabeth Winstead and Daniel Thewlis are spectacular.

Season 1 - rate 9/10 - Highest point: episode 6.

Season 2 - rate 9.5/10 - Highest point: episode 9.

Season 3 - rate 8.5/10 - Highest point: episode 9.

Season 4 - rate 5.5/10 - Highest point: episode 9 (one of the best in the entire series).

* I wrote this review in 2021, after watching the 4th season, now I come back here almost 3 years later, as I just watched the 5th season: even though it didn't maintain the level of the first 3 seasons, there was already a clear improvement compared to the 4th, which was the most inconsistent of all. Superb performances from a wonderful cast, beautiful photography and soundtrack, engaging characters and a typical Fargo story. The closing episode simply brought tears to my eyes.

Season 5 - rate 8/10 - Highest point: the last episode (10)."
"What can I say about Fargo that hasn't already been said? It's just an incredible series. Everyone has their own favorite season for some reason because they're all amazing. The weak link is easily season four but even that one is still pretty good, as long as you don't compare it to the first three seasons. This is an anthology series that was inspired by the 1996 film where each season follows a new murder story in some Midwest town with a different cast every season. It has the same feel, style, dark humor, unpredictability, etc as the film did. It has the feel of the Coen brothers but creator Noah Hawley definitely puts his own stamp on it. They're making Season 5 now so I'm definitely looking forward to watching that one too."
"You don't have to have seen the original Coen film to enjoy this series, nor does it spoil anything for you if you have seen it: the new TV-show 'Fargo' is entirely its own beast. So far, the only thing the series and the film do have in common is the title and the (fake) premise that both are - allegedly - based on true events that happened somewhere in Minnesota.

The writers (and the actors!) do a great job in creating new characters that are as strange and somewhat over the top as most of the iconic Coen creations we've come to love over the years - and Billy Bob Thornton's 'Lorne Malvo' (from season 01) has the potential to reach cult status. Watching bad situations get worse as bad decisions lead to even worse ones and the lives of ordinary people spiral violently out of control is - I shamefully admit - a lot of fun to watch, and it's told here with such a wicked sense of humor that I've so far enjoyed every minute of it.

The cast so far has been outstanding (this is an anthology series, so each new season will have its own cast and a new storyline) and the production values - especially the cinematography - are fantastic. Now whether 'Fargo' will appeal to a larger audience despite its quirky characters and non-mainstream look the way a show like 'Breaking Bad' did remains to be seen, but I would strongly recommend this to anyone who enjoys black comedies in general as well as pretty much anything the Coens ever did. Great, pitch black entertainment - 9 out of 10 from me.

"Fargo is one of the best and top rated series that's come out in the last few years. It has a great review/rating on just about every website there is (including this one, Rotten Tomatoes, Metacritic, etc.) for a reason and that's because this show is amazing. I know that people aren't as impressed with Season 4 as they were with the first three seasons and even though I agree it's weakest of the four, it's still definitely worth watching. Being an anthology series means they can continue to put out as many seasons as they want without it ever going stale and I hope they do a bunch more. The writing and acting are as good as anything you'll see on television. I really can't recommend this show enough...it's absolutely brilliant!"
"Fargo is an absolute masterpiece and one of my favorite shows all time. This show doesn't have a general rating of 8.9 for nothing.

First the EXTRAORDINARY atmosphere of the Cohen brothers' film, this sensation like no other, which takes hold of us when we enter with the characters into this universe as dark as it is crazy. Fargo immerse you in this special world that is the snowy Minnesota of the Cohen brothers. And more than represented, it is developed here, with talent.

Secondly a stroke of pure and simple scriptwriting genius. To be able to fascinate to this extent, from the first episode, was very strong. And yet. Paced in an almost dreamlike manner, each episode of the series will take its time to reestablish the atmosphere that has disappeared since the previous week, before taking you by the guts with talent, bringing you down with it into the barbaric violence hidden by this snow white and immaculate. Ultra violent, bloodshed is rare, the series preferring to torture its characters psychologically. Lester's evolution (which I feared was a copy and paste of that of Walter White), is more than intelligent. Like i said, the writing is so brillant. An investigation with multiple twists and turns, in a remote town populated by formidable losers, notorious incompetents, methodical and relentless killers, and devious manipulators.

Thirdly the actors. They are all amazing (except those of season 4) but all the credits goes to Martin Freeman and Billy Bob Thorton who delivered 2 performances that are among the best in television and i'm not even exaggerating. Martin Freeman plays a perfect loser to who we become attached quite quickly, he plays on his qualities already known for often seeming to be completely out of sync with the situations and characters he will face. Billy Bob Thomton is absolutely phenomenal as a cold, methodical and intelligent killer. Lorne Malvo is easily one of the best villains of television and i'm still not exaggerating.

Fourth the music. The music is magnificently beautiful and the series is filled with little melodies that accompany the scenes (mainly in season 1).

Fifth this is the best anthology serie ever. Fargo beat true detective because Fargo offers 2 amazing season and 2 ok seasons while true detective only offers 1 amazing season and 1 ok season (season 3).

No episode is too much, everything is orchestrated to perfection, the work absolutely does not lack rhythm and we remain glued to these 10 episodes of very high quality."
"Six months ago I finished watching Breaking Bad and I really think that's the best thing I've ever watched and I always felt it is nonpareil in terms of excitement. From then on I couldn't forget it, I missed it. I started watching several shows later, but nothing came close to BB. I went on a search for such exciting crime dramas and then I saw few people on reddit talk about Narcos and Fargo (most of them) to experience something similar. At first, I googled them and decided to watch Narcos as Google knowledge graph mentions Fargo as a comedy series. So, yeah Narcos was enthralling, but didn't really feel 10/10 especially with too much Spanish. Then I decided to give a try on Fargo and boy oh boy! It's simply sensational.

Season 1: The first episode itself left me exuberant. This Martin Freeman guy, right from the day I saw him as Bilbao Baggins, everything he does impresses me and in Fargo there's nothing less. And the others were excellent too, especially Billy Bob Throtton, that man is really one hell of an actor. He is an assassin, every scene of him is jaw dropping with some chills. All in all, Season 1 of Fargo was really the one I was waiting for these whole 6 months and I didn't want to end this beautiful experience, so I immediately decided to watch Season 2.

Season 2: Everyone who watched season 1 will have some idea about how season 2 will go on. It opened off very well and the first episode here too ends dramatically. The next 2 episodes were slow-paced and I thought this might turn out like True Detective Season 2 as it couldn't really recreate the magic of the first season (just my opinion). So, right when I thought it's sinking, it just gets better and better from episode 4. There won't be a moment you could take your eyes off till the last minute of the season finale. I'm glad they renewed it for the next season and I really can't wait for that.

The music utilized over the two seasons is absolutely mind blowing, the way it relates to each and every scenario is just spectacular. Along with this awesome music, the outstanding piece of poetry depicts the ongoing lives of the people in Fargo. The direction part is really masterful and you can clearly see that in the second season"". It has few flaws but if you're just looking for some real piece of art then Fargo is a must watch.

Update: Ok, it's sad to say that this amazing show went downhill later. Season 3 for me was 7/10 but at least very Fargoish but Season 4 is pathetic and should be ignored."
"(Review updated after Season 5).

Stories generally set in Minnesota, often involving a minor incident that leads to something huge, and multiple-homicidal. In Season 1 an insurance salesman accidentally hires a hitman to kill the man who has been bullying him all his life. In Season 2 a covered-up hit-and-run has major repercussions. In Season 3 a family feud over a stamp leads to a case of mistaken identity and several murders. In Season 4 two crime gangs feud over territory.

Brilliant...for the first two seasons. I was initially sceptical of this series, thinking it was just a serialised version of the Coen Brothers' superb film of the same name. Turns out it's not, but it does have a lot in common with the movie, and this is a good thing.

Creator Noah Hawley manages to capture the atmosphere and central concept of the movie without copying the movie. The plots are different to the movie but have the same pattern: a minor incident/decision that, through misunderstanding and bad luck, escalates into something massive, involving multiple murders. There's the white, cold visual aspect to the movie (being set in Minnesota in winter) which leads to a brooding, desolate feel to the series. Plus, there's the dark Coenesque humour. All this, without the Coens having any creative input into the series: they're executive producers, and nothing more.

This was especially true in Season 1. The season was so true to the feel of the movie I was sure the Coen brothers had a major hand in it (they didn't). Add in a superb performance by Billy Bob Thornton as the psychopathic Lorne Malvo and Season 1 was off-the-charts brilliant.

Season 2 was less intriguing than Season 1 and had a less-tight plot, but had more action. It builds up to this action though and the pacing is superb, building like an avalanche. The last few episodes are absolutely frenetic and riveting. While largely an independent season, the links to characters in Season 1 make this even more interesting. Only downside: the UFOs. They seemed rather gimmicky, added nothing to the story and didn't help the tightness of the plot.

Season 3 marked the down-turn of the series. It has some good passages of play, some interesting characters and a wonderful tie-in with Season 1 but is definitely not in the same league as the first two seasons. The plot is far-fetched, truly testing the series' ""This is a true story"" line. Quite clumsy and disjointed at times, with sub-plots that add nothing except to take up time, a cartoonish villain (and one of the most dentally-unhygienic characters of all time) and plot developments that don't always make sense.

It also feels a bit unoriginal: the ""police officer who sees the full picture but is hindered by the incompetence of their boss"" angle was covered in Season 1.

Throw in some David Lynch-like sequences (often involving Ray Wise, who starred in Twin Peaks) and the season has a style-over-substance feel to it.

Overall, Season 3 is watchable but is a major disappointment after Seasons 1 and 2.

Season 4 is even worse. It started well enough, with an interesting and intriguing setup, but the writers clearly didn't know where to take everything. There's far too many characters and sub-plots and the pace is pedestrian, resulting in an unfocused, meandering, seemingly interminable season.

The writers' keenness to draw things out and lack of ideas is no more demonstrated in Episode 9, an episode that closes off one sub-plot but takes an entire episode to do it when the actual substance of the episode would have taken at most 10 minutes. Plus they throw in heaps of Coenisms to appear reverential and arty and appeal to fans of the original Fargo when all they are doing is padding out the episode. It's also quite ironic, as Season 4 feels nothing like the original film, the remainder of the series or a Coen Brothers production. It's not even set in Minnesota!

Season 4 is also not helped by Chris Rock being cast in the lead role. He's a decent comedic actor but here lacked the gravitas for the role.

When Season 5 was released I was first surprised that I existed, as it had been three years since S4, and then hesitant to watch it, figuring the show had had its day. When I did watch it I was pleasantly surprised. The season is a decent return to form with much of what made the movie, S1 and S2 back: the intelligence , humour, Coenesque plot, characters and dialogue. Plus, the casting and performances have lifted with Juno Temple being quite the revelation in the lead role.

It's not perfect though: the Minnesotan folksiness is overdone, some of the characters are cartoonish and there's a fair bit of filler, largely in the middle episodes. Still, at least it looks like the show is roughly on the right track after losing its way for two seasons.

Season ratings: Season 1 10/10 (can I go full Spinal Tap and give this an 11/10? It deserves such a score), S2 10, S3 7, S4 5, S5 8.5."
"Just finished episode 5 and I'm done. As everyone has said, this is not the Fargo we all used to love. The storyline is not particularly scintillating and I've yet to latch onto any of the characters, other than the nurse and the undertakers' daughter. Disappointed for sure."
"1st season - Good Fargo 2nd season - Best Fargo 3rd season - Good Fargo 4th season - Not Fargo, still watching, but waiting for it to end. Bad screenplay."
"Wow, I remember when this show first came out I was very skeptical they could make an interesting show many seasons long based on the movie. It has the same vibe as the movie, takes place in or around Minnesota has similar characters but is it's own thing apart from the movie.

I just finished watching Season 3 and wow it was a doozy. I love this show, it is rare for me to get into a show where I don't notice the episodes flying by. There is some really strong writing with this show. I won't get into the details but will say you end up really caring about the characters, good or bad you want to see what happens to them. In some cases you are rooting for them to win and in others you are rooting for their demise. A lot of times neither plays out.

I don't normally go for religious undertones in shows/movies mostly because it is kind of cliche the ol good vs evil thing. This season does it a bit but does it well. I really enjoy this show and can't recommend it enough!"
"From the very start, from the opening shot of the cold dark icy road and the background music starting to play, I knew this would be something different, something awesome.

Coming from someone who hasn't watched the 1996 film by the Coen brothers, I really didn't know what to expect. I was in a way wondering if I was just wasting my time and watching a series that would fall short of everyone's expectations and just flop, like so many other TV series do nowadays. However, that didn't happen at all.

The performances were outstanding in my opinion. Martin Freeman was excellent and to my surprise did the accent fairly well. Billy Bob Thornton was amazing as Lorne Malvo, the enigmatic vibe you get from his performance gave me chills.

The cinematography is also one of the good things about this pilot. The shots are smart and intriguing, yet still simple and not too overdone. The music is also outstanding. There are times when it is quirky and funny, there are times where it is tragic and sad yet epic, and then there are also the times when it is intense and mysterious.

Fargo is mysterious, intense, funny (at times), tragic and just simply plain awesome! I really hope there are more to come like this.

10/10"
"Like others here, I recommend you skip season 4.

Season 1 was excellent.

Season 2 was good.

Season 3 was okay.

Season 4 took a dump in its own bed and we had to watch it."
"I really enjoyed seasons 1-3. I found the writing to be very sharp. I especially liked how they tied the storylines together, not only within each season but within the entire series.

That's why I find season 4 to be very disappointing. The writing is tiresome and the characters are mostly plastic. The entire storyline about the black gang is simply stupid and the italian grand is loaded with stereotypes. I mean, Chris Rock as a gang leader? Really bad casting. They even have the terrible Kelsey Asbille who must've had available time between ruining an otherwise great Yellowstone.

There's only two bright spots: Timothy Olyphant and Jessie Buckley.

Stay away from season 4 and re-watch the other seasons."
"1 Fargo is my fourth favorite movie of all time, so naturally my expectations were really high. I'm happy to say that the first season met them. 9/10

2 Since the first season was so good, the second season takes place in the seventies, the cast is unbelievable, the story revolves around two warring mafias, and some of the characters are younger versions of ones that appeared in the first season, my expectations were, again, really high. They were met and surpassed! I'd even say it's better than the film. The only problem I had was when Kirsten Dunst stabs Jeffrey Donovan in the foot, there's an obvious cut. It's nothing more than a nitpick. 10/10

3 High expectations again. They were met, but not surpassed. It was as good as the first season, but to be fair it's pretty hard to top the second season. And it's got Ewan McGregor playing two different characters, and he always does a good job! And in my opinion both Mary-Elizabeth Winstead and Carrie Coon give career-best performances in this! 9/10"
You have to stop at season 3. Season 4 Fargone. Gone is the quirkiness. Gone is the storytelling. Gone is the dark humor. I'm going to rewatch the movie to cleanse my memory of this ordeal.
"Fargo was (WAS) my favorite show. I was bummed when it went missing for a season, worried it had gotten the can, and then so excited to see it was coming back for season 4. Plus, Chris Rock? Cool.

But oh..oh, no. This season of Fargo feels like a completely different show. My husband and I forced ourselves through it, hoping it would get better, that it would start to feel like the rest. We watched half-heartedly until finally we saw the last episode tonight on the DVR.

All I can say is that if they bring back a new season next year, I'll be seriously skeptical of it. I don't know how they managed to blow it so badly.

The ONLY reason I gave it such a high rating is because of the first 3 seasons. Those are totally worth watching. Do yourself a favor and skip season 4 altogether."
"Loved Seasons 1-3. Season 4 was excruciatingly bad. Some of the worst over-acting I've seen in a long time, by too many in this cast. The were a few exceptions, but not enough for me wanting this show over and done by the 3rd episode - watched it to the miserable end just to see how much worse each episode would get. I seriously doubt I'll watch this series again."
"Season 1, 2 and 3 are all 8/10 seasons, but season for brings the whole series down and is only a 5/10 season at best... season 4 has multiple plot holes in multiple episodes and is honestly a disappointment. The only solice is that season 4 isn't connect to the other seasons at all in the story, and so you can just skip season 4 entirely and only watch the other seasons of the series and you'd be much better off that way."
"S01 Simply great S02 Simply great S03 Simply great S04 Boring, really not worth watching"
Season 4 is a complete disaster. I can't even make myself watch it till the end...what was a point to film it under Fargo brand?
"Fargo was one of my favorite tv shows of all time. I've rewatched the first 3 seasons multiple times. In the first 30 seconds of season 4, it is painfully clear, this isn't really a Fargo TV series anymore. Where there was once dark comedy, witty dialogue, and weird violence, now there's more of the political/social lecturing which has infected and destroyed so many great tv shows over the last 2 or 3 years. If you want to laugh and be entertained, I got some bad news for you. If you're looking to be outraged and angry about race stuff, then this your show."
"Season 01: 9.5/10

Season 02: 10/10

Season 03: 07/10

Season 04: Skipped. Thanks to fellow IMDb users!

Overall 9/10."
First three season are A+. Season four gets a F. Don't even waste your time.
"Like most people, I enjoyed the movie enough to give this show a chance. Season 1 was good enough, with some glaring issues but not TOO many. Season 2 was still watchable, but a clear decline in quality. As for Season 3, it has been painful just to get through each episode, and I'm only still going because I very rarely just stop watching something mid season after I've invested many hours in it already. I truly don't even know where to begin, when explaining why the current season has been so bad. Many reviews have already stated how bad of an actor the guy who plays Layton is, but even the characters who were once interesting and often likeable are barely recognizable anymore. Also, the attempts at artistic shots and dialogue fall flat every single time; it feels like a college student wrote most of the monologs. I'm currently on episode 8 of Season 3 and will, at the very least, finish with this season... but not because it is interesting or captivating. Rather, just out of a general curiosity to see where they're going with the show and to confirm my theory that it can't get any worse (even though episode 7 proved me to be painfully wrong already). You've been warned."
"I find my opinion similar to most of the reviews out there. The first two seasons were definitely better than the third. Honestly, I don't enjoy the way they focus on three characters in one episode and then switch to another three in the next. Sometimes, you don't see a main character for weeks. I think this format is one reason why season 3 feels so slow and boring.

Most of the characters lack depth, which I attribute to the writing rather than the acting. Melanie is the only character I find worth watching, and Jennifer Connelly delivers a great performance, as always. I aslo think season 3 suffered a lot because she was hardly present.

I've just started season 4, which we've waited ages for, and it looks like they're sticking with the same format, showing different sides of the story in each episode instead of giving us the full picture. It's too early to tell if there will be any improvement in the character dynamics. I hope they don't continue the pattern of alternating episodes between different settings, one outside the train, the next on the train, and so on. This would be very dull. I also hope they bring everyone together again to face the main conflict, or whatever they have planned for this season. And of course, I'm hoping for more Melanie too. Let's see if things improve.

Update after 3 episodes: layton's character is as annoying as ever.. no improvement there."
"Season 1 review. Will update if needed after season 2.

Not too bad of a show, but has some issues that really drag it down.

Acting is a very mixed bag. Jennifer Connelly does a good job as Melanie Cavill and I also enjoyed some of the supporting roles like Ruth and Miss Audrey, even though most of those supporting roles don't add a whole lot of meat to the story and often feel like underdeveloped, missed opportunities.

While not always or necessarily a bad thing, a lot of characters are one-dimensional caricatures, perhaps more fitting for a cartoon. This works well for some, like Ruth, but not too great for most, like LJ.

There's way too much overacting in general, where the performances of the actresses playing Josie and Bess stand out as pretty bad on average in that regard.

The biggest issue with the acting though, is the lead actor, Daveed Diggs. The guy can't act and he has no presence. His eyes are always empty and he is apparently only able to produce one facial expression. His monotonous voice and inflection also don't match the character. I always see the actor trying to play a character, never the character itself. It really breaks immersion. Massive miscast here and easily the weakest link of the show.

Immersion is broken even more by the fact that his character is all over the place and isn't believable at all in most of the contexts he finds himself in. This isn't a revolutionary leader, but a street corner criminal at best.

He's not even likeable, being that self-righteous smart ass know-it-all (while still failing to accomplish anything), with his unfitting nonchalant demeanor and hilariously large wig.

CGI is mostly well done. Music is good, and I do like the overall atmosphere it tries to create.

The general story is interesting enough to keep me wanting to know what's going to happen next. The first three or so episodes don't make a whole lot of sense in hindsight and I feel the story is a bit too shallow in most of what it tries to accomplish.

This could have been an easy 8 or 9 if the casting and acting would have been better, possibly also while burning through the story a bit slower and not focussing on the rather unoriginal and obvious stuff.

I can't really give this more than barely a 6/10 in it's current form, even though I enjoyed some parts more than that rating would suggest. Will update the score after season 2, if needed."
"Unlike the 1st two seasons I'm trying my best to get through season 3 but boy is it a monotonous confusing mess. Loved the 1st two seasons and was excited to watch season 3, only to be let down right away in episode 1. I will try and grind through season 3 but it won't be easy."
"I always thought the 2013 movie was too short, so after watching the movie i found myself reading the French graphic novel Le Transperceneige, later re-titled Snowpiercer 1: The Escape, created by Jacques Lob and Jean-Marc Rochette, and published in 1982.

In my enthusiasm, I also read the subsequent sequels, The Explorers and The Terminus.

Then years later i come across this Snowpiercer TV series and right from the start i am into it. The first 2 seasons follow the first book loosely with some additions and omissions.

The show starts strong, especially in the first two seasons, with great world-building and solid storylines. However, by Season 4, it slows down, and some parts feel stretched out. Jennifer Connelly and Sean Bean keep things interesting though, with Connelly adding real depth to her character, even when she disappears from the story at times.

Daveed Diggs doesn't quite fit the role of such a major character; there are several moments where his acting feels awkward and out of place.

Overall its a good and entertaining show, better then the movie but worse then the graphic novel series."
"Jennifer Lynn Connelly's acting is phenomenal. I'm literally watching ""Snowpiercer"" just to see her. She's divine. In my opinion, the plot is just great. All and all, I thoroughly enjoyed the ""Snowpiercer"" and I can't wait for season two."
Stop Season 3 and write it again! Script doesn't make sense at all now. Unnecessary and unlogical events to pass time. Layton's acting is getting worse and worse in every season. Jennifer Connelly was wonderful in both seasons and her leave is quickly forgotten in season 3.
"Don't be misled by the reviews. This show is interesting and leaves you wanting to know more about the setting. Is it an award winner - no. Is it entertaining and suspenseful - yes. Does the intrigue make you want to keep watching - absolutely. I read the user reviews before watching but decided to give it a shot regardless of the low ratings because I was I intrigued by the concept. I haven't watched the movie nor have I read the source material. I've now watched 4 episodes and I'm hooked. To enjoy this show you first need to accept that the premise is unrealistic. What it does accomplish is a very interesting analogy of classism. Many people seem to dislike the police procedural plot. I enjoyed it and I think it succeeds as being a plot device to give the audience a tour of the train from the perspective of someone in the lowest class, while showing the massive injustices between the haves and the have nots. Give Snowpiercer a chance if you enjoy dystopian genres and you aren't too picky about technical realism but want something that will make you think about the ugliness of wealth privilege."
"Whoever made the decision to film season 4 with an abundance of close-ups, hand held cameras, and what looks like cell phones in the season 4 opener, really should be forced to sit on an anthill. That's what watching this show is like. The jump cuts, shaky camera work, jeez, what are they thinking. Let me guess, some ""creative thinker"" thought, lets give the show a claustrophobic feel with tight shots. This is what happens when someone surrounds themselves with sycophants who tell them they're geniuses. Or it's the fall back on the back of for a show that is not very interesting and is reaching for something it has lost and can't get back. It's the cinematic equivalent of jumping the shark. It reeks of desperation. This shows camera work is physically painful to watch.."
"I started watching the show and first two seasons were decent even though lead actor Daveed Diggs in the role of Andre Layton is very hard to watch you push through becuse supporting cast is good such as Alison Wright (Ruth), Iddo Goldberg (Benn), Jennifer Connelly (Melanie) and some others. For first two seasons score 6/10 Season three you mostly struggle but you push through score 5/10 and then season four is happening. I started hating myself while I watch the show. They finally fixed Layton hair and that is the only improvement but his acting skills are non - existent. He does not have presence, charisma and he is not belivable to be a strong character, a leader. He is also to feminine to play a role such as Layton. It's a very big problem when you misscast a lead role and you can not fix that. This show was suposed to be canceled after third season. Why did you bring it back ? Final score 4/10."
"The show has so much potential, but the leading actor is just not as good as the show deserved. He's a rapper that hadn't play anything like this before. He's got the same face under any circumstances, proving he's still an apprentice and should give some steps backwards and start from the bottom. It's such a pity!

Wilford actor and Melanie actress simply overtake the show in order to save it."
"Could have been better, lead female is good but lead Male is a little cringeworthy."
"First of all lets make one think clear, this is a show in a sci-fi setting and Sci-fi has always been experimenting with cheesy and illogical concepts. I don't know why people forgot that. Of cource the idea of a endlessly running train isn't realistic nor would the class system of the train work in real life, but thats not the point of the show. You wouldn't say that fighting with laser swords or travelling through time in a car is very realistic, but it is definitely fun to watch. That is why (at least for me) Snowpiercer works. Is it a show that would win awards for groundbraking acting or writing? No, probably not. But the story is definitely thrilling, the set pieces are fascinating and I am extremely invested in the show."
"I wouldn't hire The lead actor (Daveed) only if it would be to jump of the train in first 10sec of the movie. Where did they finde such a bad leading actor? I think someone wanted on purpose to ruin the show and they hiered him as a result. He ruins all the scenes he's in. Top: Spike, Hospitality, Wilford"
"People are weird. Sometime really ridiculous TV series and movies gets very good reviews and sometime decent series gets bad. This TV series is the example of later. It's not an Emmy winning series but nevertheless quite interesting to watch. The actors are doing good job and the plot has some life to it. I am not sure, how come some science fiction movies and TV series, like Star Wars, gets high ratings, despite being quite away from reality but some get judged based on scientific laws."
"The story could be better, characters suddenly change their mood, and the main character acts without thinking, but that's not the biggest problem. The biggest problem is the cast, especially Daveed Diaas, he overreacts in every scene, and that makes impossible to understand his character. On the other hand, Jennifer Connelly acts sensationally, her performance is just so good, and just because of that I continued watching the series."
"For those stating that the premise of a train wrapping around the globe that has to keep running is too unrealistic - that is correct. Though it's a great metaphor for how our class based elitist society is part of a never ending circle that, given the right circumstances , could entirely collapse at any moment.

So no, train like this isn't possible. But that's not the point. Watch the story unfold and if need be pay attention to everything else and let the train part fall to the background. Either way, it's an interesting story and the acting is well done. The scenery is amazingly well thought out , and for a pilot episode they did decent job knocking it out of the park.

I wasn't the biggest fan of the film- but I'm quite interested to see how they do with this. So far, so good.

WARNING - you do need an imagination to watch this show. So if you take everything too literally you won't enjoy it.

The only unbearable part of this show is daveed Diggs- he doesn't sell the part very well at all. The show would be much better without him as a centrepiece: it's a shame they couldn't find Idris or someone a bit more captivating in their acting - Diggs is lacklustre at best and he's outshined by every other character , even the background ones."
"The main actor Daveed Diggs is very uncharismatic and doesn't fit the role. Feel free to skip through most of his boring scenes, and enjoy the gems that are produced by other actors and actresses. I enjoyed Season 2 quite a bit more than Season 1. Well worth the binge."
"The show has potential and seems to be at least similar in concept to the movie, but the male lead actor is just not good. Most of the time he has the same demeanor and expressions without any real emotion. Others are better especially Jennifer Connelly but I keep rooting for them to kill off the main guy. I don't think it's going to happen."
"It's not bad. I gave a 7 with the potential for higher numbers as this progresses. Not sure why others gave such harsh reviews and low numbers. Geeesh give a new show a chance! I never saw the movie, so I have no comparison to offer. For a first episode I'm intrigued enough to want to see more. Isn't that what most want from a pilot episode? Plenty of characters and potential for expanding storylines. The hour went by very quickly and previewed the upcoming season at the end of the episode. If you liked the Hunger Games this seems to be a similar vibe, although more gritty."
"People who've seen this series don't need to be told whether it's good or not, so this review is solely for the uninitiated, i.e. Someone trying to decide whether to invest the time in a seven season series. Here's what to consider.

This was rated, when originally aired, as TV-14 programming, but it is far from your typical YA drivel. It covered a full spectrum of emotional, violent, and sexual content, over its seven season arc. Ignoring the sex, and just considering the human (non-""creature"") body count, I'm amazed at what the showrunners were able to get aired over the course of the series. Bottom line, there's a lot of ""intense"" content throughout the series, and it gets far more graphic in the latter seasons.

Any fantasy, supernatural, or SciFi series fails or succeeds on its ""believability"". I don't mean the plots, but instead, whether the characters project believability. If it ""works"", it will stem from a combination of well scripted episodes, but far more important, a cast that buys into, and fully ""sells"" (110%), their characters. BtVS had all of that in spades. Whether it is their witty banter, a plethora of deeply emotional scenes, or the larger story arcs of the seasons, and/or the overall series, as a whole, these characters are ""all in"", in terms of their commitment to the stories being told, within their ""fantastical universe"".

Throughout the series, there are always multiple (concurrent) story arcs in play. Some, especially toward the end, are even multi-seasonal. Certainly, simply because it is episodic, there is a ""monster (or problem) of the week"" feel, all through the series, but those stories are generally unique and interesting, and many of those play into the larger (and more important) story arcs.

In the first three seasons, the characters are in high school, and many of the plots revolve around that setting (but always with the fantasy-based twist), while the final four seasons move out into the adult world. We basically get to watch these characters grow up throughout the full series arc, and as alluded to earlier, the plots become increasingly more ""raw/intense"" as the series moves forward.

The most important thing is that, even from the first season, it is easy to become invested in the core suite of characters. And, when season two takes what seems to be a somewhat stable set of core characters, and turns their situation ""on its head"", you realize that you cannot count on anything being ""stable"", and consequently, can't really predict what might happen in subsequent episodes (which, obviously, is a ""good thing"", from a story-telling perspective).

Some of the later (especially season 5 and 6) story arcs are heart-wrenching, and easily some of the best ""TV drama"" that has ever been aired. Some of the episodes are also some of the creepiest that have ever been aired. The series is a constant mix of many different storytelling genres, which just happen to exist in the (fantasy-based) ""Buffyverse"". Unlike some series that fizzled out near their end (or simply got canceled), this series really reached its peak in its final three seasons, just continuously ""upping the ante"", until its epic finale. I own the series, and (roughly) every two or three years, I drag out the discs, and re-binge the whole thing, because of ""Buffy withdrawal"". It's always feels good to (yet again) watch it all play out, over the characters' seven year arc.

BtVS is ""not perfect"". There are some episodes that are (IMHO) duds (""Beer"" comes to mind), and there is at least one story arc that I thought had a bit too much silliness, but ""as a whole"", it is easily one of the best TV series, and runs you through the full emotional gamut.

Bottom line, assuming that you ""accept"" a fantasy/SciFi premise in the first place (as you would with a ""Star Trek"", a ""Fringe"", or any similar series), then BtVS is truly a great series (for people of any age... and I'm ""North of 60"", as I write this), and I believe, well worth your time investment.

One major caution: The first two episodes of season 5 are a major ""WTF moment"". During its original airing, some viewers (literally) stopped watching the series after seeing those episodes, and also wrote online rants about their disappointment with what happens (avoid reading the episode synopses to avoid spoilers). Those episodes definitely DO leave you asking ""WTF"", but I would simply say that you MUST have faith, and ""trust your tour guide"" (i.e. The screenwriters), and settle in for the season 5 ""ride"", which, as I alluded to above, is an emotional roller coaster, with an ""unexpected"" season finale that sets up a similarly emotional season 6.

One final note, depending on where you obtain media, and/or from where you stream it, seasons 4-7 may or may not be wide-screen. The latter seasons were shot on 35mm, whereas the first three were shot on 16mm. Even though the entire series aired in the old (narrow) 1:1.33 (original NTSC TV) aspect ratio, and even though Joss Whedon argues that the whole series should be seen that way, I respectfully disagree. I always relish getting to Season 4, where (with my UK DVD versions) the whole series opens up, and fills up the full 16x9 (modern) wide screen. Scenes, and ""people"", that would have been partially ""cropped"" (or shifted) in the narrow format, are simply seen ""in full"".

So, hopefully some of the above is useful, if you are considering the series. It is definitely a unique experience."
"I only started to watch Buffy recently, 20 years after the first episode was aired, got to say I am very impressed. Now remember this is 2017, people are used to 1080p streaming, Blu-ray / 4K video, and HDMA sound quality, 480i, 2 channel sound and 1.33:1 screen ratio are simply not going to cut it anymore. However, in this case, despite the huge technical disadvantages, Buffy still stands out as a serious and entertaining show, one of the best of its kind. The screen-play are well written, characters well developed, dialogues are actually interesting and thought provoking, plus great acting all around. Joss Whedon is a real genius.

Due to the age of the show, I don't know if they will ever release a Blu-ray set, but I can only imagine what a tremendous joy it'd be to watch it on Blu-ray (again). Buffy really sets the standard and example for today's Hollywood, if there is show you can relate to 20 years later, then you know it is not the picture quality or special effects, but the story and acting that speak to you. Comparing this to some of modern day shows, it is clear to me that technical advances don't always improve the quality of a show."
"If seasons 6 and 7 of this seven season show had held up as well as the previous ones I'd give this show an enthusiastic ten. Don't watch the movie and believe you understand the dynamics of the TV show - you won't. This show is a deeply layered exploration of the human condition - man's ability to change for better and worse, the power of forgiveness, the human conscience and its meaning, and how revenge or a lust for power can turn a human into as bad a monster as any real demon.

Season one was a short one and a trial one for the show, thus don't expect that much depth here. These 12 episodes introduce the main characters for the duration of the series - Buffy - the one girl in all the world with the strength to do battle with demons, her friends Xander and Willow, and her ""watcher"" - or mentor - Giles, as well as at first reluctant ally Cordelia Chase and the initially mysterious Angel who both exit at the end of season three for the related show ""Angel"". The episodes are fun and in many ways a foreshadowing of what is to come, but each episode pretty much stands alone.

Seasons two and three go together and are the last two years of Buffy's high school experience. She and her friends graduate at the end of the third season. These two seasons along with season five comprise the best three seasons of television you'll ever see. As for the season two finale - ""Becoming"" - about the best episode of TV ever with one of the most heartbreaking choices ever presented to a 17 year old girl who must save the world but is, after all, also a 17 year old girl. This is where Joss Whedon introduces his ""story arc"" pattern for seasons of Buffy. Each season has a ""Big Bad"" - a nemesis that Buffy and her friends must defeat to save a world unaware of the danger.

Season four was a rather weak one, mainly because creator Joss Whedon was distracted by the creation of his spin-off show ""Angel"", all about Buffy's love leaving Sunnydale and moving to LA. Of course, it would also be expected that moving the show from a high school to college setting would throw the show off balance for at least a few episodes. One stroke of brilliance in season 4 - adding the vampire Spike as a permanent member of the cast. One not so brilliant stroke - IMHO - adding Riley as Buffy's college boyfriend. He always seemed too self-righteous and imperious for his own good. Nobody wants to eat spinach at every meal if you get my drift.

Season five was a return to the brilliance of seasons two and three. Buffy has two real family crises - she suddenly has a sister that nobody seems to notice was not around previously and her mother becomes seriously ill. The Big Bad this year is an uber-strong woman-like creature - Glory - who has a penchant for high fashion and stealing the essence of what holds a person's mind together as nourishment. She's in search of a mysterious key that will unlock the door into her previous dimension from which she has been exiled. Unfortunately, if she succeeds, it will also unleash hell on earth.

During season six, Joss Whedon was again working on another TV series - ""Firefly"". Thus after seven episodes he pretty much left the writing duties to Marti Noxon. Unfortunately, Marti tried to make this season all about an experience she had with a bad-boy college boyfriend and it made for some most cringeworthy episodes of Buffy. The writing suffered too as it became a bit stiff versus the crisp clever lines that just flowed off the cast's tongues previously. However two of my favorite episodes are in this season - ""Tabula Rasa"" and ""Once More With Feeling"". The first has the gang reacting to a spell that causes them to completely forget who they are and their relationship to one another. The second episode is a musical. Trust me, they both work exceedingly well.

Season seven has the theme ""Back to the Beginning"". This has more to do with the name of the Big Bad who is supposed to be the biggest bad of them all but mainly due to rather truncated writing seemed rather lacking in the evil department to the point of being boring. What probably does the most to break up the rhythm of Buffy this season is the arrival of a dozen or so ""Potential Slayers"" who arrive in Sunnydale with Giles. None of these girls are slayers yet. For that to happen the current slayer must die. However, all are potential slayers in the sense that the next slayer will come from their ranks.

I'm sorry to be so vague about the details per season, but I don't want to spoil any of it for you. Watch season one to get a feel for the main characters and then watch season two for the beginning of a storyline that will suck you in for all of the other seasons."
"If I'm having a bad day I can always count on Buffy to cheer me up (or, even if it's one of those cases were I just need a good cry I can always count on Buffy for that as well). It's the perfect blend of so many different qualities...it's humour, action, romance and just incredibly well written, believably flawed characters. I'm not exactly sure where all the haters came from, it's honestly seems to me that this is a case of judging a show by it's title.

There's little I can say about Buffy that won't become redundant, there is not much to find fault with. Sure it's got it's bad episodes, bad story arcs just like any show. But what kept me coming back with the razor sharp wit and characters that became like a family to me.

This is a beautifully written show and if you can make it past the goofy title, fantastic premise and (for many people) the campy first season (You'll grow to love the camp upon re-visiting it) you'll discover one of the best show's in recent memory."
"It is so hard to believe it's been so long since this wonderful program first graced our television sets. Even harder to believe that I didn't get hooked until the fifth season.

I knew of it's existence, of course, but I thought what a lot of people did. ""Buffy? C'mon... Buffy?!? The...VAMPIRE slayer??"". So I discounted it until I was flipping around many, many channels of garbage and stopped on either Spike (the channel) or FX and paused because it was the most interesting thing on.

The episode was Listening to Fear, and although I thought it was a bit hokey, I was intrigued and began to watch regularly. The series was still airing new episodes at the time and even though I wanted to watch those, I wanted to have the entire experience before the finale. As I moved through season five, they aired the final episode and it took all my will not to watch.

Cable television did what cable television does, so at the end of the fifth season, they wrapped and began airing from episode one. I was hooked. No... that's not quite right. You get hooked on ""things"". Buffy was not... is not ""a thing"". This ""mere"" television show and it's wondrous cast of constantly developing characters were real. Honest. They were family, as many have said before.

I miss them all terribly, even though I still see or hear them it's not the same. I watched Repo: The Genetic Opera and I saw Giles. I watched Scooby Doo and saw Buffy. How I Met Your Mother? Willow.

Honestly, this wasn't just a good or even great show. It was an important show. The genius flowed down from Joss and permeated the beings of everyone who worked on the program. As much as I would love to see them all in character once more, I hope it never happens, because magic only happens once and even Joss could not top what he's already gifted the world with.

All I can say is, to Joss all the way down to ""Best Boy"" or the catering service, thank you for the best years television has ever seen. You should all be proud."
"Buffy is one of, if not THE, best dramatic series ever made. People that have never seen the show, or have only seen one episode of it, would probably laugh at that statement. But having seen all 7 seasons of this brilliant series, I feel quite confident in my opinion.

No other show touches on the major issues of humanity this show does: immortality and it's pros and cons, the power of love and friendship, the inner strength we all have within us, and the ability to appreciate life and learn to laugh at the things that get you down. There are moments of happiness, drama, tears, and moments that make you rediscover who you are, and Buffy deals with all of them. Every episode is layered with meanings and insights into humanity, all in some show about a girl who slays vampires.

Seeing these characters change and grow over the course of the episodes is a gift. Unlike other shows, the characters on Buffy are never the same from season to season. The events of the show change them and mold them into new people all the time, that's how good the writing is.

No episode is boring, in all 144 hours of the series there is something worth watching. Some episodes are truly brilliant pieces of television, especially the gems directed by series creator Joss Whedon such as Becoming, The Wish, Hush, The Body, and The Gift. These are some of the best hours of television ever produced.

The writing is spectacular, perfectly capable of balancing comedy, drama, and horror in every episode.

This is so much more than a show about a girl who slays vampires. It can change the way you react to events in your life and the way you view things. It's that good."
"Does anyone else have to defend their love of this show?

I'm a 50 year old British straight man, married with a kid ....and apparently I'm not supposed to like this. According to my 18 year old son anyway.

Maybe I'm wrong.

Maybe the title of the show puts people off.

This is a stand out show.

This show has some of the most creative episodes, characters and moral dilemmas I've ever seen. The show is terrific entertainment but the craftsmanship and the way it is structured is still so very strong... and often imitated.

This show deserves to be held in much higher regard.

There hasn't been anything like Buffy since it aired, and so it lives on, and so it should.

Truly wonderful experience... although no-one believes me.... in my house anyway.

Their loss :-)"
"Buffy The Vampire Slayer, its misguided title put aside, is what I consider, and millions of other devoted fans believe to be a genuine and purely astonishing work of achievement in television history. With creative and daring story lines and terrific character development, the show that began its run on the WB as a mid-season replacement, became a dazzling cult hit resulting in a secure fan base and merchandising for as far as the eye can see.

The show follows a young girl endowed with the ancient powers of the slayer, one girl who fights the forces of darkness, battling alone, relieving the world of vampires and demons. In Buffy Summers' case, after moving to Sunnydale with her single mother, she befriends two loving, but out of place peers, Willow and Xander, who bravely march along side of her. Together, along with her watcher, Giles, they encounter creatures of darkness and strange mystical occurrences, which as a result, draw them closer together and occasionally, set them apart.

On occasion, Buffy is mistaken as a foolish, sci-fi television show which should probably be aired during the depressing Saturday afternoon time slot. But actually, nothing could be farther from the truth. A surprising element to Buffy is that the monsters and demons are a relatively small part of what the show actually stands for. From first love, life, death, sexual experimentation, and self identity crises  Buffy chronicles what it is like to be young person growing up in an overly mature world  with monsters! Between a slayer, a lesbian witch, a carpenter, and a werewolf  anything is possible and welcomed in the Buffy world. With the imaginative and extremely innovative writing of the show's creator Joss Whedon, along with the most intelligent and skillful writing staff that the biz has ever encountered, they were able to produce many groundbreaking episodes including ""Hush"", ""The Body"", ""The Gift"", ""Becoming part 2"", ""Seeing Red"", ""Conversations with Dead People"", ""Grave"", and ""Chosen""  sadly I cannot continue this list for there is not enough space.

Without further ado, Buffy The Vampire Slayer is and will always be an incredible show. If you haven't had the privilege of watching this show, check your local listings for reruns or rent or even buy the entire series on DVD. Without a doubt, you will fall in love with the characters and stories, and by the time you finish the first season you will have welcomed a new family into your lives  sweet and sometimes muddled Buffy, clever and endearing Willow, faithful Xander, perceptive and paternal Giles. This show will linger in our hearts for eternity, and will go on to influence generations of intellectual and audacious writing in television."
"So maybe I didn't like this series as much because I did already see ""Angel"" before this. I find that Angel just has a better story to it then Buffy has. For me it was dismal that Sarah Michelle Gellar was playing the Buffy-character - the first five seasons she just didn't convince me at all. So many times in her fighting scenes it was just to obvious that it was actually a double. The only times when the show gained some momentum was when David Boreanaz or James Marsters where in the mix. To be honest I only kept watching because I wanted to see more of Spike - his scenes are always very interesting...funny so you just can't stop laughing...and just wonderful when he gets really bad - always doing his own thing. And it keeps being a mystery to me why they put Michelle Trachtenberg in the cast. Emma Caulfield is just lovable with her performance - she really adds flavor. So it's going to be a 5 out of 10."
"I was in my 20's and I absolutely loved it!

Now, watching it again in my 40's, loving it, but this time it's because of all the goofs, especially when the stunt doubles are being used...oh and the makeup eg. Spikes scar on his eyebrow🙈"
"After hearing all the great things about the show, I decided to purchase season 1 on DVD. I don't know what I'm missing, but man was I disappointed! I watched the first six episodes before giving up. The plots are ridiculous, the acting is amateurish with being forced and unnatural expressions. And one of worst things about the show is that the plots are all the same. Every episode has the same lame redundant ending. Every show has Buffy defeating some sort of evil vampire or villain with her fake looking stunts. She almost never runs into any sort of difficulties.

The dialog is bland and the acting jobs subpar. The cast members have great deal of difficulty expressing emotion and getting their audiences to feel for them - particularly with respect to Xander. Another thing that bothers me is that with all the principals, teachers, and students getting killed, you'd think there would be some kind of social unrest at school. But apparently it's a regular day at Sunnydale as usual. Truly, you have to be a kid to enjoy this show."
"I have no idea why people are hating on this brilliant TV show. I watched the entire series on DVD and was completely caught up in it my the end of season one. This show stands up over time and does not become outdated. I watched this show thinking it would be an entertaining hour and was shocked to find the show compelling, hilarious, and full of real emotion. The writers and especially Joss Whedon have come up with some of the funniest TV out there, and easily keep your attention for the entire seven seasons. Each season seems to get funnier, and all the characters continue to develop. Anyone who gives this show a real chance will be captured by the Buffy Universe. If you can ignore some of the more low budget demons and instead focus on the characters and emotion of the story you will not be disappointed. BTVH will make you laugh, cry, and fall in love with the characters. 10/10."
"Buffy The Vampire Slayer (BTVS) is a wonderful crossover between the realms of science fiction, horror, adventure, and whodunit. The main cast meet together to solve mysteries and, obviously, vanquish the undead--this earns them the reputation of being Buffy and her Scoobie Gang.

What makes the character Buffy prominent is that she is the exact opposite of the hero these type of television programs and movies popularized previous to this show. Being a slayer gives a girl increased speed, dexterity, stamina, strength, and acuity / alertness of nearby vampires. For the show to explore this unlikely avenue is what gives it the distinction of being completely different from anything before it. Although some might not be willing to suspend disbelief to see Buffy as a heroine, she stands for progressiveness in everyone. Buffy's story has a huge arch that many can relate to, from chosen one to leader.

The show itself is timeless, although some of the early episodes coincide with the advent of the internet and at times you will be watching and yell at the screen ""Use your bleeping cell phone!"" (cell phones weren't used mainstream by teens until after 2000). This show was slightly ahead of its time in some regards, where you may think some plot lines were lifted from something like The Matrix in episodes that were actually released a good year before it hit theaters.

The stories are quite good, and what I enjoyed most about this show is that the writers actually throw a lot of curve balls at you when you might decide what the outcome will likely be. The characters are witty, thankfully, which keeps the dialogue fresh and the plot developing. Although many episodes start with slaying in the graveyard, everything is kept really fresh.

Yes, there are a few episodes that get a lot of recognition but it's the overall storyline and main characters in the show that makes it worth watching. It has won 3 out of 11 nominated Emmys and 9 out of 29 Saturn Awards, with Sarah Michelle Gellar being nominated for a Saturn every season of the show, winning once. You can see at least the first two seasons of this show free on IMDb.com (and elsewhere) at this point, although just a month ago they had the first three. It can be picked up for $15 a season at Walmart, or in some cases in double packs from $20-30 at Walmart/Target."
"I absolutely loved this show! I first watched this years ago and every few years rewatch the show and each time it's such a treat. While not everything holds up, a lot of the basic themes of the show are timeless. Sarah Michelle Geller is such a talented actress."
"Definitely the best of its genre. I watch a lot of TV, collect a lot of dvds and LOVE a lot of shows. To me nothing was more loved than Buffy and although i have current shows i love(Lost,etc) Buffy stands out as the best. After the first few seasons you really knew and cared about all of the characters. And to all those people who say SMG can't act...pleaseeeee, she was fantastic in her part and she became a great role model. This show had its serious side, but also left room for some innocent humour and some real love stories. Some of the characters like Spike for example, will always pop up into my head when thinking of TVs greatest villains.

After over 10 years since it first aired, Buffy is still a must have TV show and Buffy and Angel will always be one of TVs best couples."
"Sarah Michelle's performance across the 7 seasons is in my opinion the very best by any actor in any TV show or film, ever. It is intense, emotional, witty and very believable. Technically and artistically you will not see a better character portrayal. The first three seasons were probably the best, but there are highlights in later episodes. How she maintained such perfection for so long is beyond me - it must require great dedication, understanding and skill.

Buffy TVS is many things to many people, but mainly it is about love and friendship. Buffy and Angel's love story is beautifully crafted and realistically played out, against a rather surreal backdrop. I have always considered the various creatures to be largely metaphorical and mythical in the sense that they are physical manifestations of human characteristics and also take many references from classical literature.

There is no doubt that by accident or design, the creators of BTVS turned what may have been a silly kids' show into a meaningful, involving and everlasting tale about humanity. BTVS should be on the school curriculum alongside Shakespeare, for it is at least as well written, and even more relevant to every one of us.

A brilliant supporting cast around a core of Gellar, Brendon, Hannigan and Head, give lifetime best performances. Writers, directors, set designers, lighting technicians ... just everyone on the payroll ... nobody involved in the making of this show gives less than 100%.

Why Buffy The Vampire Slayer did not gain a wider audience, more awards, and a much longer run is perhaps down to the greatest crime committed in the art of making moving pictures - those pulling the purse strings failed to realise the true worth of the treasures they let slip through their greasy hands.

As long as I live I know that every two-bit TV show that comes along with a wannabee Sarah Michelle, and pathetic production-line vampire rip-offs, will just make me cringe and mourn the passing of Buffy, and of Sarah Michelle who with one or two exceptions has never been given a decent feature film role.

I love and admire Buffy and the girl who brought her to life, and pray for the day when she returns to rescue me from the humdrum banality of living in this world."
"Buffy is series that was not only consistently good, but a series that grew better over time. The first season is good, but not fantastic. It was shorter because the WB was not sure if they would have a viewing base and only had 12 episodes. The second season developed the characters and you began to see the magic of the show. As the series progresses, I am astounded by the writing, directing, and acting. Joss Whedon is a genius of the camera and master of the pen, and anyone who argues with me is fooling themselves. The cast, as well as the characters, matures over time and become living, breathing people that you believe.

In short, if you are considering watching this show, I highly recommend you watch all of the first and second season before making any judgements. Frankly, this is my favorite story of all time. It transcends the TV, and beats out most books, movies, and other TV shows. This show is beautiful."
"Good and interesting and fun storyline, would recommend to everyone."
"When I was 11 I was hooked on Buffy The Vampire Slayer, it was fun and smart and I found Sarah Michelle Gellar really sexy. At 17, I don't watch it as much, as I am so busy with schoolwork and music commitments, but on top of my film watching, one of my favourite hobbies, I like to watch Buffy. And I think it is great, true Season 1 starts off a little rocky, but it gets better and better, and by the time we get to Season 5 we have more intelligent dialogue, more gripping story lines and the acting is even better at this point. Out of the later episodes, one that surprised me hugely was ""Once More with Feeling"". I was sceptical initially at how it would work, but it did, no matter how laughable it seemed at the time. The music was great, and the singing was surprisingly tuneful. Back to talking about Buffy in general, the theme song is funky and totally kicks ass. Then there is the suitably Gothic photography and the above average special effects and make up. Also, Buffy benefits from really good story lines, good dialogue and characters that we like and love. Buffy is a great and resourceful heroine, and the sexy Sarah Michelle Gellar does a great job in the role. Nicolas Brendan is appealing also as Xander, I confess when I was younger I had a slight crush on him, David Boreanaz is a brooding Angel, Seth Green is a likable Oz and James Marsters is a great Spike. On tops, I really like Alyson Hannigan as Willow, it is a shame though that she hasn't done anything particularly good since, and Anthony Head is wonderful as the benevolent Giles. And also Michelle Trachtenberg judging by this, Ice Princess and Harriet the Spy has all the means of being a promising actress in the future. As characters, even the villains are interesting. Overall, I love Buffy The Vampire Slayer. 10/10 Bethany Cox"
"Buffy was a trailblazer. There isn't much to be said about this series that hasn't already been said.

It's a piece of history, though a little bit outdated now that TV budgets can accommodate better fight choreography, sets, cameras and CGI. Most of the performances are tonally perfect, outside of a few. Sarah Michelle Gellar absolutely carries the show on her shoulders and the show owes a lot of its success to her. There's some well crafted villains and some lame ones as well. But there are a plethora of interesting, genre breaking episodes that stand the test of time.

On it's whole, BTVS isn't a masterpiece like a lot of people claim it is and it doesn't withstand a more critical lens, but it does deserve its cult status because it truly is one of the most influential shows of its time."
"buffy the vampire slayer, great fun to watch if you've never seen it and you have an hour to spare, full of action and kick ass lines.

but all changes if you've been watching obsessively, the kick ass action and the cheesy lines give way to something far more important, the extreme symbolism, when i watch it im still shocked at how well joss has used the whole show to sum up the teenage girls struggle through life, all the characters merge together showing characteristics of a whole person, the demons show all bad people in life and how they concure them and the relationships show how hard it is at that age and how teenagers feel alone.

when watching even after the amount I've watched it through i still find new bits that amaze me, and so people who say buffy is a load of rubbish, obviously don't get its deeper side and just see a girl fighting off demons while tryng to date.

plus there's a musical episode :P what more could you want lol"
"During the early '90's, my favorite shows were Ren and Stimpy, Rocko's Modern Life, and the best of them all, Beavis and Butt-head. This show was like South Park, only it matched the culture of the early '90's. Beavis and Butt-head make me laugh so hard that I could have a heart attack. Everything from the way they laugh to the dirty comments that they make from one to another is part of what makes the show so funny.

The best moments of the show were the moments where they would be watching music videos on their television and making comments in the back ground.

There was a wide variety of unique characters in the show, such as their arrogant and overly strict gym teacher who wants to always get them in trouble, their hippie teacher who always tries to teach them about work, their elderly neighbor Tom Anderson who always has his vacations ruined by Beavis and Butt-head, their younger neighbor Stewart who always tries to hang out with them, and a student in their class named Darrea(huh huh, Diarrea). Darrea also had her own spin off show that was released during the year this show was canceled.

I always loved this show, but unfortunately, it started to go down hill when it had to be edited. After an incident where two trailer park kids were playing with matches and burned down their trailer, the show was blamed for causing this incident and had to be edited a lot. The episodes in the last season weren't as great either.

This is a great show, and it is way better than the cartoons that are released today(with the exception of South Park, I love that show). Fortunately, there are DVD's of Beavis and Butt-head from Time Life. If you ever get a chance to see this show, see it and find out what the hype was once all about."
"Beavis and Butt-Head is a brilliant TV show, especially for a TV show that is more often than not about ""toilet"" humor. That is usually not a good indication. Nowadays most movies and TV shows are about sexual promiscuity, perversity, drugs, etc. Beavis and Butt-Head is a show about two teenagers who are obsessed with sex, heavy metal music, etc. On top of that, the title characters are basically highly unintelligent. So how could Beavis and Butt-Head possibly be any good? Surprisingly, the TV show is not just awesome, it's - even more surprisingly - highly clever as well. It's important to give this show a chance before you can notice that it's much more than meets the eye.

The TV show accurately and cleverly portrays how the idiocy of the title characters does not fall short in this world. In the 1990s Beavis and Butt-Head in particular stood out in that regard. Ironically, in the 1990s a number of parents blamed Beavis and Butt-Head for the misbehavior of their children, totally failing to understand the point of the show, which is not for kids but shows what two kids do these days. It's like basing two teenage characters on two general modern teenagers and saying ""this is how your kids are"" to parents and a number of them respond by saying ""no that's who my kids are imitating"". The joke is on them but they are oblivious to it and that is the real power of Beavis and Butt-Head. You would almost want to be in their situation because of how the world has become. Being plain stupid is more than enough to ""outsmart"" people these days - as Beavis and Butt-Head accurately prove time after time. That makes it so easy to ""identify"" with Beavis and Butt-Head. Yet, at the same time, unlike movies and TV shows in general, Beavis and Butt-Head (the TV show) does not condone violence, drugs or anything like that. It's amazing how a ""potty"" humor show about two unintelligent teenagers is more intelligent and witty than most ""serious"" TV shows.

The first few seasons of Beavis and Butt-Head are horribly drawn and quite simplistic. You can skip the first two seasons. From there on the show gets better with every season. Almost the half of every episode consists of Beavis and Butt-Head watching and commenting on music videos.

On November 28, 1997, the last Beavis and Butt-Head episode of season 7 was aired. Beavis and Butt-Head was canceled. It was like MTV was canceled. By that time Beavis and Butt-Head was the only thing worthy to watch on MTV. Music videos in the 1990s began to be all about sex, pimping, drugs, prostitutes, gangsterism, etc. So at the time it was in my opinion a good idea of MTV to start focusing on non-musical content and that's where Beavis and Butt-Head perfectly fit in. It was almost like MTV was making fun of the people who liked the music videos of those days. Absolutely brilliant. When Beavis and Butt-Head was canceled, MTV began to die out. In the next decade MTV (""Music Television"") became no longer ""MTV"" because it was no longer about music. Instead, reality shows like 16 and Pregnant (2009) began to dominate MTV. MTV as it once was was simply gone.

It would take almost 14 years before Beavis and Butt-Head returned in 2011. The 2000s had passed without Beavis and Butt-Head. Music videos still exist but not as they once were. TV in general is as good as dead. Computers and the internet have largely replaced the ""need"" for TV. Sex, drugs, nudity, etc are now no longer rare on TV. So does Beavis and Butt-Head have a place on TV anymore? Well, not so much when it comes to music videos or sexual content in them. That's for sure. Season 8 nevertheless feels like Beavis and Butt-Head has never been away, even though the music videos have been replaced by the reality shows that are currently being aired on MTV. The title characters have become wittier and the quality of the show appears (so far) to be the same. The world has changed since Beavis and Butt-Head was canceled in the late 1990s. In today's world - with today's MTV, dying TV, internet, etc - Beavis and Butt-Head will most likely never become as popular as they once were. That is not say that Beavis and Butt-Head is or will not be just as good. No other adult-comedic cartoon show has come along in the 14 years of Beavis and Butt-Head's absence that has matched the quality and excellence of Beavis and Butt-Head. Not even South Park (1997).

I would most definitely recommend Beavis and Butt-Head to anyone (who is an adult)! It may not be for everyone (due to the type of comedy of the show) but for everybody else it is a must-see TV show!"
"BABH was a dumb show that worked very well.

it's about 2 friends being dimwitted in their small town either by accident or on purpose.

During the 90s BABH was a legend. It redefined adult cartoon sitcoms. Simpsons sure but BABH were on another level. It was just 2 bone head guys without a wife and kids.

Overall a great show.

What can be learned? Dimwitted can be cool if done right...

Verdict: Beavis and Butt Head gave birth to the King of the Hill"
"Okay, I admit it. I am a closet Beavis & Butthead fan. Well, actually, not all that closeted, but when I tell people I enjoy the show, sometimes they just don't get it. Some of them say, ""But it's just stupid! It's just two morons laughing and being crude all the time!""

Well, I thought so too, before I ever watched the show. I had heard of them; I would occasionally see B & B pop up on an MTV awards show and receive lots of laughter and applause - the laughter and applause of recognition. I knew they were popular but I didn't ""get it."" Then, part of the way through the first episode I watched, I ""got it."" The reason Beavis & Butthead is so funny is that it does an extremely dead-on accurate job of portraying a very real aspect of teenage males that had been completely overlooked in a lot of previous television.

I can even remember the exact moment I ""got it"": Beavis and Butthead were watching a video by the Red Hot Chili Peppers and adding their usual commentary, and when the video ended and the name of the band appeared on the screen, Butthead read their name out loud. And when I heard the tone of voice he used, it hit me. It's that sarcastic, detached, ""I'm so cool"" kind of voice that teenage boys use constantly - even for such a banality as a simple declarative statement about a band's name.

And of course, what makes B & B's sarcastic detached cockiness all the more ironic is that they have extremely passive and uneventful lives: they spend all their time ""hanging out"" and doing the same stupid stuff, yet they somehow (well, Butthead especially) consider themselves qualified to put on this jaded cynical act. Everything they do is as observers. They see sex and rock music on TV, they think and talk about sex and rock music all the time, and they've never had sex or played rock music. And the irony never hits them. They're somehow this weird combination of innocence and jadedness at the same time, and this, combined with their passive observer nature, makes Beavis and Butthead an extremely dead-on accurate portrayal of adolescent males.

Of course Beavis and Butthead are exaggerations of teenage males, but nevertheless I find them a rather refreshing change from the portrayals of teenagers in shows such as Beverly Hills 90210 and Dawson's Creek, who seem as articulate, poised, and self-confident as a bunch of sophisticated 28-year-olds, and who do not ring true to me at all."
"Beavis and Butt-Head will be remembered for a long time. The gross, sick, and always hilarious show was the best show ever on MTV and probably nothing like it will ever come close. Poeple will always remember it's sick skits (B&B trying to grow beards, B&B playing frog baseball, B&B trying to score) it's dialouge at the couch during music videos, and many other things. This show led other shows like South Park into the promised land (ironically, South Park came out at around the same time when B&B were cancelled). This show will always remain as one of the defining shows of the generation X. So, uhuhuhu-hehehe. A++"
"""BEAVIS AND BUTT-HEAD,"" in my opinion, is an absolutely freaking hilarious MTV classic! I haven't seen every episode, but I still enjoyed it. It's hard to say which episode was my favorite. It would have to be either the one where Beavis (voice of Mike Judge) knocks the outhouse over while he and Butt-Head (voice of Mike Judge) are waiting to use the bathroom while at a concert or the one where he and Butt-Head think they're psychics. However, I think it was always funny when a mishap occurred. I always laughed at that. It was all the main characters stayed with the show throughout its entire run. Everyone always gave a good performance, the episodes were funny, and the writing was always very strong. In conclusion, I hope it stays on MTV-2 for fans of the show to see for a long time."
"Pure classic among my top favorite shows ever! The humor isn't for everyone and best not to take seriously. It's beyond funny in my opinion, MTV's best; even though it mostly has trash on it. I almost never get tired of watching most of the episodes, I love quoting some of the silly lines too. Mike Judge has really done some excellent work, despite the crude humor. Also love the music always have."
"Beavis and Butthead is and will always be the epitome of amazing TV. It's just as funny now as it was before. It's not funnier, it's not less funny, it's just Beavis and Butthead. Beavis and Butthead is the perfect show to watch if you're a stoner, just bored, or want a good laugh in general.

From using frogs as baseballs to trying to score during the apocalypse, Beavis and Butthead never fail to find themselves doing the dumb senseless acts that we all love to see. Will they ever score? We'll just have to continue to watch and see. Hopefully not anytime soon, I would love to see many more years of Beavis and Butthead.

If you're expecting a comedy to be taken seriously and have a major plot line, well you've came to the wrong show, clearly. You should know that just by reading the title. Just sit down, crack open a beer, and enjoy the show."
This was one of the funniest cartoons ever. As stupid as it may seem it's actually genius. The more cerebral you consider yourself the funnier this cartoon is.
Need I say more? Two lovable stoners getting through life from the couch. A great and easy to digest concept. They need to bring this back. It would get me into the theaters but also would eventually just watch from home ha.
"I don't know about the constant revivals and the meta 'we know we're dumb' crap.

The show was brilliant for it's time, prophetic yet introspective about the pop (and mental) climate.

To me, it died with the (televised) music video."
"Seriously... I'm amazed at all the good feedback this show has here. All we have in this show is two stupid kids who keep doing an annoying laugh and they do OCCASIONAL funny things only in like... 2 of the shows, while most of the others sucked... as then they comment on music videos which I cannot stand personally while they either love or like.

In most episodes, the only things you will hear are the repitive ""let's go score with some chicks"", or ""I'll kick your ass beavis"", or the better yet and usually used quote ""that was cool"", and above all, their annoying laugh.

If you want a good animated show, try The Simpsons, Ren and Stimpy, South Park, this show is just not worth the time or energy it takes to watch this awful MTV series truthfully."
"The end of Beavis and Butthead was like the end of a cultural era. Grunge and those early 90 fads were dying out, to make way for the crass commercialism and ultra materialism of the youth generations that would follow, essentially helping to wipe out not only what made music culture great, but also what made MTV great. Beavis and Butthead was part of that cool past of part of a totally idiotic, carefree culture.

Beavis and Butthead, for those who too young to know about it, was an animated series created by Mike Judge, of the now popular FOX television series, King of the Hill, which is actually based on one of the characters from Beavis & Butthead (the neighbor Anderson, who was the primitive form of Hank Hill). The brief episodes, usually two packed in a half-hour, followed the mishaps of two ugly braindead teenagers. Their primary pasttimes were raising hell, making dirty jokes, and just laughing. The main characters usually included Buzz Cut, the anal muscular gym teacher; Van Dreesen, the pansy hippy teacher who's plans to get Beavis & Butthead to do something good usually backfired; their ultra-sheltered neighbor, Stuart; and the depressed, Daria (aka ""Diarreha"") who later developed into a spin-off series called ""Daria"".

Beavis & Butthead were so stupid and so clueless as to the disasters that usually went on around them, which is why the situations were so funny. You can't really expect to take a show like this seriously. It was just the stupid antics that made it great. Plus, because it was on MTV, it was a vehicle for music videos which were particularly key because they were often rare videos. And Beavis & Butthead did their MST3K-type of commentary as you watched sometimes full videos that acted as an intermission to their short episodes. All around, despite poor drawings, this show is still a classic and even created it's own subculture of marveled stupidity. But, I still enjoyed it.

And in retrospect, it's probably a lot better, considering a lot of the crap that is on television now to entertain teens--especially MTV. Even if you do get to see the reruns, they usually cut out the videos now to make way for extra commercial time (MTV sucks!). But, they did release episodes on tape. I don't know if they've made it to DVD."
This SHOW is one OF the greatest shows THAT i EVER SEENED AND best OF mtv!
Simultaneously idiotic and idiotically hilarious. Watch them all.
"Great moronic dark and casual humor from the ages of the real Mtv by Mike Judge. Two idiot teenagers on their couch in front of a tv. Huhuh yeah. This sucks.

I dont think these series need any description at all."
"In the 90's MTV had an identity little cable networks can match. They appealed to the youth with its terrific shows like ""TRL: Total Request Live"" and ""Yo! MTV Raps."" Even when it first introduced the reality television phenomenon it's mostly known for now, it held its creative and enlightening manner with the beginning seasons of ""The Real World,"" ""Making the Video,"" and even ""The Grind"" had mass appeal. All these shows centered on the theme which the network has lost focus of in the last ten years or so, MUSIC. Go figure. It's Music Television and they hardly show it any longer. One of the best things on MTV in the 1990's was Mike Judge's very controversial yet hilariously funny ""Beavis and Butt-head."" These two whimsical, giggling teenagers got themselves in many situations with the goal of ""scoring"" in my mind. When not trying to pick up the ladies, they sat around their house watching music videos and offering up hysterical commentary. The decision to reignite the series after its end in 1997 was probably one of the best decisions MTV has had for itself in years. A breath of fresh air has been brought back to the network encompassing the same great humor it had before but holding nothing back. The first four episodes have poked fun of teen series sensation Twilight with Beavis and Butt-head trying to become members of an undead cult in order to get girls, ""Teen Mom,"" Katy Perry, and the Jersey Shore crew. Its MTV's answer to great adult animated cartoons like South Park and Family Guy but will not crash and burn like Ren & Stimpy did during their ""call backs."" I expect great things from this and for it to succeed. Catch the hilarious duo on Thursday nights at 10:00pm on MTV!"
"Words can't describe how much I enjoy ""Beavis and Butthead"". I started watching the show when I was a kid but my parents didn't think the series was appropriate for me but I still ended up sneak watching and flipping the tv to Nick at Nite if a parent came into the room. :D

Beavis and Butthead are both stupid but the writing for the series is intelligent enough that you don't get the feeling of being annoyed by watching them. At least I don't feel that way. I think of a series like ""Boy Meets World"" where they turn Eric into an idiot and it came off as being obnoxious more than anything. Beavis and Butthead aren't in that category. I think it just boils down to better writing for this series. These two get into so much stuff and it's hilarious. I think the episode I have the fondest memories of is ""No Laughing"". If you've watched even 10 minutes of Beavis and Butthead, you KNOW how much these two laugh. Doesn't matter if something inappropriate is being said or not, these two are all the time laughing. So just picture this episode where there's consequences on the line if they laugh while in school and of course Coach Buzzcut has decided the lesson plan for that week will be subjects (sex ed) that will have Beavis and Butthead laughing harder than ever. But they do manage to hold back the laughter til school ends and then they can let it out. The episode is much better than my description tbh.

I use a streaming service and have decided to watch the Beavis and Butthead episodes on there. I've long given up the hope of any channel picking the entire series up and playing them. I guess it's streaming, dvds or noting at all. Anyway, I'll be the first to admit that a lot of the stuff I liked as a kid hasn't aged well for me and I don't like it as much as an adult as I did when I was a child. Beavis and Butthead are thankfully an exception to that. I've gotten a kick out of watching these episodes and laughing as much as Beavis and Butthead do.

There's one thing I also want to point out. I don't think I liked the music video commentaries when I was a kid because it broke up the flow of the actual episode. I got older and the commentary is now something I enjoy."
"I loved this show. It came out when I was 11. It was so funny and my mom wanted to kill me for watching. With that in mind, I'll never forget how many times my brother and I snook and watched it in our basement. Even now the show is still funny. Now I'm fortunate to watch it, without the remote constantly in hand. The movie was awesome too, though toned down a lot. It's quite obvious this allowed for South Park, which explains why South Park was far less ridiculed. And South Park the movie was not toned down at all. Beavis and Butthead is definitely MTV's crowning achievement. Before they ruined their programming with 24 hours of Real World/Road Rules and TRL."
"A classic show with some ""edgy"" humor about Teo boys just being rude. Where you can meet some of the most interesting characters around. No matter what episode you start on you will find some humor in it. Some might be dated but most of it is great."
"Strangely funny at times, but pretty annoying at others, ""Beavis and Butthead"" has become an American icon and as recognizable as King Kong or Darth Vader. Their constant, and I mean literally constant, teenage laughs, their lowbrow humour, and odd personality traits make them endearing characters. Beavis is, by far, my favourite. His laugh isn't nearly as annoying as Butthead's. He also suffers from multiple personalities. Sometimes he'll put his shirt over his head, walk around with his arms lift and repeatedly state that he's the great Cornholio. Cornholio always needs TP for his bunghole. Strangely enough he also claims that in his country they don't have any bungholes.

Anyway, what can be said? The jokes are sometimes hysterical and it is somewhat of a celebration of stupidity. If you're into Dumb and Dumber-style humour then this is for you."
"I still remember when Frog Baseball first aired on MTV. In some sort of odd, surreal manner, the cartoon captured the stupid actions that I think every boy growing up in America engages in. I cringe now thinking about how I burned a crippled grasshopper using a magnifying glass, but it was interesting at the time for some reason. Growing up in the 1980s we all knew ""stoners."" These were the kids who wore Iron Maiden t-shirts to school, grew their hair long, had immature moustaches and were at least two inches taller than everyone else because they had flunked a grade or two. We laughed at them because they were so stupid even when not stoned. So it was easy to understand Beavis & Co because we already knew them, some of us were even them. To the extent that GenXers like myself would spurn the excess of the 1980s and embrace the grunge movement of the 1990s, Beavis & Co were sort of a strange post-modern anthem for us. Strange because like Beavis & Co we didn't care if we had an anthem. It was just an inside joke that we all immediately got even if it was awful."
Oz is one of the best and most underrated shows of all-time!. It's one of the rare shows where just about every episode is great! HBO is known for having all these great shows over the years and Oz is right at the top of those great shows. It's about the inmates and guards at certain wing in a prison. It's easily the best pest prison series of all-time. You really get attached to the character and care what happens next. That's because the writing and acting is so great. I've watched it all the way through a few times now and probably will again in the best future. I wish they would try to bring this series and back or reboot it but with the same creator and writers.
"This is such a powerful show, superbly acted, that frankly I feel it's the best TV drama ever made. I know plenty of Hill Street Blues/NYPD Blue/Prime Suspect (etc) fans would enthusiastically argue this point, but I feel Oz is so well acted, so well realised and so darn entertaining that it's no contest. The characters are very watchable, the stories are gripping, and so much happens in each episode that the viewer has a lot of food for thought once the show is over. I'm currently at the 4th season being in UK, so I don't know the latest developments, but I got a lot of story to look forward to...

The fact it's also very satirical, particularly from Augustus Hill's commentary adds beautifully to the mix.

Nothing short of outstanding."
This is one of HBO's first big hits and is still one of not only HBO's best but one of the best in general! Oz will hook you from the very first episode through the finale and every episode is great!
"Oz is one of HBO's best ever series. It is gritty and violent, yet ceaselessly compelling and riveting.

The production values are consistently of very high quality, with skillful photography and an authentic setting. The writing is superb, in fact Oz is one of my favourite ever shows when it comes to written quality and the story lines are outstanding.

Oz benefits further from efficient direction, strongly drawn characters and the acting particularly Ernie Hudson and Harold Perrineau I don't know where to begin praising.

All in all, a brilliant series. 10/10 Bethany Cox"
"It's strange how Oz somewhat got overlooked by shows like The Wire, Deadwood and Sopranos. I guess it comes to the very dark, adult material. Cause this takes no prisoners (no pun intended) describing what goes on in the experimental prison of Oz. The start of it relates around Tobias Beacher (Lee Tergesen) a white collar ending up in max after a fatal DUI. Naive as he is, he becomes the victim of ubernazi Schillinger (JK Simmons in his breaktrough role). The rest of it is a really well made prison drama. Even Netflix own Orange is The New Black have several times mentioned Oz between inmates. It's NOT for everyone. It's extremely graphic in parts, some terrible rape scenes and the ""usual"" sex scenes (seeing it again, it seems HBO has censored scenes). But beneath it all, there's an excellent written show, with really good actors. My only big complaint is season 4, which is twice as long as the rest, at 16 episodes. You feel the season drags out with fluffy sidestories. Overall, one of HBOs best, and the start of the great JK Simmons."
"Oz is set in Oswald State Correctional Facility. It tells the story of confrontation, cruelty, violence, hate and survival at any cost. in a place like Oz, you have to have eyes in the back of your head.

This completely original, intelligent and compelling drama tells of how warped life becomes as soon as you step through the gates of Emerald City.

What is supposed to be a state of art correctional facility is in fact far from being such. The show brings to light some of the many flaws in the prison system, the underestimating of the humanity that cold hard killers are capable of still retaining, and the one true fact: The prisoners are the one's who control the prison.

This magnificent and somewhat surreal show teaches about the importance of every life and helps give an understanding to the reasons that most of the prisoners are there. This show may seem shocking at first but to truly tell it like it is, such a thing is necessary.

Oz is a great depiction of hell on earth and how such a place teaches you some of the most important lessons you will ever learn."
"Oz, no Dorothy you're not in Kansas anymore. Oz is the television show that pushed the limits in what you can get away with on television. Oz is real and violent, and it also makes for the single best series on TV, ever. With performance that grab attention, and some of the best direction ever on TV, Oz should be watched by ritual."
"Ive Watched it 3 times and enjoyed every time.

Every thing in this show has done well.

The storyline, the directing, the acting.

This is legenadry series."
"First off, this show is amazing. The drama, suspense, action - it's addictive. The character development and arcs are intense, emotional, well constructed. A definite recommend.

That being said, you have to suspend disbelief. All the reviews saying how this is an accurate portrayal of prison life - it is surely not. The constant hits and stabbings, the corrupt guards. It's not real. Do these things happen? Yes. But they're a rarity, not the norm. Also, prisoners don't have access to weapons like this - no straight razors in the Barbershop, the knives in the kitchen are tethered down. And all the unseen murders? No. Just no. There are cameras nearly everywhere in prison. They would all get caught.

Despite the exaggeration of prison life, it is an intensely addictive show. Oz > Sopranos."
This should be a award winning series for story line and the outstanding portrayal of the actors. I was stunned by the quality of the actors due to never my never hearing of this series. It's time to bring this series back to life. I believe it ended after 6 seasons in 2003. Please bring Oz back to life.
"This is my first review for IMDb, I usually use this site just to see what new movies and shows are coming out. But after seeing all of HBO's later shows leap frog it's first masterpiece I had to say something. Yes this is HBO's FIRST hour long drama, and if it wasn't for this show, many if not all it's later shows would not have existed.The best part of the show is the writing. Each episode starts with inmate Augustus Hill, (Harold Parrineau or ""Micheal"" from Lost). And focuses on different topics, such as race, law, society, love, etc. He does an amazing job of getting you to think about the lesson being taught. OZ takes place mainly in an experimental unit within the state prison called ""Emerald City"", managed by Tim Mcmanus. There is no one main story in OZ, (HBO never does that with any of their shows, ain't nobody got time fo dat). Each inmate has their own crimes that they committed, which is described by Hill in satirical form. Murder, torture, dealing t*ts (drugs in prison talk), rape all happen in this show so it's not for anyone with weak stomachs. All of their stories are separate but blend together beautifully. I was addicted after the first episode so check it out. Everyone's got time for game of thrones, make time for the show that MADE IT POSSIBLE!"
"No...I don't mean bunk-beds. I mean bunk.

I watched every season of Oz from start to finish and I have to say, it never wasn't entertaining. Anyone who thinks this show could be viewed by just anyone better think again. Here is just a taste of what you're in for if you decide to embark on the same journey that I just did: defecation, anal rape, (on camera...) suicide, gouging of eyes, shanking, urine being consumed, feces being played with, torture, more anal rape, (this time with a spoon...)and plenty of good old fashioned bloody violence. Needless to say, it's a graphic show, but unfortunately for Tom Fontana, (writer of most episodes in the series) it fails to remain plausible.

What starts out in season one as a well-acted, superbly-filmed prison drama degenerates into a wishy-washy, ridiculous, unsatisfying shock-fest that makes you scratch your head and say, 'how the hell could that happen?'

Examples of ridiculous plot lines:

1. Cyril O'Reilly, a mentally handicapped man is thrown into a maximum security prison, then sentenced to death for defending his brother and taking another man's life. Our right wing (of course!) Governor is cold-hearted and cruel and cares not for any prisoner, much less a retarded one...The political statements in this show are blatant and, as per usual with left wing TV, ludicrous.

2. Chinese refugees are thrown in maximum security prison. Please! Like this would EVER happen. Political refugees would be placed into a middle school before being thrown in with a bunch of murderers and rapists. Of course, one of these refugees who we grow to love is brutally slain in graphic detail for us to enjoy. Barf. Pure shock value.

3. Prisoners on work detail roam the halls, kitchen, and gym unsupervised. A prisoners' father and brother are even shanked, separately while they are visiting! In one scene, a Moslem gets sliced open with a box cutter by two Aryan thugs in a storage room. No one hears his screams. In another scene, a man gets his arms and legs broken on a wrestling mat while a guard watches and laughs. No one is held accountable.

4. In ""Oz,"" every correctional officer is not only corrupt, but they are even gang members, murderers and sadists. If I had to bet, real correctional officers are deeply offended by this show. The CO's in ""Oz"" set up murders, are bought by prisoners for a pittance, and show no mercy. A female CO even 'rapes' several male prisoners! And of course, no one sees any of this or investigates the crimes. It's portrayed as 'just part of prison life!' Give me a large break.

5. In ""Oz,"" murders take place on a daily basis. ""Oz"" has more murders in a given year than the entire city of Detroit. No one thinks to put in camera surveillance? The murders are brushed off unless they are committed by one of our main stars who we like. Then they are sent to death row.

6. Our main character, Tobias Beecher, slices and dices a guard (with fingernail clippers, no less...) and nothing ever comes of it. The guard is simply gone. It's never mentioned again in that episode, or later episodes.

7. Prisoners are purposely left alone with those who they seek to kill. In one scene, a vicious Aryan psycho is left alone with a dentist in a small office. The guard simply shuts the door. I guess the Aryan paid him $20... In another scene, as I mentioned above, a visiting lawyer, who happens to be a prisoner's father, is shut into a hallway so a pragg can shank him and gut him like a fish. When the visitor calls for the guard, the guard slams the door in his face. Guess he got paid off, too.

They tried to intertwine too many stories and introduce too many characters in ""Oz,"" most of whom were uninteresting and did nothing for the main story lines. It probably could have been done in half as many seasons. The audience has to be 'reminded' of plot lines from prior episodes by these little black and white flashbacks. It gets very tiring trying to keep up with it all.

I could probably go on and on but it's not worth it. I did watch every single episode of this show and I did enjoy a lot of it. What I did like tallies up to be more than what I didn't, so for that, I'll say thanks to Tom Fontana, Levinson and crew. Lots of good acting and great lines. Lots of memorable scenes and I especially enjoyed the character Kareem Said who was, by far, the coolest man in the show.

If you can stomach wretched, shocking scenes, a lot of racial slurs along with derogatory terms and plenty of implausibility, I'd recommend buying this series. Buy every season because it is highly addictive. But get it used if you can. And get ready to pass it on because it's not the kind of show that many people will enjoy watching repeatedly.

6 out of 10, kids."
"Oz starts off extremely well in the first season. I was almost to the point of convincing my wife to rewatch it with me since I knew I had a few more seasons to go, but I started the second season and was extremely dismayed.

If you're a fan of The Wire, you'll love seeing so many of the actors from that cast on Oz, but you'll miss the intricate plots. After season one, where characters' values actually mean something to them, it seems that the writers got as uncreative as Grey's Anatomy by just having each character question the values that defined his or her character.

There's way too much expositional dialog. So much of the show is recapped through inmates retelling what just happened in unnatural ways. If the plot needs to progress, they don't even bother waiting within a few tin minute blocks. Prisoner A needs to be killed? Prisoner B has a knife under his bed. Prisoner C steals knife; Prisoner A gets killed. That's about as complicated as the plot ever gets after the first season, and they don't at least give the audience the benefit of anticipating the action by letting the plot encompass a few episodes.

Throughout much of the show, I continually ask myself, ""So what? What's the significance?"" It becomes plot by the numbers with no metaphor.

I watched through half of the third season and just couldn't take it anymore. There are a few actors that still do a good job with the bad writing they are given, but it's not enough to continue."
"OK, it's violent and bloody and vicious and cruel. It's also wildly creative, beautifully filmed, brilliantly acted (with very few exceptions) and has a great framing device. The stories are both filled with detail and minutiae, and also have overarching moral tales and ""big picture"" flow. At the end of almost every episode you'll probably find yourself muttering ""This is SUCH a good show!""

Although it is ostensibly the story of a prison and its many prisoners, 'Oz' can be viewed as primarily the story of one man, Tobias Beecher. Beecher has committed vehicular manslaughter while driving drunk. Because Beecher is a lawyer, the court decides to make an example of him and sends him to maximum security at Oswald Penitentiary. His journey through Oz is basically the rest of the series, and it's certainly no yellow brick road he follows. Everything that you could imagine happening in a prison setting happens, and probably a lot you wouldn't imagine.

He gets assigned to ""Em"" City (Emerald City), an experimental unit in Oz; the goal of Em City is to try a different living environment, one that might give the prisoners a chance at changing their lives and possibly rehabilitate them. Managed by a true prison reform zealot, Tim McManus, Em City is for many prisoners the only hope in their lives. The inmates of Em City are some of the most brutal offenders in the entire penitentiary - McManus insists that these are the prisoners to try to reach. McManus also picks newer prisoners, ones that don't have life sentences, to add to the mix and to give them a shot at rehabilitation.

Every episode has a storyteller - most of the time the storyteller is Augustus Hill, shot while killing a cop and now confined to a wheelchair. Because he is unable to be physically brutal anymore, because he is more imprisoned than even his fellow prisoners, Augustus is very insightful and is used to heighten and clarify themes for the audience.

The other inmates in Em City all have their own character development and story arcs - some are impressively vibrant but brief, others last for the whole series - but ultimately the writers always return to Beecher and his story. His friends (few), his enemies (many), his family, and his relationships with the prison staff.

Amid the worst that prison can dish out, the inmates struggle with the meaning of religion, with definitions of family, with the corruption of politics, with friendship, betrayal, and ultimately, survival. There are moments of sheer wanton destruction, unspeakable violence, shocking cruelty, and pure evil. It's prison! There is nothing glorified here; inmates do drugs to escape the horror of their realities, gangs murder each other over trivialities, inmates and guards commit rape just because they can. But how they manage to survive - and IF they manage to survive - keeps you watching.

Some key performances: The always perfect J.K. Simmons as Schillinger, the leader of the Aryans; Chris Meloni as Chris Keller (quite a different part than his character on L&O: SVU!); Lee Tergesen as Beecher; Eamonn Walker as Said, the leader of the Muslims; Dean and Scott Winters (real-life brothers) as Ryan and Cyril O'Reilly; and Kirk Acevedo as Miguel Alvarez, a member of the Latinos. But honestly, the whole cast is excellent. Even most of the ""guest starring"" roles - new inmates who practically have an expiration date stamped on them - are good, and at least are pretty interesting.

It's coming out on DVD in dribs and drabs - rent it, borrow it, steal it, whatever. But watch it!"
"I just recently picked up this show, because I was bored with all the shows that get canceled after just one season. I wanted something that I could dig into for a longer time. I knew the show existed for quite some time and I always felt intrigued to watch it, but I just never got around to it.

This show was just one big surprise. The acting is superb, the character development is just insanely great. The dialogue is thrilling, the humor is very subtle and the violence is very realistic. From the first episode I was completely hooked, and it only got better and better from the start.

This show represents everything I miss in current TV-shows; psychologically challenging, sometimes so realistic that it becomes uneasy to watch. As if it was happening right in front of your eyes in real life.

One of the best shows I've ever seen. For me, this goes right next to The Wire and the Sopranos."
"That's right. This show is so fantastic there are no words which make it justice!

Right from the very first episode, there is a LOT going on, and many reasons why the next episode is worth watching. Conflicts are introduced which are built upon in the next episode, and new conflicts then arise in THAT episode. Sometimes as a result of the PREVIOUS conflicts. That's how complex this show is, the heat is in the air the whole time.

The writing is AMAZING. You never can be certain of what will happen next and the dialogue ranges from witty or darkly hilarious to intense or very heartbreaking. A lot of episodes among all the violence and scumbags contain interesting messages about life. Every episode has a theme; it could be revenge, sex, love, drugs... These are presented with the narration by this show's moral centerpiece Augustus Hill. And still, he's not perfect himself. All of the characters have their own flaws which this series present excellently.

The characters are MANY, but somehow this show manages to make almost every one of them fascinating in some way. Even those who appear in only one single episode can make you attached to the screen and anticipated over what will happen with him next (it's USUALLY a him, it's a prison full of males after all). Just when you think you know how someone is like, that character can go through things which radically alter their behavior. Even the most innocent of people can suddenly flip. Among my favorites are Tobias Beecher (the closest thing to a main character), Vern Schillinger, Tim McManus, Kareem Said, Father Ray Mukada, Simon Adebisi, Omar White... There are just too damn many, man! There are all sorts of people to get invested by, and the writers respect character development to such a point that you rarely feel like someone is one-dimensional.

Taboo subjects are touched upon, such as racism, homophobia, rape, drug abuse among other things. You will find at least 10 people here who either holds these opinions or has done any of the latter stuff. Despite what is said to be a maximum security level, Oz is a rat maze! You have to look around the corner, be suspicious about everyone. Somebody could act like your best friend just to later brutally execute you. Sure it occasionally gets unrealistic and even a bit convoluted (Aging pills? An unconscious body which disappears without explanation?) but it's easy to overlook since there's always something to keep my eyes on. It never gets so distracting that I become angry and turn it off. Oh no, boy. My eyes are glued to the screen even more than Charlie Sheen is addicted to sex.

Everything is mesmerizing. Hell, it even has one of the best theme songs of all time! The cinematography as well, it's shockingly impressive! I especially have to praise Alex Zakrzewski, who is the most frequent director of photography. Give the man an award already!

To say this show is a must-see would be an understatement. If you've never seen Oz, you haven't completed your life. Breathtaking television."
"This show has no big award. How can people let this happen? This show is one of the best thing on TV by miles. The stories by Augustus Hill,presenting a new prisoner, not knowing who's gonna die next...every thing is great.

I really wasn't sure if i'm gonna like a show with bunch of drug addicted black guy, disturbingly bad Natzi men. There's not one good character. Everyone is doing some bad things. It makes you one of those prisoner but you wouldn't wanna be there because that place is like hell.

As a whole, Oz is a gripping series. It's cannot to be missed. You can start anytime. 9.7/10 Best Seasons: Compelete Series (6 Seasons)"
"One of the greatest TV shows of all time. It is a show I come back to atleast once every 2 years to watch again. From the acting, to the camera work, to the characters, to the writing, for me its a top 10 tv show of all time. I am not joking, OZ has given me the same level of enjoyment as Twin Peaks, The Wire, Breaking Bad, Endeavour and Carnivale.

Go buy all the seasons and watch them, you will end up being hooked!

ONE OF THE BEST SHOWS OF ALL TIME!"
Best prison series of all time by far. You will feel your heart sink as characters are tormented and killed. It paints a grim and dystopian portrait of prison life that is highly addictive to watch
"I recently rewatched Oz and forgot how fantastic and powerful of a show this was. Every aspect and story line is raw, honest and sometimes brutal, which is what makes this show amazing. I have not seen anything like it since, and sincerely wish there were additional seasons. This show could have gone on a lot longer, and definitely deserved to. Great work all around!"
"Gripping, unflinching, no holds barred look at life on the inside. It's not for the faint of heart. Brilliant and intriguing characters. Unfortunately it ended way too soon.

Would love them to revive Oz."
"I would be a little subjective because this is my favourite ""type"" of a tv show, but OZ is much more than just another prison drama, it carries a certain message, with all of its characters (to the smallest part) full of uniquenes and individuality, and that message is that no matter what religion, skin color, sexual orientation, or sins makes a man what he is, value of his life is not something to be lightly taken away. The most important thing in human society is equality, no matter on what level or on what grounds. And people do change... I highly recommend this series, because it is one of those rare ones that will force you to question your believes, no matter who you are and what you believe. Thumbs up!!!"
"When this show debuted, my friends and I would make sure our schedule was clear to catch each new episode live. I have heard it accurately described as a male soap opera. Every week, something crazy happened. Network television wasn't playing anything like this. The character development available in a mutiple-season series was impossible to achieve in a two- or three-hour film.

This show constantly made me wonder how I'd fare in a maximum-security prison. It convinced me to prioritize a spot in my budget for Home Box Office (HBO). With one of the Ghostbusters at the helm, a plethora of cameo appearances by hip-hop stars and professional athletes, and an unforgettable theme song, the first hour-long drama that HBO ever produced also put Harold Perrineau, Simmons, Dean Winters, Eamonn Walker, and BD Wong, among others, on the world map.

Over time, especially in comparison to HBO's later projects, some of the scenes seem a bit hokey. Also, shotgunning episodes can be a little depressing, given the subject matter. Still, this series is a pop-culture requirement.

"The best thing of this show is there are no background audiences laughing at even poor jokes. There are many sitcoms who use these tricks to add laughter and it is sometimes little bit irritating. The show depends on great dialogues, one liners and Steve Carell.

To name a few, I liked S4E8 and Threat Level Midnight episodes a lot!!

Michael Scott's character carries the show on its shoulders. After Steve Carell's departure, I find it difficult to binge watch all the episodes. That's my opinion!! Some people liked the show after Steve but few episodes were becoming excruciatingly long and boring. But still there were some gags and laughs.

Must watch!! Everyone for sure will like it. My personal favourites are one liners and how Michael jokes around with every character like Oscar, Daryll, Stanley etc."
"The Office is absolutely, without a doubt, one of the greatest tv shows ever created and easily one of the best comedies I've seen in my lifetime! It's at the top of just about every ""best sitcom ever"" list for a reason...because it's incredible! Just about every episode is hilarious, which is nearly impossible for any tv show but The Office comes pretty darn close. All you have to do is read through some of these reviews to see how loved this show really is. I'll always miss it but at least we'll always have the reruns to watch!"
"I'm from Scotland and loved the British ""Office"". But I adore the American version! Steve Carell leads a great cast and I'm not surprised it has lasted so long. I'm working my way through Series 3 and have series 4 and 5 to look forward to. It's amazing how much the writers can get into 20 minutes. I like it when there is a double episode. I too am so glad there is no laughter track (which has stopped me watching quite a few comedy shows). I have noticed in this third series that the camera can be very annoying when it whizzes from character to character - far too quickly. Completely unnecessary. Steve's ""Michael"" conveys so much about the character - he's full of himself but so vulnerable and anxious for friends. Rainn Wilson's ""Dwight"" is just brilliant. And I love the company name - ""Dunder Mifflin""!"
"This show has changed my life. The way I see things, the way I live. This show was then for me when I needed it the most. One of the best cinematic/artistic creation by men. This show teaches you love, compassion, finding beauty in simple things in life. Story of a small paper supply company in a small town, yet took the world by storm."
"Honestly, I thought show as 'boring' even before I watched a single episode. Seriously, what interesting could happen in an office environment? I remember first scene I saw from this show. It was from an internet wallpaper with Michael Scott with a white board behind him saying ""You miss 100% of the shots you don't take"".

Then after years from that, I somehow started watching ""The Office"", I don't really remember why I did that. What I love most about this show is it's raw nature. The camera is kind of shaky yet still brings the best scenes...something that I had never seen before in a TV sitcom. It may seem less professional but adds real life, personal touch with the TV show and the characters in them.

Obviously, Michael Scott is one of my favourite character. Jim, Andy, Dwight, Pam, Erin, Kevin, Oscar, Angela, Creed and even the camera crew include in my favourite list.

What I learned from this show is that it's okay to be weird and different ,that you won't be welcomed as you wanted it to be ( remembering Michael Scott attempts ), that you can't wait and expect things to happen for you, that it's okay to be hated and feel hate to others....it's all dependent on time. People change, feelings change, situations change. All you got to do is be yourself and be true to your heart and everything will fall into it's place.

I love every minute I spent on this show <3"
"I do not have a single negative thing to say about The Office. It is by far my favorite show. I eagerly await a new episode every week.

All the unique characters have depth and are well developed.

As to all the people who don't like it because its based on the U.K. version, get over it. It has been taken to a completely different level. The characters in a spin off are not supposed to stay the exact same, otherwise a spin off would be pointless.

The characters are constantly evolving, and they are never constantly the protagonist or antagonist, so they are all at some point endearing. The characters are wonderfully bizarre yet real.

If you don't find this show funny, then you need to get a funny bone. Writers, keep em coming."
"This show really is outstanding, in fact its the only show i think i can rate as a 10.

From watching the original uk series back in 2001 on bbc TV, i never thought an American remake would stand any ground whatsoever. When the first series aired in the uk it did'nt really make its mark, and unfortunately never caught on. I was disappointed when it disappeared from our screens, and then quickly forgot about it. I thought it had 1 series and crashed and burned. Then one day i was checking out the reviews for evan almighty on IMDb and noticed that steve carel had still been making this show. I had to get hold of it and see it, And to my joy there was 5 series waiting for me. I never get into TV like i have done with this, i ended up watching 10 episodes in a day, i think i did all 5 series in just under 2 weeks. This show is funny, its acted brilliantly, its over the top, totally crazy but totally entertaining. If your ever down just bung on a couple episodes from good old dunder miflin in scranton and you cant go wrong.

Gervais said that 2 series of the office in the uk was enough. And that he did'nt want to take it further. I know he helps on the US version, and i sure he is surprised to see 6 series already of what i can only describe as the best American sitcom of all time!!"
You can't even possibly rate it. Every Character in this show adds to its everlasting message that one can be whoever they want to be without changing themselves cause in the end people would still love you!
"After reading all of the horrible reviews coming from the UK, I felt the strong desire to comment. I learned that most of the reviewers bashing it have only seen a few (at most) episodes from the first season - many haven't seen it at all, and are simply bashing it because of an overwhelming sense of pride in the original. I'd be surprised if this review isn't skimmed over and marked unhelpful by them. Obviously I'm not speaking to all the British, but the majority that unfairly judge this show with little to no basis in the truth.

This whole fanaticism is juvenile and petty. The casts of the US and UK versions love each show. Ricky Gervais even wrote and executive produced a few episodes of the US version. Open your minds, people! Most of the US fans KNOW that it's based on a British version. It has gotten the credit it deserves for being a brilliant and hilarious show.

But the American version is also brilliant and hilarious. I've read comments ranging from 'bad acting' to 'direct copy', neither of which are true. The first season may have had its borrowed bits, but that was to get it on its feet. The second and third seasons have proved that it is a show entirely on its own, with scenarios and characters having NOTHING to do with the UK version at all. The acting is just as convincing and real as the UK version.

I've even read that Michael Scott is devoid of David Brent's humanity! In actuality, Michael Scott is shown as far more human than David Brent, who was more manipulative (albeit, poorly) and heartless. The US version still has the cruel elements of the UK version, but it balances these awkward, painful moments with tender, human moments, which makes it more enjoyable and watchable.

As for the humor, each show has its own moments of subtlety, detail, absolutely outrageous moments, awkwardness, pain, cuteness, ridiculousness, and vulgarity. The UK version was groundbreaking. But instead of blindly basing your opinions on bias and arrogance, see the US version for what it is - a brilliant, brighter version that, in its first season, simply used the framework of the original (the characters and basic situations) to get started with.

This is the funniest, smartest American television show in recent history besides Arrested Development. Not since Seinfeld has a show made me laugh so hard and smile so much. These three shows get better with each viewing and are great because there's so many levels of humor, from the apparent outrageousness to the minute details that are noticed after repeated viewings and are often funnier than the surface material."
"So much to relate too. All the characters, they all had their place, and they all nailed it. Maybe Micheal was a little bit too over the top at times, but your love to hate him is what made him such a good person for the role.

The best part is I felt something of a personal attachment to some of the characters. Really rooting for some, but also rooting against other, and really loving to hate some of the quirky characters. And when the show is all said and done, you love them all. I miss them.

Easily re-watchable. This is a classic. This one will be played out in VR I'm sure when were all plugged into some computer."
"This is the most remarkable and hilarious workplace comedy created in this decade unarguably. I watched all the first 7 seasons inside a few days and I wondered how this show kept me so relaxed and wanting more and more from these characters as the story lines kept me hooked on the ever changing plot. The writers have marvellously twisted the flow of the show adding suspense, a little bit of drama and romance and a whole lot of insanely funny pranks, jokes and it really bond us with the characters. And something I felt unique about this show is that how we felt for Michael when he was desperate with his life although we hated him when he was a nuisance and he added something to the show that I find unexplainable.

So this is one heck of a show and I recently found that Billie eilish had watched this show 12 times! (worth it)."
"A documentary film crew is tasked with recording the daily lives of the employees of the Scranton branch of the Dunder Mifflin Paper Company. The employees turn out to be a wide assortment of characters.

I was never interested in the US version of The Office when it was first released: in fact it has taken me 15 years to watch it! I am a big fan of the UK version and figured the US version was just an Americanised rehash of the UK version and wouldn't do it any justice.

Initially I was proved partially right as the Season 1 largely followed the UK series' plot, down to some of the scenes and jokes. It was still very good though and showed enough originality to make me continue watching. I'm glad I did.

From Season 2 the series finds its own way and what a way it is! Cleverly, charmingly funny but what sets it apart is the emotional and dramatic side. There are some wonderful story arcs and sub-plots, not least of which is the Jim-Pam story. This really is the spine around which the series is built, especially in the earlier seasons. Their story is an incredibly engaging one, made even more captivating by an incredible, off-the-charts-level chemistry between the two actors, John Krasinski and Jenna Fischer.

This is not to say that the other characters and actors play second fiddle. Steve Carrell is fantastic as the boss Michael Scott - very funny and perfect for the role - as is Rainn Wilson as Jim's nemesis, Dwight Schrute. Even the secondary long-term characters have their chance to shine, there is that much breadth to proceedings.

Some of the shine did go off the show when Steve Carrell left. Will Farrell didn't work as a temporary replacement. However, the James Spader-Ed Helms period was great and saw the series almost back to its best.

In the final season you could see that it had run its course though. There was never a bad episode but the comedy didn't feel as fresh and clever as before and the emotional side was missing. This was all made up for with a brilliant, nostalgic, emotional final episode that brought everything full circle. Fantastic way to end a series."
"Everybody Loves Raymond is an all-time classic. It's a sitcom that is hilarious because of how realistic it is. It's your everyday family that will remind you of your own. Even though Ray Romano is the star and very funny it's the supporting cast (Brad Garrett, Peter Doyle, Doris Roberts) which separates this from other great sitcoms. While it may not be the best supporting cast ever it's definitely up there. This is a show that's been done numerous times before but not nearly as well. It's also one of those comedies that you can rewatch as many times as you want and it'll still make you laugh."
Everybody Loves Raymond is just as funny today as it was when it was on 15-20 years ago. If you look up any list of the best sitcoms of all-time I promise you that Everybody Loves Raymond will be on it. It's absolutely hilarious. This is one of those sitcoms where you can watch the reruns over and over and find them just as funny as the first time you saw them. You can have it on in the background while you do other things and just pick up anywhere in the episode and start laughing. The cast is perfect. The show is so funny because it'll remind you of your own family. There are at least a few characters in the show that you'll think was based off someone from your own family.
My favorite character of Everybody Loves Raymond is Robert. Robert is the poor soul whose mother obsesses over Raymond and gets no respect from his father. Raymond is a whiny mother's boy and in order to put up with Raymond and his family Debra is a screeching shrew. Robert is the most tolerable character.
"...but now I'm hooked, and I've even bought 5 DVD boxsets of it! Its weird because its both subtle AND sharp humour.

Its about Ray Romano, a sportswriter who just wants a quiet life...but he has 3 kids (a girl and twin toddler boys) and Debra (his wife) who struggles to juggle housekeeping and being a mother because Ray just will do anything to stay out of her way and not help! Debra is not your typical sitcom mum. She's independent and opinionated, and a very good match for Ray - she keeps him in line!

His Italian American parents (Marie and Frank) and divorced 40 year old brother (Robert) stay in the same street and facing across from Ray & Debra's house. And they are never away from there - The parents are very loud, expressive, overbearing people, but they don't mean to be....It's just their way. The brother is quirky to say the least! he's 7 foot tall and has a voice like Eeyore from the winnie the pooh movies (he IS the voice from the cartoon). He has weird little habits and is a little obsessive compulsive and insanely jealous of his younger brother Ray. However, at heart they are good, caring people and the family are extraordinarily close...but you'd never know it by the drama and shouting that goes on all the time! This is where the comedy comes from....

Now, I am married to an Italian man and I know from experience what Italian in-laws are like! so this might be why I find this so funny....watching Marie (Rays mum) is like watching my MIL (only its not so funny in real life, believe me!!)

If you like Seinfeld, King of Queens (another sitcom which took ages to grow on me), CLASSIC Woody Allen movies, the film Mambo Italiano or My Big Fat Greek Wedding, then you'll like this. Give it a go, watch more than one episode and you'll end up hooked like me - I promise!"
"I enjoyed the series quite a bit. The only weak point was Ray. What a complete ass he was. I never understood why Deborah didn't kick him out long ago. The rest were pretty funny, but he could always spoil an episode. He was consistently self-serving, self-obsessed, sex-obsessed and kind of mean in a sarcastic way. I never liked the way he treated Deborah and thought he treated her like a domestic servant. That doesn't wear very well these days. I liked Robert and Amy a great deal and the interplay between the parents was always pretty funny. I suppose that parents appreciated the twins, but they seemed to be really spoilt and annoying."
Because its pandemic i went back and rewatched some old tv series and this one beeing one of em i gotta say its still funny after 15 yrs.
"Everybody Loves Raymond is just one of those shows you can't get enough of. I remember watching it as a child everyday before dinner, getting excited to watch all the Barone family drama and getting a good laugh out of it, even today. I absolutely love the characters and plot of each episode because as a viewer, you never really know what you're in for or what the Barones have in store for you and that's what makes it stand out in my books. Beautiful. Funny. Hilarious. You name it, this show has it all. If you're looking for a show where you quite literally form a special bond with the characters and stories, then Everybody Loves Raymond is the show for you. Great for the family and kids and never yields to disappoint. 10/10!"
"Fun to watch serie about some italian american family and their daily shenanigans. But there is one thing that starts to ruin the show half way through the seasons. And that one thing is named: Debra. She becomes more toxic the further the series goes on. Constantly yelling, PMS'ing, withholding sex, acting all high and mighty, and just being a well rounded B*TCH! It becomes so bad in some episodes, that i skipped them all together. I'll tell you this...if my wife treated me like that more than once, i would kick her out and divorce her.

This is a perfect example of how feminism turned in toxicity."
"There are things I like about this show, but the one thing I do not like is Raymond. He is so obnoxious! I don't know why the people around him put up with him - and why the show is so-named.

I like most of the other characters. To me, Robert is much the better son. Raymond is entirely self-centred and certainly does not deserve such a lovely wife and children.

I KNOW it's only a show, and entertainment, bit it annoys me that the others seem so oblivious of his faults.

The show is amusing - but certainly not exceptional or deserving of all those awards."
"I love comedies that are consistently funny, many times over, where the laughs don't all necessarily come from script, but from situation and timing. Other examples are The Cosby Show, Family Ties, and The King Of Queens. Now Ray Romano may, not be the best actor in the world, but he's acting comedic timing, in playing this kind of layabout hunky sports columnist writer, Ray, ha ha, is dynamite. His folks are played by two superb actors, who gave such great performances, both who've sadly passed away, one most recently (another sad day in Hollywood). I love household comedies, and this is just another household, I'd loved to be part of. ELR has a high ratio laughs level, and for people to say this is crap, honestly, this has left me dumbstruck. Ray's older, less fortunate, and big cop brother, Robert (Brad Garrett) too has wonderful comic timing, with great character to boot. He never slips up, where in stand up, he's bloody fun. I know too, the kids go very neglected here, with not much time on the acting field, but this is the right decision, on part of the writers, as this would take away, the hours of laughs, or magic within the other characters. ELR is one of the best comedies of the last twenty years, where disregard, totally the bad and unfair criticisms. Wonderful frickin' show, and honestly, how could you hate Raymond?"
"EBLR is one of my favourite shows out there But their are flaws 1. Ray gets a bit annoying sometimes 2. Some parts of the series gets a bit repetitive 3. It gets stupid sometimes

There are a few more downers but that does not mean I dislike Everybody Loves Raymond as it's a very funny show and as I said one of my favourite shows along with Friends and Family Guy.

So for that reason I give Everybody Loves Raymond a 7/10 It's no a perfect TV series but the what is.

This review is my own personal opinion.

"i've never understood the appeal of this show. there are no sympathetic characters, everyone is yelling all the time, and they all appear to hate each other. perhaps that is the family dynamic of the target audience of the show, and if so, it's just another example of the 'lowest common denominator' thinking of Hollywood. how there were enough people to be duped into watching over 200 episodes of this mean-spirited, dull, repetitive dreck i'll never know. it is as though the writers came up with ONE idea for a pilot: a slow-witted dullard marries a conniving, bitter woman who never stops yelling, then moves next door to his parents--a conniving, bitter woman who hates the other conniving, bitter woman, and a grumpy old man; and then never came up with another one. This show is absolutely the nadir of American comedy."
"It's One of the best sitcoms there is. Every character is so strong that not once in the entire series would you feel that someone is out of character. They come up with wittiest responses and funniest circumstances that you can't help but laugh out loud in amusement. This is the only series that I can rewatch after friends and each time I rewatch, it's funny. Please do yourself a favour a go watch it. I envy you if you haven't already done so."
"ELR was a cool show. It wasn't obnoxious and lousey like many before and after its time.

The characters are down to earth. They aren't annoying or have a millennial super-complex.

Ray is like a Seinfeld clone, imperfect, sarcastic with a don't give a fk person a. Unfortunately he's married. So he can't date many women. We are stuck seeing 1 girl he is with for 9 years

ELR was one of those rare gems. When it ended The Big Bang Theory took its place, unfortunately. And the rest is misery.

Verdict: Not every show that can past the 8-10 year milestone is great (Example: The Big Bang Theory). ELR proved that it was one of those shows that were great without having some type of millennial super complex."
"I've been watching this show since I was a kid. I'm 32 now and it's one of my biggest comfort shows ever. I watch it every night when I'm trying to wind down for bed and now that I have a newborn, I watch it when I'm up with him. It's one of the best ever."
"I really enjoyed the comedy the first few seasons. The characters were funny and many of the lines were brilliantly brilliant. One of the unforgettable best episodes was when Robert got into the club scene. Disappointingly each season became increasingly a war of words and insults. Debra's character turned into a raging shrew. I actually started to turn it off mid espisode because of her unrelenting litany of how Ray doesn't know or do anything. It got to the point where I thought she should divorce him because she criticized everything about him. Additionally, the incessant insults to Robert about how he was such a lover was bad enough, but the unnecessary insults about Robert's height were not not kidding in good fun they were mean-spirited."
"I love this show. It's hilarious. It has the weird, over protective, annoying, critical mother, the gross, dim-witted father who yells a lot, the over-looked first born brother, and the ""perfect"" second born son who writes for a newspaper and has a wife and 3 kids. In one way or another, you'll be able to relate with this show. I get mad when I miss an episode, even if I've already seen it. They're all so funny. The acting, writing, and directing are all wonderful. I think it's one of the best shows out there. If you like comedies about real life that aren't cheesy (like those so-called Disney channel comedies) you'll love this show just like I do."
"When David Letterman decided to help Ray Romano put this show on with World wide Pants Productions, nobody knew if it would be a success. Thanks to the great casting of Peter Boyle, Marie Roberts, Patricia Heaton & Brad Garrett, this became the quietest & most successful family sitcom show produced in recent times.

The writing on this show is very good. There is almost not an episode where you can't help but laugh several times. All the characters are well drawn & easy to identify with. It is just entertaining.

The recent death of Boyle just shows how elusive success is & how short it lasts. I can't really think of a sitcom recently that is done better & more consistently than this one was. The situations were always minor plots, but once you watch this for a while, you know exactly how the characters will fit in.

Romano had never acted prior to this series, but the folks around him made him fit in like he had. Patricia Heaton as Ray's wife has an amazing range as the wife who is constantly bothered by the In-Laws. She also is amazing because she could be flexible enough to be the wife of Raymond, but could also be attractive & vivacious when she needed to be.

Brad Garrett is the real discovery on this show. His dead pan type of humor is right on all the time. The In-Laws were perfect too. Many times I have noticed the kids are like not there. I just think with all the other talent, there were a lot of times the kids just did not have enough room to fit in the house.

This show is out on DVD & still being rerun in many markets. While it is not a must see, if there is nothing else to watch, this show always pleases me to watch. I especially got amused by one show where Raymond & Patricia wrestled in the living room. A lot of husbands wouldn't mind wrestling with her."
Was re-watching this last night and my face hurts from laughing! The episode with Robert's new girlfriend (She's the One-- Season 7 ep 9)who prefers a Different topping on her ice cream had me rolling. Ha Hahahahaha one of the BEST episodes and the lightning in the back ground made it feel like a Horror/comedy! Perfection! This Body still Loves Raymond too! :D.
"I Don't Know about some people but this is a very realistic show unlike most other sitcoms. The show is just an exaggerated version of Ray's real life besides being an actor/comedian and the normal-to-be-abnormal North American lifestyle.

I have relatives who get a little too comfortable and cranky in public and at home. I also have unintentional as well intentional family who care and almost criticize in a loving way that sort of embarrasses you.

So basically , this show captures an exaggerated decent-income family in a hilarious manner to create a top-notch entertainment television show!"
"This show is bad. Raymond needs to apologize to his wife in every episode.

I watched this episode where Raymond was being hit by a women at the airport (because he lost his wedding ring), he turned her down and when he got home Debra heard about it and got mad, threw his clothes out of the window and yelled at him.

I find it absurd that in every episode Raymond has to be afraid of his wife, always needing to please her.

I don't like a show that the husband is always stupid and childish and the wife is smart and adult.

Avoid this show if you don't want to feel bad."
"My brother and I just started watching His Dark Materials recently and I have to say I actually ended up enjoying it a lot more than I thought I would. Because we put it off for so long we were able to binge watch all 3 seasons and didn't have to wait years between seasons. I prefer to binge watch anyway because I take in more of the story that way but I'm really glad I didn't have to wait year's between seasons on this show, it made more enjoyable to binge it. Everything about this show was top notch (everything on HBO usually is), the writing, acting, visuals, all of it was great! It starts a little slow while they build their world and characters but I don't mind that because it makes you more invested in the show overall."
"I have to start off by saying I knew absolutely nothing about His Dark Materials going into it. I never read the books or saw the movie (The Golden Compass). The only thing I knew was from the trailer and a couple reviews on what the plot was but from what I read this was a great adaptation. I personally thought it was entertaining from beginning to end. I never got bored for even an episode. I'm glad they were given enough seasons/episodes to tell the entire story and not get cancelled on a cliffhanger or questions not answered. This had a satisfying conclusion. You can tell how much money and attention to detail went into this show because it was absolutely beautiful. James McAvoy, Lin-Manuel Miranda, Ruth Wilson, Dafne Keen and the rest of the cast were all brilliant."
"I've heard a few people complain already that ""It's trying to be ""Harry Potter"".

The first book in the HDM trilogy was published two years BEFORE the first ""Potter"", so y'all can stop that nonsense right now. I like both franchises, but ""His Dark Materials"" is shorter, better written, and has deeper content.

I was let down by the movie adaptation, so I'm very happy to see this new version which can take its time and look and feel more like the book. I'm hoping it's a hit. This series is anything but predictable. I won't spoil it for anyone, but expect the unexpected."
"I have just finished the third and final season, and thoroughly enjoyed all of it. When adaptations of books, either as a film or TV series, stick faithfully to the source material, then generally you get a good result.

All the cast are on top form. Dafne Keen is excellent, James McAvoy is always brilliant, but top marks have to go to Ruth Wilson as Mrs Coulter. Her character is just magnetic and she conveys so much complexity with just the slightest of expressions - it really is an acting masterclass.

I won't discuss the plot, but will only state that the multiverse concept is very well portrayed, the character interactions are written with style and care and the 'demons' are beautifully and realistically rendered.

And I couldn't resist the irony of my review title... :-)"
"Having just binged the three seasons, I'm happy enough to come here and give it a positive review.

First and foremost I think the effects were really something. Everything felt quite immersive, there were rarely times that something felt too fake. Some of the imagery was exactly how I imagined from the books, for example the abyss and the mulefa world.

Some of the performances were amazing and award-worthy. My favourites were Ruth Wilson as Mrs Coulter, Will Keen as Father MacPhail. Simone Kirby as Mary and. Ruta Gedmintas as Serafina. They each really brought their characters to life, from the tensions of Coulter and MacPhail to the serenity of Serafina and the more ordinary yet inquisitive Mary.

Some other portrayals I was less keen on, including the two main characters, though I think they improved towards the end and delivered an impactful finale. I also wasn't completely sold on Asriel, perhaps just a bit too different from my personal image of him. My other gripe is that I felt there wasn't enough time for some characters to be properly fleshed out and felt for, which led to some scenes being less emotional than they could have been.

Regardless, this series overall did the books justice and I would definitely recommend it."
"I read a review on here stating that this show is a rip of the Golden Compass movie...... seriously??! Im just hoping its a joke comment, also why are people giving this such bad reviews? Seems like people these days just dont understand what a book is or how to read one, i loved the movie but the show seems spot on so far, also some people giving out that its on late and wondering why as its a ""kids"" show....if you've read the books you would know it gets very dark. Anyway Loving the show so far, i will be watching every week."
"Holywood nearly ruined these books with a schmaltzy kiddy version 'The Golden Compass' But these books work because they address difficult issues of soul, God, morality, authority, parenthood, death, love and duty. The Disney treatment simply destroys its essence.

So how was episode one? Acting Tick. Script tick. Cinematography and sets, tick tick. This looks like it is going to turn out well. Good production values and it seems as though it will be true to the book with actors who can carry it off. Finally an adaptation that compliments a classic and doesn't have some idiot egotist Director or committee of 'We know what our demographic needs to see and hear' network executives doing a version that paints over a masterpiece."
"It's been a long time since I've read the books, so having none of this seem too familiar wasn't exactly surprising. But the characters I do remember, as well as the setting, and neither of those matched what I imagined all those years ago. Some parts were also altered or removed altogether, for reasons I suspect would make it hard to provide context in moments requiring a narrator to describe something you wouldn't be able to understand by simply watching. Standard book-to-film adaptation stuff.

But none of that matters. They took this story and made it their own. You can see the care for pacing and thoughtfulness in nearly every scene. After the 2007 film this was such a nice thing to experience. The sheer acting talent from the cast doesn't hurt, either, with high points being some of the best I've ever seen anywhere. Ruth Wilson in particular. She really is something else. Formidable. Terrifying. Sad. Simultaneously a monster and a tragic figure. An entire character arc eventually satisfied. James McAvoy, too. He's able to communicate so much with the most subtle expressions on his face. Actors like him elevate the people they work with, and the rest of the cast also did a great job. The only exception to this being Amir Wilson. To be clear, he's not bad. His portrayal of Will was good, initially. It just didn't really work because he's pretty much the same person all the way through. The developing affection for Lyra was also somewhat unconvincing. That's a problem considering how central this is to the actual story. As a result we're not 100% sold on what they mean to each other, which ends up taking us out of it.

Iorek Byrnison needs to be mentioned. This is arguably the coolest character in the story, and while most of how he's portrayed is good they did kind of stumble which made him inconsistent. Trimmed a bit of what should have been given more attention, and some actors interacting with the visual effects didn't sell it. For instance, Lyra would turn away too early in conversation and it would diminish him actually being there. Or critical points felt like they were ""good enough"" to move forward with so they put the scene together without the emphasis. These were significant events in the actual books that left a real lasting impression, but here you'll see it play out, then wonder why it didn't hit as hard compared to having read it. I can only imagine working with these kinds of special effects presented unexpected challenges. None of the other characters felt this way. Only scenes with the bear, which is a real shame because he had such presence in the source material. This one detail really stood out to me.

Overall, this is a great show. If you're a fan of the trilogy it's a good watch. If you're coming in fresh it may take a few episodes to settle in."
"Just, Wow. I had zero expectations going into this series and have not read the books. I said Yes to James McAvoy, as always, and was so glad I did. This is not a children's story. It is dark, very dark. It delves into areas I never would have expected, creates a completely engaging world and unfolds the most wonderful story in a masterful manner. The acting is top notch, with an impressive effort by Dafne Keen and just a stunning performance from Ruth Wilson.

Most commendable in the writing is the examination of complicated relationships, even toxic ones. It does not provide simplistic resolutions, but ones that are as equally complicated. It is a beautiful love story. It is also a sweeping adventure, the pursuit of faith and the quest of knowledge. The story continued to evolve and just grew exponentially in such a way that completely surprised me.

For those who love stories, this one is for you. I don't grade many things above 8. Very few. I give this series 9 stars. If I'm honest, it's probably a 9.5...

I just want to thank everyone who put this together, because they have brought me so much joy. I haven't enjoyed anything this much in a very long time. Thank you!"
"I haven't read the books, but I know many people have commented that this series is more faithful than Hollywood's Golden Compass. No surprises there!

I've loved Ruth Wilson since she was in Luther, and she is no less brilliant in HDM. Even though the storyline and cast of characters are quite involved, there's no difficulty in following what's happening. Even the daemons are ""believable "".

You don't have to delve too deeply into the hidden meanings and sub texts: you can just enjoy it for the adventure it is. But, you CAN, if you want, think quite deeply about the issues behind the storyline. Thought provoking to say the least.

I love it."
"Even though I never read the books, I KNOW this is based off of them. Other reviews suggesting that this is a waste of money and comparing it to The Golden Compass, even they are one and the same except the series is far superior because it can actually delve into the source material. People need to do a little research and quit being lazy before spouting off about something they know nothing about obviously.

I've seen other series get the same treatment because people don't read or do research. So annoying. Anyway the show is great. Yes, the movie only got the tip of the iceberg. The show actually goes deeper into the relationships of characters and their backgrounds. The acting is good. The actors are fantastic. And it is British because it's supposed to be.

Give it three episodes before you throw it away due to crappy reviews giving this show the shaft."
"I thought season 1 and 2 were quite good, but season 3 has proved to be a disappontment. Every episode is too long and very slow. I can understand that the purpose is to give it a more spiritual or psychological complexity, but I think it feels mostly melodramatic.

And I can't really come to terms with the acting. Most of the actors seem bored themselves with the show and act rather sloppy or are over-doing it. Such a shame because I think the storyline is interesting and entertaining and should have been handled with better care.

I must add that i haven't read the books so I don't know if the show is true to the original story."
"Given the frustration of The Golden Compass being an incomplete movie, I was excited to see another attempt at the source material with this TV series. But after several episodes I still find myself preferring the movie. Now I'll admit this is an unfair starting comparison. There are three major problems I have with the series so far.

The first is Lyra's complete lack of personality. Book Lyra is a nearly uncontrollable adventurer and liar/storyteller, the latter of which is a crucial element to her personality that proves decisive throughout the story and her later growth as a person. Yet Dafne Keen's Lyra is simply missing that part of the character! The show may be following the original story reasonably closely for now, but major deviations in both story and character personalities will be required further down the road unless the producers are counting on viewers already knowing what will happen.

The second problem is that the daemons are conspicuously absent for all but the main characters, and even then only Pantalaimon and, to a lesser extent, Hester and the Golden Monkey, are really given any screen time. This is problematic because daemons are extensions of every person in the universe; cutting them out quite literally reduces a character to nothing. Like Lyra's missing personality, daemons are crucial to the story and cannot be ignored.

Finally, the show is just so slooooow. The first two books in the series are not long books and don't dawdle at any particular event. I think 8 episodes is too many to cover the first book. Perhaps the first book would have been better suited for 5, maybe 6 episodes.

Or better yet, a 2 1/2 hour movie! Which is what we nearly got over a decade ago until New Line Cinema panicked when they realized they weren't getting the movie that they expected and then chopped off the ending and (somewhat clumsily) rearranged the remainder of the second half. If they ever were to release the original version of the movie, I think I know which adaptation I'd prefer.

That all being said, the series is still well-designed, if perhaps a different vision of the world from the books and the film, with a solid score and visuals (minus the missing daemons). I question the drawing of material from outside the first book, but am willing to go with it. The early scenes involving Will also look promising for his character."
"(I've read the books several times) Episode 1- I was looking forward to this and it hasn't disappointed! (a first for me, with fantasy adaptations) Plenty of money has been thrown at this series and it shows, in a good way. Yet there's nothing Hollywood about it, it's 100% British.

We're treated to a good bit of the background story during this episode, a thankless task, skilfully done and quite quickly. We're immediately thrown into the action and I am hooked, even though I know what's coming.

The sets are amazing, the music excellent, the cast is A1: this is the BBC so it is exceptionally diverse -which is already giving us a bunch of fine actors that might not be so famous and gives us a bit of modern colour. I'm not sure yet about Lyra, she's not what I expected but I've the feeling she'll turn out to be what was needed, if not what I wanted. Lord Asriel is just the right mixture of downright attractive and breezily self-centered as in the books. As to Mrs Coulter she's just fantastically and dangerously attractive. I finally understand what Lyra loved in her. The Gyptians are represented perfectly and individually and the whole thing has a tint of alternate medievality which mirrors the book exactly.

All in all, episode 1 is a success.

I could go on and on but really, just watch it, you'll know after twenty minutes whether you'll like it or not.



Episode 2: some fair deviations from the book, all in aid of story comprehension, suspense and doling appetising spoilers from much later to the viewer so that they won't drop off - you can't blame them really, they need to keep the viewership interested, considering the price of production. It's still very well done, and it's quite scary and tense, also the modern world (already shown) has been updated to current times. It looks like episode 3 will carry on with being rather different from the book storyline, while sticking to it at the same time, if that makes sense. It's rather on the dark side, and definitely not for children the way the books are.

Episode 3: I had minor doubts with episode 2 and the ""new"" storylines but this episode was very exciting and has allayed them. The whole thing is now moving forward properly and the plot is very tight in an action TV series sort of a way, without losing the spirit of the books. Back to a 9.

The following episodes are a bit hit and miss, some pacing/acting /directing issues - Lee Scoresby the one unmitigated success - trying too hard to force suspense to fit the tv format rather than concentrate on telling the story as a one whole, but the last episode packs a punch and gets to you. And really leaves you hating having to wait a year for the rest, excellent finish.

UPDATE SERIES 2:

While there were a few pacing/acting issues in series 1, the first 2 episodes of series 2 are nail-bitingly near perfect. Absolutely brilliant beginning and better visuals than ever. The plot and the world's are really well handled in every particulars. Persevere if you were in two minds about series 1."
"Much better than expected. When they made the movie ""The golden compass"" I was disappointed. The series so far has been closer to the books. And having Lin-Manuel Miranda as Lee was the best casting in the series. I just finished season two and will soon start three. I rarely rate before I finish but this one deserves it.

Keeps with the dark side of the books unlike the movie. They didn't clean it up for kids. I won't give spoilers but if you are a book fan and worry they messed it up, they didn't. If you've never read the books it's easy to follow as they leave very little in explaining out. 8 is very high. It would have been a 7 had it no been for Lin-Manuel and his delightful performance of Lee."
"As a huge fan of the books my expectations were sky high and I really haven't been disappointed. Page and screen are such different media there is no way one can adapt to the other without making certain changes to make it work. For me the changes for this, expanding certain plotlines and introducing some concepts earlier, slightly changing and expanding the roles of some characters has really worked and served the adaptation and storytelling well. The pace has been of a confident slow build, really inhabiting the world and has eskewed adding unnecessary axtra action sequences to satisfy the more impatient. Genuine family entertainment that rewards attention and patience, I can't imagine a better adaptation without tripling the production budget, though they may need that by season 3."
"I'm past episode 8, and an exciting, well done visual copy of the book has turned into soap opera, where everybody keeps talking to each other and hardly anything happens. In season 2, things pick up again. I started reading the book again, and the TV series does seem to do a good job, so far, in staying with the story in the book. It's hard to capture on screen what words can convey. But in place of good writing, there's good scenery and background (we see better than we understand through words). I also have to admit that the movie is aimed at a different audience than the book (watchers instead of readers). So I'll keep on watching. The overall story is interesting and clever, and of course the acting is fine. I've learned that the author has another series of books, Dust, which helps me stay with the story, knowing that the end is not the end. I'll end with a secret: clicking on the response to ""Does this review contain spoilers?"" may stop the admonition that 600 words (or was it letters) haven't been written."
"I'd say any hype around this series is based purely on the fact that more of the book's content is going to be shown (versus the film) and not about the acting or the portrayal of the ideas in the book (e.g. the intimacy of human-dæmon bond).

Visually it's quite good, and it's nice they're able to show parts of the book that a film wouldn't be able to, but I've found there's something lacking in this series. The acting is a little bit stale and it fails to draw you in and keep you invested. It's just not as gripping as the book. There's also a big verbal emphasis on the significance of dæmons but it isn't physically shown, i.e. there's almost no affection shown between (in particular) the kids and their dæmons, which means the relationship Mrs. Coulter has with her dæmon is shown as less significant than it should be."
"This series was one of the best book to television adaptations i've seen. The writing is amazing, and adds an extra layer of detail to the story, giving interesting insights to parts of the novels that were 'left up for interpretation'. The ending was great, and i felt like they did a good job in the third season with the republic of heaven - it could have been easy to loose track of Will and Lyra's story amongst Asriels war, but that's was never the case. The acting was amazing on all parts, Ruth Wilson as Ms Coulter especially. The way they brought the dæmonds to life was also incredibly well done. The only question i have after finishing this series, is why haven't we got a book of dust spin off confirmed to be in the works yet?"
"I watched His Dark Materials, and the First 2 Seasons Introduced a Magical World and an Interesting Storyline.. I Could Hardly Stop Watching the Episodes as Each Episode Managed to Pull Me Further into the Realm of the Story..

Each Episode and Each Newly Introduced Character Managed to Add to the Excitement of the Series, and It became just Hard to Predict what lays Beyond the Next Curve or to Foresee Future Events..

I Loved the First 2 Seasons, and I believe that Each Character made its Fair Contribution to the Story.. and Each Had its Touch.. I Really Believe that it would be hard to find 2 Persons Cheering for the Same Character..

Well, my Only Preservation was the Lack to Provide a Great Actor, Such as James McAvoy a More Screen Time during the first 2 Seasons.. Most Probably because the Producers were Trying to Apply Cost Control, and to use his Presence Extensively in Season 3.. Never the Less, His Presence was Still Tangible and He Managed to Influence the Events to a Certain Extend.

The 2 Seasons were Very Much Family Oriented as it was Almost Impossible to Come Across any Scene with high Intimacy, which Made the Series Perfect for the Family Watch..

The 3rd Season, on the Other hand.. was a Great Disappointment.. The Full Season Could have been Cut to 3 Episodes, if not for the Side and UNNECESSARY Events, and the Lots of Dialogues where the Characters Kept Recapping Events.. also, the Usual LGBTQ was Introduced in this Season just to Comply with the Demand of Media, which ALSO had no Place but to Satisfy the Checklist... Include LGBTQ, Checked.. Target Achieved.. Also, the Ideas that were Adopted in the Season were.... Totally Unexplainable.. I Tried HARD to Digest the Concept, but understanding the Main Purpose is where I Failed.. added to the other observations that Made me feel that the Series went under a Heavy Budge Cut and the Produces are Trying to Cut their Losses Rather than Ending the Series.."
"I was bored one night and decided to watch his dark materials. Honestly the first episodes didn't do much for me at first but i kept going as time progressed i was hooked!

Eve though a bit childish elements to it but it is certainly a huge adventure it takes you on! Abolsutley magical in every other way. I dont have much critisism for this, it was beautifully and elegantly done.

His dark materials explores rather adult subjects like pain, trauma, and how complicated a person can be. Novody is entierly good or bad, which is such a fresh take on the usual black and white, good or evil, heaven and hell type of movies and rethorics even in our own society.

This was such a treat! Give it a chance to grow on you."
"Having never read the books i was enthusiastic to see how the stories would be protrayed in a series.

It does take a bit of patience, as with anything that is adapted. The key is to keep the viewers attention. Ultimately, it did.

I was uneasy on Dafne Keen at the beginning, i was a little weary as to how this character was going to play out, but she wound up doing a fantastic job.

I think the casting directors did a great job. The synchronicity with the voices and ""daemons"" were selected with great accuracy. The effects were great, and again, the daemon's were a highlight of the series.

Now on to the bad stuff....

Not much to say here. A lot of editing, naturally. When you have adaptations they can go one of two ways. They can Go Narnia, or they can go Twilight. Narnia was done very well and Twilight a self-indulgent abomination that should never have been made.

This was a Narnia.

I was able to see past the necessary edits and pick up on things without need of an explanation. But what was unforgivable was the final episode.

It made me go from wondrous, to disgruntled, to melancholic to just plain annoyed and depressed. They should have done more with the departures of two certain characters in the previous episode (without giving anything away) that was done poorly with little-to-no real build up, just a lot of unnecessary dialogue.

The final episode was a bunch if narrative laden drivel, getting their cheap shots in, insulting the viewers. The impartialism was what made the show work. But when you start force-feeding us the same old bullish that we've had to endure for years now, they may as well have spit in our face.

Taking a full point off for the final episode. Should have made an extended episode previously, because this one was literally not needed. The first half to two thirds of the episode were complete gibberish. Absolutely pointless.

Sometimes you change things, like the ending, like they did in ""The Watchmen"" because it fit with modern society. But this could not possibly have been the original ending, and just some tripe to hard-sell youths their never ending agenda and narrative. Makes me sick.

Entertainment Value - 7/10 Overall Rating 7/10 (would have been an 8 but some people can't let a good thing be without spoiling it. Pointless final episode. That is NOT how you end a series. What a waste.)

Also Jame McAvoy and Ruth Wilson crush it. Was very happy to see Ruta Gedmintas as Serafina Pekkala, great choice. (I thought Eva Green would have been great in that role too... turns out there was a movie before this that I also did not watch. Touché hollywood)"
"I wanted to like this. I really did. This book series has been my favorite for a long time, having read through the series three times now. And while I criticized the Golden Compass movie adaptation years ago, I now oddly miss it, for all it's shortcomings. What this adaptation does is assume that it's audience is stupid and unimaginative. Unlike the books where we get to experience the world that is so like ours but so very different through Lyra's eyes, we're told immediately right off the bat in text that that's the case. This first episode should be held as a shining example of how to ""tell, not show"". The amount of overblown exposition and lack of any emotional connection to the characters is staggering. The pacing is incredibly fast... I felt like they covered FAR too much in the first episode for you to get any meaningful sense of the world and Lyra. Unlike the books where you uncover the tension and plot along with Lyra, the plot is thrown at you through arguably trite performances. I felt like few actors had any subtly, and honestly I never thought I would yearn for Nicole Kidman and Daniel Craig back. While Dafne Keen looks the part in my minds eye far more than her predecessor, she's given little to do and some fairly uneven and obnoxious dialogue. The CGI daemons are beautiful at times but also somewhat unsuccessful. The smaller pole cats and ermine's feel believable enough but Azriel's snow leopard lacks any of the weight and presence that the movie version had years ago.

I'm curious to see where this goes, and while I'm glad to see this story get screen time once again, I hardly think that this is the adaptation this book deserves. I admit the book is a glorious spider's web of chaos and complexity, but there is still a spark amidst all of it, and a passion that shines through. I get none of that from this show. The editing, cinematography and color grading all scream BBC. And I don't mean that in a good way. Everything just feels mildly pedestrian. The movie at least succeeded at having a cohesive point of view in its art direction, the art direction here seems a bit all over the place with little real point of view.

Maybe the book is unadaptable. I don't know. But I knew I was in for a bumpy ride when I had the world described to me in four sentences before I ever even set foot in it.

Maybe in another ten years we'll figure it out."

If we don't have immunity or deamon tools, almost any speech from this rostrum can be used to sue for insult and defamation. I am referring to the series of insults and insinuations, which for that to restore common sense as well, have been making to each other in recent years dark spells or coldest weapon of all..!?

"""The Pacific"" is Tom Hanks and Steven Spielberg's epic 200 million dollar miniseries from the creators of the brilliant 2001 series ""Band Of Brothers'. Much like with Band Of Brothers, The Pacific gives us an unflinching look at the horrors of war, not just the physical but the mental horrors these men must face. As an audience you are pulled through this experience, watching in horror as limbs are torn from bodies and men are burned and mutilated. In a way even more distressing is watching the emotional scars and effects this has on our main characters. This is not a perfect series and does suffer from some major flaws but overall it's an extremely harrowing experience but one that is needed in an age where war is often glorified, this series does anything but that.

Narrative and overall story: The Pacific is based primarily on two memoirs of U.S. Marines, With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa by Eugene Sledge and Helmet for My Pillow by Robert Leckie. The miniseries follows both these marines Sledge (played by joe mazzello) and Leckie (James Badge Dale) there is also the addition of marine John Basilone (Jon Seda) but he is a lesser focus. Now unlike Band of Brothers we follow these characters separately as they are part of different divisions, the first few episodes follow Leckie and his experiences, the latter on Sledge. In a way this is both an interesting way of narration but also maybe the biggest flaw of the series.

This spilt narration gives us two very separate journeys which in a way bonds us closer to the characters. The downfall is that Leckie's story is just simply not as interesting as Sledges, from the moment Sledge is introduced to us i felt an instant sympathy and connection with him, here is this shy, awkward eighteen year old desperately longing to fight in the war but unable to do so thanks to a heart mummer, of course his determination gets the best of him and enlists. The character and his overall story is simply miles more compelling than Leckie's thats what makes the first three or four episodes somewhat lackluster. When the sole focus is on Sledge this series reaches its incredible potential and becomes something truly amazing, Sledge and his journey is really the heart and soul of this series.

Acting: With such a depressing and intense subject matter first class acting was expected and the pacific delivers. Every single cast member gives a great performance, its gripping and believable acting at its best. The stars are undoubtedly Joe Mazzello who plays Sledge and Rami Malek who plays Corporal Merriell Shelton or ""Snafu"", a highly intriguing character who forms a close friendship with Sledge. Both give Emmy worthy performances and in Malek's case i would say Oscar worthy. These are two very complex and incredible performances. Mazzello plays our lead which such an intense and subtle power: his character goes from a naive and passive teenager to hardened killing machine full of rage it is an incredible character arc and Mazzello plays it to perfection. As the series comes to a close we really see what Mazzello can do: Sledge is beginning to lose himself, he has become ruthless and in one single pivotal scene he regains his humanity, his compassion and his redemption. Its a truly powerful scene and one in which Mazzello does not utter one word, his face says everything and its heartbreaking. In fact that is Mazzello main strong point, his ability to convey much more than what is going on just by his eyes and face, there is so much complex emotion behind his eyes it makes for a fascinating watch. Rami Malek gives the most impressive performance of the series playing ""Snafu"". His character is incredibly creepy and odd, obviously numbed by the horrors of the war, but there is something there that makes the audience warm to him. Malek completely becomes the role, every mannerism, twitch, blink of the eye is perfectly done. lines such as ""I like to watch the new guys sweat."" are said with such odd intensity its actually mind blowing. I will call this performance perfect which is a very rare thing indeed, if only Malek could win an Oscar because this performance truly deserves the highest acclaim. Malek and Mozzello also have fantastic chemistry, playing off each other perfectly helping to only further this touching friendship.

Direction: remember the opening sequence of ""Saving Private Ryan""? well imagine that times 20. I would say this is the most realistic portrayal of what an actual battle must have felt like. The battle scenes are simply epic and wonderfully directed, even if you hate everything else anyone can see the direction is incredible within this series.

Overall: the major flaw of this series if the first 4 episodes they simply don't have the emotional impact of the rest, in fact they border on dull. However as soon as Sledge and Snafu become our main focus this series becomes a true epic. This series will take you on a haunting experience, you will be horrified, you will be moved, you will laugh, you will cry. As long as you stick with it through the first few episodes you will not regret it."
"If you want to see the Pacific version of HBO's critically acclaimed ""Band of Brothers"", change the channel

""The Pacific"" differs from ""Band of Brothers"" whereas the ""The Pacific"" focuses on the war itself and ""Band of Brothers"" focused on the characters. Both miniseries are championed by Hollywood heavy-hitters Tom Hanks and Steven Spielberg who were contributing writers and producers of both miniseries.

Perhaps the greatest distinction between the two mini-series was intentional. It is clear that the soldiers in the Pacific theater fought a different kind of war than those fighting in Europe. ""The Pacific"" is a gritty if not gory depiction of a war against not just the Japanese, but also the elements. The cast is made-up of some brilliant actors we are sure to see again in future projects. What makes ""The Pacific"" so good is the intense realism which brings the viewer into the battle from the safety of your couch. If there is hell on earth, you will find it here.

The army they are fighting is alien; both mysterious and ferocious. They are looked at with both awe and disdain and the Americans want to kill them all. However, there is a palpable sense fear among the men that this enemy will never surrender and will fight beyond what they feel is humanly if not morally possible. When one character hears about the Kamikaze's flying their planes into ships, he asks aloud ""how can any man do that?"" ""The Pacific"" is fast-paced and each episode leaves the viewer wanting more.

What lacks in the series is the intimacy of knowing the characters. They are kept at a distance almost as if the character doesn't want to let you in. This may be the intent of the writers; just as the soldiers took little interest in knowing each other, maybe we are not meant to know the characters."
"I'm guessing most of us watched 'The Pacific' for at least one of the following 3 reasons:

1. We have an interest in history, particularly in WW2.

2. We are fans of movies and television shows (well, the good ones anyway)

3. We had seen - and loved - the previous Hanks/Spielberg co-production 'Band Of Brothers' and expected a mini-series on the same level.

Now from reading some of the reviews here I gather that third reason was the most important one for many viewers - and it's also why 'The Pacific' apparently left quite a few people disappointed. As for me, I wasn't disappointed - I was devastated.

I'm a lucky man; I've never had to suffer through a war. But I had relatives who did, and though they're all long gone now, I'll never forget their stories. War is the most extreme and outrageous experience humans can possibly endure, but there are many different aspects and layers to it, because a war is not a single experience: it's all the experiences of all the individuals who have to suffer through it, and no single film or TV show can cover all of them. 'Band Of Brothers' focused on certain aspects of a war, and it chose a narrative that helped emphasize what the core theme of the series was: the brotherhood of war. It was about people who retain their humanity and form the closest of bonds under the worst, most horrific circumstances.

That inherently human element in 'BoB' was also why we could identify so well with the protagonists, and why we were - and still are - so deeply touched by what they had to go through. It's an outstandingly well made series, and I can't imagine how those experiences by those soldiers could have been portrayed better. Which is why 'The Pacific' doesn't even try. Instead, it goes almost in the opposite direction by choosing to focus on the sheer insanity of war: the relentless horror and despair of people losing their humanity and their struggle to regain it. Of course, just like 'BoB' it's also about the heroic sacrifices of those brave soldiers, but if there is a core theme in 'The Pacific' it's that of trauma: the trauma of having your humanity stripped from you and your personality shattered; the trauma of witnessing the complete disintegration of everything you thought you were and knowing you'll never be whole again.

What we see in 'The Pacific' is Hell, plain and simple. It's scores and scores of anonymous, young Japanese soldiers running senselessly into machine gun fire, wave after wave, until the piles of their bodies are so high they block the sight for the machine gun; it's American soldiers barely older than kids in despair or completely numb from the sheer amount of random death around them; it's vibrant young men turning into barely alive husks whose only remaining focus is to survive - which means they have to kill other barely alive young men who will stop at nothing to kill them in turn; it's kids killing other kids like rats by any means at their disposal: guns, knives, flame-throwers or with their bare hands; it's people living among the rotting corpses of their dead comrades and enemies and completely losing any regard for human life. And the few moments where we witness how those kids get a brief taste of how precious and beautiful life could be make their fate all the more heartbreaking.

Over large stretches, 'The Pacific' is devastating and depressing to watch, and though I found it never less than compelling, it's actually easy to see why many viewers who had hoped for a similarly engaging experience as in 'BoB' were left disappointed. But this is a different story about different people who fought in a different theater of the war and who went through different experiences, and once you stop comparing it to the story of the men in Easy Company from 'BoB', you'll find that, while different, in terms of sheer quality 'The Pacific' is every bit as good and as much of an outstanding achievement as its more popular predecessor.

The realism, the performances, the music and the production values in the series are superb (this was a 200 million production after all), and the attention to historic detail is simply staggering. As for me, witnessing what these men went through left me devastated; yet I am grateful I've watched 'The Pacifc': because in its relentless depiction of the horrors of war it honors the sacrifice these brave young soldiers made in the hope future generations wouldn't have to do the same. I originally rated this series 9 stars out of 10, but upon a recent rewatch and with more knowledge of the war in the Pacific theater, it's clear that this is a 10/10. Outstanding.

"The war in the Pacific was a hell of a lot different than the war in Europe. Of course both where terrible - full of death, sacrifice, and heroism. However, it seems the soldier's stories from the European theater have gotten a lot more press.

The US Marines in the Pacific lived like animals in the most horrible environments imaginable. On top of fighting an enemy committed to kill them at all cost and never surrender, they battled the mud, heat, malaria, near starvation, and isolation for months on end.

Basically, it was a total nightmare, and the heroism of all the US Marines in the Pacific theater is nothing short of awe inspiring. The Pacific tells this story well. It is a must see on the topic of WW2."
"Please, for the love of God, please do not overlook this miniseries. I have seen way too many people who don't bother to see The Pacific because it wasn't like Band of Brothers. This was in no way, shape, or form meant to be like BoB. If you have studied WW2 at all, you would know that the war in the Pacific was a totally different war than the European theater.

I loved Band of Brothers, it was a great and realistic series of the harsh realities of warfare and the scars it can leave. The Pacific was much harder to watch than BoB ever was. BoB was all about the bonds formed in combat and how this can tear people apart. This grim series displayed how completely unprepared the US military was mentally for how truly horrific this war would be. Not only were you fighting the unpredictable and relentless Japanese soldiers, but you were also fighting the terrain. The dense woods, the heavy rain, the thick mud. Not to mention all the diseases that came with these harsh conditions. Water was a luxury in a lot of situations. The filmmakers brilliantly showed how this affected the fighting men, who became virtually hollow shells, their sanity teetering on the edge of their knives.

The Japanese killed everyone without remorse. One particular scene that gave me chills to witness was in the latter half of the series when a group of civilians was slaughtered by a Japanese machine gun nest while running to the American forces. One person, a child, started to crawl slowly to the lines, a couple bullet wounds on his body. One of the combat rookies wanted to run in to help the poor boy, but was kept back so they would not be shoot too. All the Marines could do was watch, as the helpless child was brutally killed after a bullet from that machine gun emplacement hit him in the back of the head and his body went limp instantaneously.

This is on par with Saving Private Ryan, another collaboration between Tom Hanks and Steven Spielberg, as one of the most horrific, gruesome, and realistic war dramas ever put to film. I highly recommend giving it a watch, but be warned: this series is not for the faint of heart."
The Pacific miniseries will leave many of you in a state of awe. What a cinematic achievement. The best of the best of what American entertainment has to offer. The scenes and emotions portrayed are so vivid and lifelike that you'll think you've been transported back in time to the pacific theater of war. History has told us how horrid the war against the Japanese was. A war of attrition. This series will take you there and slap you on the wrists and then the face and remind you of the truth. War is utter diabolical hell. And the guys that fought in the pacific during WW2 were tough as nails. Tougher. It's ugly and beautiful at the same time. Enjoy and take a history lesson. You'll thank your lucky stars you did.
"Simply phenomenal, great acting, incredible battle scenes and gripping emotion. Spielberg is pure genius. Historically close on many levels and really conveys what it must have been like for these heroes, like my dad."
"The Pacific... every time I come across this series I always want to watch it again. The show really shows you what the soldiers that fought in WW2 felt and went through. It's series like this that keep the memory of those brave soldiers who fought for their country alive. And also, the opening theme is... Just hear it for yourself."
"I'm Australian and it's ANZAC day today where the whole country honours all those who have served our country and others in all theatres of war. I judge The Pacific as a dramatic representation of the war in the Pacific, not a 100% historically accurate documentary.

I'm so glad The Pacific is on, because it highlights part of the war that was so vital to my country. I might not be Australian today if our allied forces hadn't won the battles. Maybe because I grew up with a significant focus on the impacts of the war with the Japanese, I get a lot from the show and when I watch it I feel how awful it was for the marines and all who were there, and how Australia was the closest safe haven for those men and women. Just seeing a brief mention of the starvation, tropical ulcers, how important it was to stop the Japanese airstrip on Guadalcanal, the Japanese mentality, is enough for me to get a lot out of the show. I already know how long it went on for, and that the battles were many and varied.

Think the Burma railway, Changi, Kokoda, and I realise the enormity of what these people went through, they were skeletons in rags if they manged to survive and come out of there. The Japanese bombed Darwin, there were submarines in Sydney Harbour, and just last year, we finally discovered the wreck of a hospital ship that he Japanese torpedoed and sank, just off Brisbane. The college I attended was turned into a US army hospital base in WWII and has miles of underground tunnels. MacArthur's base in Brisbane is still named after him, it's now a shopping centre, MacArthur Central. The anniversary of the battle of the Coral Sea a few years ago in Townsville was huge.

The Pacific is a great show for me. I like it, I appreciate what they're representing in the short time they have to do it in a TV show. Just a quick look at someone who says goodbye to family in a snowy climate and then lands on a tropical island speaks volumes about what they faced to me. If it brings even a small amount of appreciation to others who are not as familiar with this part of WWII, The Pacific has done a great job. I give it a thumbs up.

For another interesting story set around this time, check out the movie Paradise Road."
"I enjoyed this series very much and can see why there has been so many comparisons with Band Of Brothers. My observation is that in The Pacific many of the characters lack depth and development. The result was that I cared less when ill befell them than I did in Band of Brothers. I think that the first episode could have contained a lot more time letting us get to know the characters better before throwing them into battle.

The battle scenes were done very well and played very realistically. All in all HBO has done it again. Without the HBO and Showtime I think that US grown TV drama would be pretty thin on the ground. The Pacific is well worth the time."
"I couldn't tell you how many times I have watched Band of Brothers. I think it is the best production ever made. However, I resisted watching The Pacific. My father had five years active duty in the Marine Corps when I was born, and remained on active duty until I was 30 years old. I was ten when he left for Viet Nam, the first time, and in high school the next. I had friends whose fathers were seriously wounded, or killed, there. I have always felt like Marines are family, and any depiction of them being killed has always been hard to see. However, I finally decided to ""man-up"" and watch it, on Veteran's Day this year.

I think BoB was a dream come true for the producers. They had ironclad characters to follow all the way through, and many of the men were still alive and took part in it. The story of Easy company had been put into book form, brilliantly. They didn't have that with The Pacific. The closest they could come was to base it all around three separate men; Robert Leckie,Eugene Sledge and John Basilone. The three men's paths crossed, some,but they did not belong to the same units or know each other, although Leckie and Sledge both knew Basilone's reputation.

As brutal and difficult as the war in Europe was, the Pacific war against the Japanese was almost incomprehensible. Except for their time in Australia, following Guadalcanal, they were fighting the most brutal fights in history, while in the most punishing places on earth.It is a wonder that any of them were ever able to return to civilization and dull the memories of those horrors enough to lead a more or less normal life.

Because of the brutality of both the enemy and the conditions they had to live and fight under, there isn't much in the way of light-heartedness. The Pacific is not as enjoyable as BoB. Anyone seeing it for the first time should not expect to be entertained. It is a bit more difficult to get into. I found it helpful to watch the first episode twice before going on. A little patience in getting to know the primary characters payed off. I also think being able to watch it all over the course of a few days, like I did, was much better than watching it as it was first presented, one episode each week for ten weeks.

There were some excellent performances in The Pacific. Someone else singled out Ravi Malek's portrayal of Merriel ""Snafu"" Sheldon as award worthy and I agree 100%! I loved William Sadler as LtCol. Lewis ""Chesty"" Puller, and I was also very impressed with Tom Budge as PFC Ronnie Gibson.

The three primary characters are portrayed worthily. I didn't think Joe Mazzello as Sledge developed his character as well as the other two. However, I ended up with only nine episodes on my DVR. The one I am missing is episode five, which I suspect is centered on Sledge, so perhaps the character will seem better developed to me after I see it. Jon Seda gave a fine performance as John Basilone, which was definitely the roll of a lifetime! I think my favorite of the three was James Badge Dale, as Bob Leckie.

I wasn't as depressed by seeing a portrayal of so many Marines being killed and wounded as I expected. That was partly because not many of them really looked like Marines to me. I have always said that you can put an actor in the Marine Corps uniform but you usually can't make him look like a Marine. There were a few, though, who were totally believable including Jon Seda. Others have commented on the length of the men's hair as being distracting and/or inaccurate. By my first memories, in the mid-late 50s, Marines were wearing the crew-cuts and flat-tops that they have worn ever since. However, I have pictures of my dad in uniform, from a decade earlier, with longer hair, so I think the producers knew what they were doing there.

Although I agree with most posters here, that The Pacific is not as good as BoB, it is still well-done and definitely worth seeing. I think watching it with an open mind, and avoiding comparisons, it is a good way to approach it.

One last comment I have is that I wonder why one young Marine, who was killed on Iwo Jima at age 17, was singled out in the tributes at the end. I assume they meant that to symbolize the thousands of young men who were killed, and it was very effective, IMO. But I would be interested to know why they chose the one they did; if perhaps someone involved in the production was a relative of the young man. I won't say his name for those who might not have seen it yet, but I will always remember it."
"Rating: 7/10

Themes: World War II, History, Drama, Action, Marines, Americans vs. Japanese, Trauma & Relationships.

Review: The premise of this show had the potential for a gut-wrenching story filled with heart and grief, but it didn't manage to fully live up to that potential for me. This series definitely succeeded in showing the violence and hopelessness that went with being at war, but I struggled a little bit with the emotional factor. It lacked some depth for me there, and I was expecting more from it. The pacing was a little off as well and the structure wasn't the best. I have to say I thought the series did get better over time, and the first half truly felt different from the second half. In any case, this was an interesting watch, but it could have been more."
"I am a great fan of the original Band of Brothers and do realize that some of us do not get the feeling of getting close to the individuals as we did with BoB. The Pacific theater was different. The Japanese warfare was, and I suppose still is, different. I do not believe that it is fair to compare Pacific to BoB. We are trying to compare Apples and Oranges. I think that this miniseries is a great piece of historical story telling. Having read some complaints about the historical accuracy of the statement made in episode 3. What a wonderful thing that there are people out there that know the real history. Is it not a good thing that this miniseries actually gets us involved? That some, if not most of us, actually go and try to learn more about what had happened? Is it not a good thing that we hear names like Basilone ( a real hero), E.B.Sledge, and Robert Leckie? Normal people that have performed and endured in an utmost,and admirable way. If this miniseries has the power in getting our younger generation interested in this part of our history, it has done a wonderful thing. I would recommend for anybody watching this series to go and investigate the facts, read and educate oneself about the soldiers that fought for our freedom and for democracy. The only negative thing about this series is that the episodes are to short and the 7 days between episodes is to long. To all the Veterans past and present, thank you."
"Well, it is no where as good as Band of Brothers, but the focus is too different. It doesn't stay on a single company and because of that, you kind of don't get what you expected...

...and what you expected is Band of Brothers in the Pacific theater and, well, without the same company to follow through the war, it doesn't give you that feel of brotherhood that made Band of Brothers so loved.

However, you do get a sense of how brutal it was, much more so than the European theater. And that is another source of complaints. People thought it was carnage candy when, the Pacific was actually just carnage.

So, really, its a misunderstood cousin."
"This show is equally important to BOB, both are amazing and well made, This side of the war is not talked about enough and it taught me a lot about the war with Japan and ww2 in general, the cast and production is unbelievable, the show makes you realize how brutal war is to everyone, I can't wait for masters of the air. For me this show is undoubtedly a masterpiece."
"It's taken me some time to write this. I really don't understand how people want to compare this to Band of Brothers.

For me it was one of the most visceral depictions of war in the Pacific. Beautifully shot, incredibly well acted, and painful at times. There are times when I thought I was I was there amongst all the mud, rain and blood. The battle at Peleliu was something i'll never forget.

This series is unforgettable."
"Every time I'm watching for a new season to start, I always come back to binge watching this. I love the explosions, drama, real life feel and reminds me of some of the stories my grandad would tell me as a child."
"Overall this show is not bad. Id even say it is good considering. But is it great, no. The main problem this show had was character development which many of these other reviews point out. But you must understand why. In Band of Brothers (BOB), most of the soldiers were alive during filming, and remembered so much that they were able to give detailed descriptions of themselves and their friends fallen in battle. This series didn't have that luxury. Only 3 men depicted were still alive during filming. That makes it very hard to portray individuals accurately with no one able to recall how they acted. So instead, understandably, they went in a different direction and focused on the war. Of the 10 episodes, 9 had major battle sequences. BOB had only 7 episodes with such battles. 6 if you take away episode 6 Bastogne as it focuses on Doc Rowe and his problems getting medical supplies and the hellish cold those men went through. Not to mention the entire first episode of BOB was all boot camp for that much needed character development. In The Pacific, the first time you see the soldiers together its as they are shipping out for battle. I wont go on and on like some, but basically if you go in not expecting to care for the characters and to enjoy the reenactments of the battles you will like it. But if your a true critic, it will be only good at best. And thats to bad. Of course rumors are already circling for a 3rd installment focusing on Africa. Wonder if that will happen."
"The Pacific does for the War in the Pacific theater. What Band of Brothers did for the European theater. It makes it more realistic. More understanding. and That's not an easy feat to do. As with Band of Brothers there is a large cast here . But the main focus is on only a few soldiers . Not surprising as the source matériel is taken Robert Leckie's Helmet for my Pillow and Eugene Sledge's In with the old Breed. Both books present a often shocking and brutal picture of the war. The Main focus is PFC Robert Leckie. PFC Eugene Sledge. And Gunny Sgt. Medal of honor Winner John Basilone. And the others caught in their orbit.

Leckie's story is simply the story of a every man caught up in forces he can't control. the Horror and mind breaking conditions he faces as the war progresses almost kills him several times and yet he persists.

Eugene sledge is the innocent young man 18 years old who wants to fight who wants to defend his country. And loses his innocence in the process. Sledge's story is the most emotional harrowing one here. Watching his story and the horrors he saw. Makes you wonder how he maintained his sanity. Sledge's friend Snafu is also a joy to watch as he helps Sledge maintain something of normality. In one scene when the new guys show up and snafu asks questions of them like their name sledge replies with a What Now you want to know their names . A common enough thing to happen during th war in which the seasoned vets did'not want to know the names of the new guys because they did not want to mourn them later on.

The LAst main focus is Sgt. John Basilone a Marine who wins the medal of honor winner who wins it on Guladcanel after holding off a force of three thousand Japanese soldiers for three days . That story is vividly brought to life as well as his struggles in being a hero doing a War bond drive. and eventually returning to duty on Iwo Jima .

The Pacific isn't perfect by any means . but in telling the story of the war. Its as good as it ever gets ."
"First off I am a massive fan of the first Band of Brothers. The character development it presented as the series went on really drew you in, as a result you cared about them which is what made the tension of the series.

Which leaves me wondering where BoB: Pacific has gone so wrong. Firstly, character development, there isn't any. You get a few token scenes of people saying goodbye to their families, and then bang you are on the beaches. As a result you don't know the characters, and so you don't care when they start dying. You have no idea of what these guys have gone through leading up the first assault, and you get no sense of their group dynamic. Its just a bunch of the most ragtag, barely military with seemingly no military training guys, acting like their hardcore vets off the set of Commando, where all it takes to defeat the Japanese is set up a machine gun post and the Japanese do the rest. As someone who is in the armed forces and studied the pacific war, the portrayal of the Japanese is ludicrous. They were some of the best jungle fighters in armed conflict, yet in BoB: Pacific, they are portrayed as cannon fodder. Yes, their fatalism is well documented, but it was always to a strategic end. Not in BoB: Pacific.

Overall, thoroughly disappointed so far. The original BoB was amazing, and stands as one of the best WW2 series ever made. This, is something I pretend doesn't exist lest it ruin my memories of the original BoB."
"At first I was hesitant to start watching this show. I am a survivor of rape and sexual assault, so I was afraid that this would be triggering for me. However it has actually been the opposite. Watching SVU has helped me heal and find closure with my past. I love that they are always actively combatting rape culture, and reminding that every one is worth a damn."
"As a huge fan and follower of this show for many, many years, I had rated it 10/10, and never missed an episode. But this new season ever since Kelli Giddish left the show, it seems the casting and writing has left the building as well.

I'm not saying that Giddish made or broke the show, but it seems with her leaving, the writers and casting directors left with her, because most of the new characters are just not believable, or offer up any reason to relate or sympathize with them, and the writing has become stale, ridiculous and mostly boring.

We see much less of the regulars like Tutuola, except for Benson, who seems to be on a power-trip all of the time all of a sudden, and Carisi, who seems lost since his love interest left her position. All the new cast seem to be entangled in too many nonsense personal dramas, and are just not convincing in their roles.

For the first time, I look more forward to seeing L&O-OC instead of L&O-SVU, as they've upped their writing and the show has become more suspenseful. Thus I've dropped my rating to a 8/10. Hopefully the writing improves with the upcoming episodes and the new characters as this season progresses."
"One of the better detective shows ever on television. The show is about a group of detectives who work in the Special Victims Unit and investigate sex related crimes. The SVU detectives are all dedicated and have their own stories and inner battles. Running for over 20 years is testament to the shows strength. It was far better during the first 10 - 12 years, as would be expected. The show has lost some steam, its edginess and changed direction somewhat over last several seasons. For the first 10 - 12 years of this show it was generally well balanced in its views. It focused closely on the detectives work and catching the criminal. For years now the detective work usually plays second fiddle to the show being self-righteous and making a political statement. But it is still worth watching now if you like detectives shows, just try to watch some episodes from the first 10 - 12 years.

The stories are usually well constructed and interesting. The theme most times is - a crime is committed, the detectives investigate and the case goes to court. The viewer gets taken through most steps of the crime, investigation and court case. The actual detective work portrayed is far from flawless, and often not the way real life detectives could or would work a case. There are often twists and turns in the story, some you see coming some you don't. The production, sets and acting is very good.

The best years of this show are the ones with the well balanced team of Christopher Meloni as Detective Elliot Stabler and Mariska Hargitay as Detective Olivia Benson. Stabler who is a force to be reckoned with but a bit of a loose cannon at times. With Benson as the deep thinker and more compassionate one. They were the stars of the show and a good team. They upheld the law and investigated the cases in a gritty and tough environment. There has always been a strong support cast and often a good guest star. The show has a cast members leaving and being replaced, which keeps the team dynamics fresh and interesting. With the absence of Detective Elliot Stabler during the latter years, the character of Detective Olivia Benson on-screen presence has grown noticeably. Its a shame as some of the other characters are well played and quite interesting, they should get more camera time without Olivia Bensons constant presence. Once a leading detective now Olivia Benson is the Captain of the unit, she is unlike the old captain who gave a few orders and some age old wisdom. Olivia Benson is very hands on and usually takes centre stage in virtually all of the stories with her brand of police work and leftist views on life. Mariska Hargitay became an executive producer of the show, which might explain the growth of the Olivia Benson character. The show has become more and more woke/left which affects the balance of the story telling. During the last several years of the show, its not too hard to guess who committed the crime, as more times than not, it is a nasty white guy, middle to upper class, 25 - 55 years old who is the perpetrator."
I love the SVU series. I'm watching every episode from the beginning. It helps me so much to think about something other than my cancer pain. So thank you for saving me from that!
"When I am communicating with other people interested in crime series it is remarkable how many people seem to watch either CSI or CSI: Miami or both. Rarely (actually never) have I heard talk about this show, unless I brought it up myself and ended up discussing it with them. Of course I do not know the situation in America and other countries regarding this show, but I feel it is very underrated in the Netherlands. Of course this has a lot to do with it's programming spot. While CSI is usually on Saturday's at 8:30 or 9:30 p.m. and CSI: Miami on Tuesdays at 8:30 p.m., SVU's spot has been Sunday's around 11p.m. for quite some time now. That's hardly what I call a prime time spot. Just to compare I looked up the share's of those 3 shows on the internet. CSI has a share of 26 in the US and 17,5 in the Netherlands. For CSI:Miami these numbers are 15,0 and 13,2 and for SVU they are 17,0 and 7,7. This doesn't mean much, but once bring the number of households into it, it gets a lot clearer. CSI has about 18,6 million viewers in the US while CSI:Miami and SVU have 10,5 and 11,9 viewers respectively. In the Netherlands these figures are 1,175 million; 910 thousand and 370 thousand. This means that SVU has less than one-third of the viewers CSI has and MUCH less than half the viewers CSI: Miami has. In America SVU has two-thirds of the viewers of CSI and about 10% more than CSI:Miami. In my opinion this has a lot to do with the extremely bad programming spot SVU has gained in the Netherlands and the fact that the program is not advertised as vigorously as the two CSI's, for I feel it cannot have anything to do with it's quality.

The thing that makes SVU stand out so much in opinion, is that the stories depicted are very realistic and heart felt. I personally appreciate it very much, that there are no cheap attempts to make you cry by extending dramatic scenes or underscoring them with sad music. Mostly the sad parts happen quite suddenly and are relatively short. Maybe that's just another 'trick' to get you to cry without being as obvious as many soap opera's. TO me though, it makes the stories appeal much more life-like and truly gut-wrenching and sad.

Also all of the characters are good. If you watch long enough, you can get bits and pieces of information on everyone of them, thus discovering what makes them tick. I must admit that the series has changes it's emphasis a bit in recent years. In the first year there were numerous episode's that featured theme's or events from the investigator's home environment (especially Stabler's). This trend has somewhat diminished over the years, yet you can still see each individual's background shining through into their work ethics. One thin I really had to get used to was Richard Belzer's (Det. John Munch) role getting smaller. It seems to me that in the first few years of the series he was present much more and he made much more cynical remarks, something I really enjoyed. But overall the series has not changed for the worse, for I feel it has actually improved. While a few years ago I'd given this series an 8 out of 10 I'm much more inclined now to rate it even higher. What I've come to appreciate these last 2 or three years, were the additions of Ice-T (Det. Fin Tutuola), B.D. Wong (Dr. George Huang) and Stephanie March (A.D.A. Alex Cabbot) to the team. Stephanie March's character provides the viewer not only with an insight to what the D.A's job is, but her involvement in the series also shows what difficult decisions need to be made at times when the victim becomes the pursued or when a suspect cannot legally be brought to justice. Huang's intense involvement lately is in my opinion the biggest and best evolution the series has undergone (up until now). Not only because there have been few if any series which placed the work of the forensic psychiatrist is in the spotlight, but also it is much more realistic than for instance the media's depiction of profilers in The Silence of the Lambs or the TV-series Profiler. Also I think it is good (in addition to being very interesting) to show the public that not every offender is purely bad, but there is often much more when you go beyond the surface. As for Ice-T's character, I think he really completes the mix in the show, as the tough street cop. Him and Belzer are an ideal couple, just like Benson (Mariska Hargitay) and Stabler (Christopher Meloni).

The reasons, I personally feel SVU is the best crime series on the tube at the moment, are easily summarized. It has very much diversity, it offers insight into the psyche's of both victim's and perpetrators and it is realistic in every aspect.

9 out of 10"
"Law & Order: Special Victims Unit is one of the best and most underrated shows on TV. It stars Christopher Meloni as Elliot Stabler, a tough-as-nails detective who makes his hatred of pedophiles and child molesters well known many times throughout the show. He has another side, a vicious side, that Criminal Intent's Robert Goren (Vincent D'Onofrio) lacks. I'm very pleased that he's been nominated for an Emmy. Mariska Hargitay won an Emmy for her performance as Olivia Benson, another fantastic detective. Benson has more edge than CI's Alex Eames (Kathrine Erbe), but is revered for her ability to communicate to troubled witnesses and gouge confessions out of suspects. Her life is put in danger at least twice a season, yet she continues to be strong. Next is the sarcastic detective Jon Munch, played by the excellent comedian Richard Belzer. Munch may seem annoying at times, but his ability to relate to witnesses is excellent, and he plays the ""good cop, bad cop"" role very well. The final detective is Finn Tutuola, played by former rapper Ice-T. Ice-T plays the character reasonably well, but I think we'd all like to see a meaner side of him. He was very good in the episodes entitled ""Rage,"" and ""Rooftop"". They are led by Don Cragen, played by Dann Florek, and Cragen is as good a captain as any, as Florek reprises his role he held on ""Law & Order"" for a few years. Adam Beach recently joined the show, bringing something new to the table in youth and his almost 'surfer dude' approach to detective work. The ADA now is Casey Novak, played by Diane Neal, who could be better, but she gets the job done. She's been better of late, and the contrast between her and her predecessor is really helpful to the show. Her predecessor, Alexandra Cabot (Stephanie March) was great also. The team is also aided by an FBI psychiatrist, George Huang (BD Wong), who aids them in finding out the true horrors of a person, witness or suspect. His best performance was in the episode called ""Coerced."" The members of this unit investigate sexually based crimes (rape, rape-homicide) and child based crimes (school shootings, child abuse, child molestation). The show has had extraordinary guest stars, from evil (Johnny Messner, Reg Flowers, Asio Highsmith, Jeff Kober) to touching (Leland Orser, Jerry Lewis) to lost (Brittany Snow) to famous and legendary actors (Jerry Lewis, Dean Cain, Chris ""Ludacris"" Bridges, Henry Winkler, Robin Williams, Matthew Modine, Alfred Molina, Cynthia Nixon, John Ritter). This is a truly great show that not only shows the line of work in this graphic department, but shows the emotional stress a detective goes through. 10/10"
"I am not usually into law all that much but this show is an exception. Each actor does an excellent job portraying their character and the show keeps me on the edge of my seat in every episode I watch.

Also, they do a excellent job at making the least suspected character that many don't think did the crime, the one who actually did do the crime.

They also do a good job at making the storyline for each episode. Instead of keeping the same old ones in every episode, they mix the story lines between rape, poison, kidnap, beating, child abuse etc. You just never know what the show is about until you watch it and that is what makes it so great.

Overall, I give this excellent show a 10/10."
"I've always thought that Special Victims Unit was qualitatively inferior to the original Law And Order. Not that the cast was bad and certain individual episodes were outstanding. But overall the concept of focusing on sex crimes led our detectives way far field into areas that certainly were not in their jurisdiction. In real life Benson, Staebler, Tutuola, and Munch should have handed off cases to other squads and investigative units and even other police agencies.

Still Christopher Meloni and Mariska Hargitay made a most professional team and their biggest contribution to the show's staying power was demonstrating that two people could have a most professional relationship without becoming romantically involved. When Meloni started having marital issues they were not over Mariska.

It took awhile, but Richard Belzer who retired from the Baltimore PD and went right to work for the Sex Crime Unit at the NYPD finally came up with a chemically compatible partner in Ice-T. In fact all four of the detectives register with unique personalities and a take on life.

The producers of Law And Order owed Dann Florek big time for dropping him from the prime series so it was nice to see him back in charge of this squad. A nice connection to the original series.

This show's gets far more way out in its stories, but they are delivered with pride and professionalism as befits the cast. Only the most especially heinous of crimes are dealt with here."
This was an amazing show when it had a bigger ensemble cast. Now its less than a handful of regulars?!?!!! Just not as good as it used to be.
"I used to love this show, but now it's all about Benson. She leads the charge, delivers all the crushing lines, saves the day, swans around as is SVU was her baby, and we get her flamin personal life thrown in to boot.

I am irritated now by her. Her twee soft voice when trying to appear caring, her cocking her head to the left when trying to appear sympathetic.

Mariska can't act. She has for some reason risen up through the ranks of this once brilliant show and now in her leading lady role, as well as producer and director has turned it into a one trick, three legged donkey."
"I used to LOVE this show. Like many, I was sad when Stabler left and kept hoping he'd return but, hey, at least we still had Munch, Cragen and Fin. The show should've ended when Munch and Cragen left. Since then, it seems the sole purpose of this show is to surpass the record set by the FAR SUPERIOR original ""Law & Order"" which NEVER should've ended (or, at least been given the proper send-off it deserved). The last several years of SVU have been completely unwatchable. Not because of the so-called ""leftist propoganda"" some viewers have accused but because the writing, acting, and overall feel and tone of the show has descended to the immeasurably low quality formerly found only in embarrassingly inferior ""Law & Order"" wannabe franchises (CSI, NCIS, Criminal Minds, et al).

This show doesn't deserve to have the record for longevity when the quality has been sorely lacking for at least the last 1/3 of its run. Just END it already!"
I watched SVU a lot before but now it's just soap all the way. Just sad to watch really.
I have never one been that big of a fan of the original Law & Order. I would watch it for time to time and it was an alright show but never really had anything jump out at me to make it one of my can't miss shows. Then this show came on. I watched this show when it premiered back in 1999 and was impressed from the get go. Sure it followed the basic premise of it's original cousin but was much more loose on it's format and execution. Some episodes hardly ever involve the court room at all where the original week in week out follows a distinct pattern. First half hour is the law then the next is the order. This show although does sometimes follow the same pattern like i mentioned it is much more loose in how it executes it. Mariska Hartigay is excellent as her portrayal of Det. Olivia Benson. The whole cast as a whole is magnificent. Now I know a lot of people will disagree with me that this show is in no way better than the original but for me it is. It has given me something that the original never did.
"Must watch tv till season 22 , then tick in the box woke nonsense took over , every episode now has a race angle or some left wing soap box preaching in it , let's drop the PC nonsense and get back to how it was !"
"I still do not like the character of Olivia Benson being in charge of SVU as she is not good at it at all as she strictly is all for the females every time as far as victims go but then she doesn't trust or get totally along with Rollins maybe she sees her as a threat or something because Rollins sees & hears both sides males & females. They need to bring in somebody else to be in charge of SVU & bust Benson back down to just being a detective. The last & latest episode I'm on the fence or almost over the fence because the ""victim"" liked the guy when she first seen him telling her cousin he is hot & then the whole bathroom scene & other witnesses from the party said she was all over him even as they went outside. I do not think it warrants rape. Also in this episode Benson makes it sound like before we have sex every time we have to ask permission & wait for a firm definitive yes or no whether it's our wife or girlfriend or whomever & that way off point & wrong. Rape is or should be when somebody says no or is fighting you off while at the same time the perp doesn't care what the female is saying & forces it on her anyway."
"A spin-off of the 'Law and Order' series, 'Law & Order: Special Victims Unit' has to be one of the best police shows on television in a long time. While I do enjoy the original 'Law and Order' series, it has to take a distant second place to SVU with it's gritty, involving scripts, well-depicted characters and excellent performances from all the cast. It is never afraid to portray the darker side of humanity and what depths people can go to in hurting another.

The characters give the audiences different means of venting their disgust and shock of the abuse cases the SVU team deal with. From Christopher Meloni's Elliot Stabler, who openly displays the utter hatred of paedophiles that we all identify with (and I hope there are many officers like Stabler in the police forces across the world), to Mariska Hargitay's Olivia Benson, who shows deep caring for the child and abuse victims she comes into contact with. The rest of the cast are also brilliant and give you a feel that these are characters who care for each other and the people they protect.

With the amount of rubbish that is aired on British television at the moment, SVU reminds me why I bother to keeping buying a TV license."
This used to be my favorite show. But recently the show has gone down hill. All the mrs Stabler. I think I will stick to law and order. Great show. No soapy crap.
"Okay i started watching this show not when it premiered because that was 9 years ago and i was 10 back then, and not allowed to watch shows like that back then lol. But as soon as i started to watch this show i knew it was the show for me, this show honestly has EVERYTHING. acting top notch, directing, producing, story line, suspension, everyhting that a show should have :). In addition to all those factors this show is completely educating. I am a psychology major and half of the material we learn i learn watching this show. Every time i answer all questions in my class without reading the material. I think that children these days are much more mature than they used to be and if they watch this show starting at age 13-14 instead of watching other shows that they should not be, they would be much more educated in this world of ours. Aagin this show is an amazing show, these writers sure know what they are doing. Other shows should take a great big example from this show:) Thank you"
"Other than the original ""Law & Order"" police-drama created by Dick Wolf, spin-off series ""Law & Order: Special Victims Unit"" is the best. This series focuses on the SVU, a section of the New York Police Department that specializes in sexually-based offenses. Here, on the ""Law"" side, we're introduced to ultra-cool cop duo Olivia Benson (Mariska Hargitay) and Elliot Stabler (Christopher Meloni), supported by John Munch (Richard Belzer) and Fin Tutuola (Ice-T) and watched over by Cpt. Donald Cragen (Dann Florek). Other supporting characters include M.E. Warner (Tamara Tunie) and Dr. Huang (B.D. Wong). On the ""Order"" side, we have ADA Casey Novak (Diane Neal, who replaced ADA Alexandra Cabot, who was played by Stephanie March for five seasons). I think this is the highest-rated spin-off because it's the most accessible. We have characters we really like, and we're continuously showed their lives on and off the job, and I think that's what draws us in each week for more. I still occasionally read stories about how some of the actors on ""SVU"" are approached on the street by fans of the show and are told how much they mean to them. That's a mark of truly great television, don't you think?

10/10"
"I used to love this show, and still enjoy most of the earlier episodes. I've become tired of the political themes though. I watch to see a crime show, not have agendas shoved down my throat. I'm not even conservative and I find it annoying. After seeing the previews for next week's episode, I probably won't watch it. If all the episodes this season are like this, I'll likely just stop watching altogether."
One of my favorites I could watch this everyday ...the cast is amazing it's just such a great show since the beginning I've been watching never missed an episode
"SVU used to be one of my favourite shows. There's been some incredible, edge-of-your-seat episodes like ""911"", but now it's mostly he-said she-said's and statutory rapes between two willing participants (i.e. 15 year old girl and 16 year old guy). Yes, it's more realistic and true to life, but that's not why I watch TV like this. If I wanted realistic crime shows I'd watch Highway Cops or something - not Law & Order.

The political agenda pushing that's become central to the show is beyond aggravating. As the most liberal, feminist, pro-immigration, anti-racist, anti-fascist person around, having the views I already believe in forced down my throat every time I'm trying to chill out and watch TV is frustrating. It's also even more frustrating knowing how pointless it is - SVU is a crime show, it's not going to make anyone reconsider their politics, and it's dumb to isolate people from a show they've enjoyed for decades just because their politics differ to yours. The way it's all approached feels really patronising and tacky too - and the ""my way is the right way"" attitude is unhelpful in creating any positive political discussion.

Season 19 has been better than the past few seasons - there's been a few more engaging plot lines. It's still not even close to how it used to be though, where virtually every episode was an 8/10 with 9's being a common occurrence. Now it's more like every episode is a 5/10, and we're lucky if we get a 7.

I don't watch the show regularly anymore; I just resort to it when there's literally nothing else I can think of to watch. It sucks because it was so good, and I don't even think the new cast is too bad (yeah, they're not the OG's, but I can deal with it if the plots are good). It seemed to get a lot worse when Mariska Hargitay took over as Executive Producer.

Bring back engaging plots please and stop the political tripe. :("
"I just finished Black Mirror and the first word that comes to mind is...wow! I've never seen anything like it. The stories are all shocking, disturbing and thought provoking. Most of them are about how technology is changing, has changed us, and not always for the better. It's almost like a satire of how media obsessed we have gotten. Each episode really makes you think afterwards and will make you want to talk about what happened. Every episode is like a mini movie, there're stand alone episodes and every episode has an incredible cast filled with A-list actors. While everyone will have their own favorite episodes, every single one of them will make you think and there's not a ""bad"" episode in the entire series."
"You're reviewing the whole show here,not individual seasons or episodes. Don't give a low rating just because you didn't like Miley or the 5th series. Keep everything in context and just rate on your overall impression of Black Mirror. Carry on."
"I've been a longtime fan of Black Mirror. It had always felt like a modern Twilight Zone with a focus on the potential downsides of future technologies. With season 6 it feels like they threw the premise out the window and went with an anything goes approach to storytelling, including the supernatural. In addition, the overall quality of the writing has declined in seasons 5 and 6. The first 4 seasons of the show is among my favorite TV shows ever, but they seem to have mostly lost their touch.

It's not that the most recent seasons are irredeemable because there are some pretty good episodes, but they are nowhere near the high bar that was set by the early seasons. Don't believe me? Go watch from the beginning and it will become obvious how much the show has changed. None of the newer episodes are remotely close to the quality of ""The Entire History of You"", ""White Bear"", and ""White Christmas."" Even the weaker episodes of seasons 1-4 are significantly better than most of seasons 5 and 6.

I suppose it's nice to get some new episodes of Black Mirror even if it isn't what it used to be, but I was hoping for much better. Despite my misgivings about the last two seasons, I hope there ends up being a season 7 because I am a big fan of the anthology series format. Overall, I still think the show deserves a solid 8 when considering the entirety of the series to this point."
"This is purely for seasons 1-4 and for Bandersnatch from season 5.

Season 5 was boring and silly. Season 6 is a mixture of terrible episodes and some quite well done episodes that have nothing whatsoever to do with Black Mirror.

Seasons 1 through 4 are masterpieces. Some episodes are better than others, like with any Anthology series. But the good ones are just next-level, even when you have to suspend disbelief sometimes (full nervous system VR systems the size of an M&M - no, not unless everything else is up to the same level of tech!).

It seems that once a series peaks, we just have to accept that that's it, it's done, it will never get up there again. For me the high water marks were CROCODILE, METALHEAD and WHITE BEAR. Though I have to say, I still got back and watch the speech from 15 MILLION MERITS for the thrill of it. It's too good.

4 seasons, 1 special - that's pretty good. Now we need something of equal calibre!

""Somebody"" removes negative reviews so I hope this one will just sail through."
"Black Mirror is one of the most original and best Mini-Series ever created. Each episode tells a different story about the modern world we live in and the technology we all love and while not all, most of them are fascinating. They are all filled with a-list stars and made by great directors. Each stand alone episode is thought provoking and filled with enough drama and suspense to keep you at the edge of your seat. While there are a few episodes that are not as good when compared to the others, most of them are fantastic. This show gets compared to The Twilight Zone a lot and while it's a pretty good comparison, I think Black Mirror is actually a lot better. It's hard to explain how incredible this show is so just go watch it."
"Amazing British anthology series with a very intriguing concept. The premise: taking contemporary phenomena (ranging from the wild popularity of talent shows on TV to the impact of social media and smartphones on our lives) as a starting point and speculate how such phenomena could/would evolve in the future. Each episode tells a different story with different protagonists and focuses on a different theme. Of course, the series doesn't explore the beneficial aspects or any positive trends - (where would the fun be in that?) - but clearly approaches its topics from a pessimistic, cynical point of view (hence the title). As the show's creator Charlie Brooker ('Dead Set') puts it: ""...They (the different stories) are all about the way we live now – and the way we might be living in 10 minutes' time if we're clumsy.""

The resulting mix of bleak sci-fi, drama, satire and black comedy makes for highly intelligent Television and ranks among the most original and entertaining shows I've ever come across. The writing and directing are excellent and the cast includes such talented thesps as Domhnall Gleeson, Rory Kinnear, Toby Kebbell, Hayley Atwell, Jon Hamm, Jason Flemyng and Rupert Everett - to name but a few. Unique, fascinating and highly recommended. 9 stars out of 10.

"Brilliant.

Absolutely brilliant.

This is NOT anti-utopian, it is an actual mirror of a utopian idea gone terribly wrong.

I've only watched 3 episodes so far and each one has made me think, made me go back and look again, made me ask myself why this had never occurred to me before.

I would call this sci-fi in the richest sense of the genre.... it is not about science, but how science affects human beings. The one thing that never seems to change is us. Technology evolves, mutates, advances and declines, but human beings, our feelings, our courage, fears, and desires remain within us.

I love this show. I hope you will love it too. And I hope you will think."
"The double entendre that is Black Mirror's name summarizes the show perfectly. The first interpretation is that the show looks inwards, at the darker aspects of humanity and society. This is done through the theme of technology, hence the second meaning. The black mirror is the screen that rules our lives.

Each self-contained episode is brilliantly crafted and produced. The stories are compelling and the acting is phenomenal. This show is not for those looking exclusively for entertainment, as the episodes leave you with a distinctly empty feeling. Although this is obviously the intent, one cannot help but wonder at the creators' bleak outlook on the world. The presence of bestiality in the first episode could very well deter some viewers, but I would remind them that the show is Twilight Zone-esque in structure as well as theme. The episodes may be watched in any order, as they are all completely independent of one another. The second episode in particular is storytelling of the highest form.

Black Mirror is disturbing in the best possible way. It unflinchingly explores the issues of society through deeply intimate stories and characters and their interactions with technology. Let me be clear, it will not leave you feeling fulfilled. Watching it was an exhausting experience that shook me deeply. The thought provoking subject matter combine with powerful, desolate stories and excellent performances to create one of the most unique and brilliant shows that I have seen. It not only holds the viewer's attention while it plays, it enthralls your thoughts long after the credits roll."
"I have only seen the first two installments of this series and but was impressed enough to leave a review. Charlie Brooker has popped out of the internet at times when I least expect it revealing the more unsettling aspects of our culture through his program Screenwipe and others. That was my first exposure to Doug Stanhope, a comedian who among others brings us closer together via demonstrations of how media and technology are changing our society and rarely for the better. Black Mirror arrives in the form of anthologized science fiction in the vein of the Twilight zone. It is a series that examines our society's relationship with the media and how it allows us to both shape our own identity and imprison us in a space where empathy and truth are weaknesses and something to hide in order to get ahead.

I have always been interested in futurists and Brooker seems to fill the requirements for one. There is nothing in the first two installments that do not reflect current trends in our collective behavior but instead extrapolates where current trends in communications technology; avatars, social media and reality television might lead us if we do not seek to preserve what is beautiful and pure about our collective consciousness and humanity.

Having seen reviews here that feel there is no commentary embedded within these stories I couldn't disagree more. As the title suggests, Brooker's Black Mirror shows us a dark reflection of our selves and allows us to evaluate these scenarios through our own emotional filters.

There are no blatant soap box messages but I interpreted the narratives as cautionary tales and would hope that no one, when confronted with them, would hope for these near futures. The only thing holding them back from becoming reality is our own resistance to complacency and purely spectator culture.

Beyond these philosophical aspects, the program is incredibly well produced and executed in my opinion. The characters and sets create convincing realities and I was never once drawn out of the story due to poor acting, scripting or characterizations. I could not recommend this series more and hope that it will continue on. Congratulations to Brooker and company for their work and their apparent concern for all of us."
This is the biggest surprise i came across these last couple of years. This series is one of the best i've seen. Every episode is unique yet criticizes the same absurd society we're living in. I was shocked at the great filming/acting/directing and of course writing of these different stories. My personal favorite would be episode 2. The most futuristic but also the most accurate representation of what most of our lives look like right now. Just saw in a review that a guy stopped watching after 20 minutes at the second episode. That's the biggest mistake he could do. Definitely the best episode. I wont miss anything else Charlie Brooker does and i'm patiently waiting for the DVD to come out. I hope this also gets a Blu-Ray version and maybe some new episodes after wards?
"...season five was bad (episode 1), mildly acceptable (episode 2) and are you kidding me? (episode 3). Miley Cyrus? This series started out as an inventive, original and disturbing show. When it became ""Americanized"", it went downhill fast. Please, either return to the original premise, or don't put out more trash."
-1 because of that Season 5 that I wished I never knew existed.
"Latest series is on the rails, by the book, it almost feels like series 6 has been written by AI.

Hold on. Is that going to be the final twist - that Charlie Brooker got ChatGPT to write series 6? That would explain the lack of plot twists and the by-the-numbers predictability.

If Charlie Brooker is playing 4D chess and has willingly created a poor series 6 to make a brilliantly executed point to the suited streamer overlords that AI cannot create as well as humans, then hats off to him. I'll revise this review to an 11/10.

But if that's not the case, then what did happen between series 5 and 6?"
If you watch this whole series...you can see the reality of it...and it's horrifying. I believe that this series really makes you think about how easily and fast things can get out of control. It was an awesome show!
"I found myself irritated with one of the reviewers who gave this mini-series a terrible review because it left him feeling ""disturbed"". Ermm.... I think that's the intention....

As many others have pointed out, the series is superbly put together: the actors are great; the script, if anything, is minimalist and the production excellent.

This isn't reality TV. This picks out the darkest aspects of how are future in this this modern age could end up, in extremis....

Personally, I think it's a Facebook/Twitter/Flickr/Android/iPhone/Tab/internet horror story and whilst I think it's probably too brutal for most people, it is a reflection of how we give up and of ourselves to the digital, overwhelmingly public way that the world now wants us to be.

I love the show. Will it change my FB or other behavior? No but, truth be told, I might be watching out of the corner of my eye...."
"Watching it was disturbing and shocking at the same time.

Depressive in a way, but also genius and defying! The way it makes you question and think about reality and our modern technological ages it's brilliant!

And although being fictional and mostly sci-fi, it's so realistic in the scariest way!

It's not about tech... it's about us and our ""human nature"", the good and the bad, our best and worst as humans and that is definitely the most disturbing aspect of it all.

Worth seeing it all with detailed attention cause it's probably one of the most intelligent and critical TV series done recently!!

Thank you Mr Brooker and all the team!

P.S.: the first two episodes are probably the most disturbing ones and it's curious that all the bad reviews focus only in the first one... Reading those bad reviews only make more sense to the all series idea... Shocking uh? But wouldn't we be all in the pub watching it?"
"To sum up this series for me is quite easy, It's a dark look at what could be, and a very deep look at the worst of human nature.

The cast and set are different every time, but one theme I found recurring was that each episode was extremely haunting, and it definitely gets the viewer thinking about what could be if the world was just a little bit different. I don't think Black Mirror will appeal to everyone because some themes are a slightly uncomfortable especially in the pilot episode. So far the actors that have been cast have done an amazing job, and the writers have managed to make some far fetched ideas seem graspable. Basically this series is unlike anything else on TV and for that it gets a big thumbs up from me.

I don't want to write any spoilers, but what I will say is this if you want a drama with dark twist or a series that is completely Original make it Black Mirror."
"In the new golden age of tv shows, this one is on another level. That's saying something, considering the expectation we have now. Black Mirror is an anthology series that, if you follow dope stuff, has achieved that rare-air status that if there's another season you feel blessed. It's that good imo. Absolutely a 21st Century version of The Twilight Zone. And it keeps coming back, but on nobody's timeline. And A list stars just flock to it?! I don't really love each and every episode. But there are so many episodes of this program that really leave ya shaken. Because us doesn't seem that far removed from a plausible scenario. Check it out. It'll make ya wonder......"
"When I talk about this show I always tell people to ""Just skip the first episode and watch it at the end."" Other than that it's a mind blowing, ground breaking, and terrifying series. It shows exactly where humankind is currently heading and has already reached in some instances. A mirror can only show a reflection of what's already there so Black Mirror is an apt title.

I've watched all the episodes multiple times and wish like crazy they had continued the show. It was one of the truly rare shows willing to take an unflinching look at humanity and how screwed up it is, and how much worse it's getting. In my experience, those who don't like the show seem to prefer living with their head in the sand while humming loudly to drown out the noise. Ignorance doesn't change the world, seeing it for what it is and then choosing to be better is what can do it."
"Black Mirror is a British science fiction anthology television series created by Charlie Brooker. Each episode of the series presents a standalone story that explores the darker aspects of modern society, particularly the unanticipated consequences of the use of technology in our daily lives. The show explores various themes such as the impact of technology on society, privacy, surveillance, and human nature.

The series is known for its dark and disturbing tone, and its ability to take a thought-provoking look at the ways in which technology is shaping our world. The show's episodes are diverse in terms of genre, tone, and style, with some episodes being more comedic and others being more dramatic and suspenseful.

The acting in the series is also noteworthy, with a talented ensemble cast that delivers strong performances in each episode. The writing is also exceptional, with well-crafted and thought-provoking storylines that keep the audience engaged and thinking long after the episode has ended.

One of the criticisms that could be made about the series is that some episodes are stronger than others, and some may not resonate with all audiences. Additionally, the series can be quite dark and disturbing, which may not be suitable for all viewers.

Overall, I would recommend Black Mirror for fans of science fiction, anthology series, and those looking for a thought-provoking and thought-provoking series that explores the darker aspects of modern society and the impact of technology on our lives. The show's diverse episodes, talented ensemble cast, and well-crafted storylines make it a must-watch series. It's a unique and captivating series that keeps the audience thinking long after the episode has ended."
"Black Mirror has always been one of my favourite shows. It is completely different from everything else. It has been fresh, quirky and gripping in every respect. Every episode has been different and has transfixed me. It is now described as a Netflix original. It was on U. K TV years before it got to Netflix.

I have been anxiously awaiting the release of season 6 which I've just binge watched over a couple of days.

I was quite disappointed in Season 6 with some episodes having a familiar ring to them where I've seen very similar themes before, even in previous episodes.

The best episode of season 6 from my perspective was episode 2 Loch Henry which was scary, original and brilliantly acted. Overall I found season 6 patchy and disappointing."
"I COULDNT tell i was watching black mirror through the whole 6th season. All the time I was waiting for that mind-f black mirror moment and plot where i really pause to process but I didn't get any.

On joan is awful Salma presence felt like she was shooting a commercial rather than filming TV and wro wasn't strong.. such a waste for the amount of talented actors and actresses in 1 episode.

On the Loch henry, it really felt just like watching a documentary, any random documentary only showing you behind the scenes except for the ending.

Mazey Day, was a Don't Look Up wannabe TV which is very mediocre.

I don't know what's happening to the show but bring us Black museum, white Christmas, Nosedive, White bear, Playtest creators...

chatGBT, TikTok, Crypto, Podcasts...all of these addictive concepts and you went with a documentary..."
"Black Mirror is an anthology, meaning it is complied of different sci fi tales to make their seasons. This means the series doesn't really have any synopsis I can say, the only thing I can say is just watch the bloody show already. Every episode is different, some horror, some romance, some drama, and if you don't like the episode then just skip it, it's not like you'll miss anything as the next episode on your binge watch will be the complete opposite of what you just watched. As far as acting goes, it's top notch, stars like Jon Hamm, Daniel Kaluuya also appear on episodes bringing their amazing performances to the table. Every episode has their own cinematography, some bright and colorful, one episode will be black and white, really adding in on the unique feel of the whole thing. I would definitely call this show a masterpiece, but i almost gave it a 9 because of the 5th series. 2 episodes from the fifth series were pretty sh*te. Smithereens was great, so was Andrew Scott's performance. So yes, a masterpiece still, I won't let 2 bad episodes change that especially when compared to the works of art that the previous series had to offer. So ignore season 5 apart from Smithereens, Smithereens had a very important message and was a wonderfully shot and acted tale. Think of it as a mix of mini films. Now there may be some things that you may not find good, but there's always an episode for you. There 's twists, laughs, scares all in hour long episodes and tied up in a neat little bow just for you. And the Christmas Special was stunning, don't forget to watch that. But if that isn't enough, they have their own interactive film, Bandersnatch. An. Interactive. Film. You choose what the main character does, and it is awesome. So please, If you have the time, try watching this, you will not be disappointed. Verdict: With something new every episode, Black mirror really gets to you, and in all the right ways. A+"
"American Dad! Is one of the best animated shows of all-time. It's created by Seth MacFarlane (Family Guy, Ted, The Orville) so you know it's hilarious. Everything MacFarlane touches turns to gold. He just hits home run after home run. What makes this show stick out more than others is that every character on the show is equally funny. They all have their moments that'll make you laugh out loud. I'd have to say that American Dad! Is easily one of the most under appreciated animated shows ever. It's prob on my Top 5. It's been on since 2005 so it's changed with the times and still been just as funny as the early seasons."
"American Dad is another classic created by Seth McFarlane. It has remained the same hilarious show for 17 seasons now and is just as funny now as when it first started. While it's not as good as McFarlane's other classic animated show Family Guy, it's still one of the better animated shows aimed at adults that I've ever seen. It's amazing to me that it has been able to stay as funny as it has over that many seasons and doesn't look like it's slowing down anytime soon. It went on hiatus for a while and then TBS made the incredibly smart decision to bring it back because it's now one of their best shows."
"Cute and funny animated series about an ideologically divided family with different species that deal with unusual problems in a funny and weird way, really cute."
"They are currently in season 14 and this show somehow still makes me laugh out loud more than almost any other show on TV.

I took a break from the show a couple of years ago, as around season 11 it seemed to be showing signs of wear, but wow did they course-correct.

Seasons 13 and 14 are among some of the best ever, and the writing is outstanding. They are still packing every episode with an insane amount of jokes, even on the level of <10 Simpsons. Also, this show somehow manages to tackle very common and complex human behavior in the most outlandish ways.

The fact that this show has been hilarious for 14 straight years is a feat I don't think any other show outside of South Park has achieved.

I really hope time helps more people find this absolute gem of a show."
"I love this show. It's such a relief to see a show like ""American Dad,"" especially on Fox. It can't be helped that some people are too unconscious to understand the desperately needed, hilarious criticism that it offers. It's ""Sullivan's Travels"" meets ""Dr. Strangelove,"" rolled up into an animated series. Yeah, it's probably too smart for the masses, but we have to start somewhere. If it's marketed like ""The Family Guy,"" during DVD release, then hopefully it will later be recognized for its absolute brilliance. Speaking of brilliance, airing the first episode immediately after the Super Bowl was unquestionably the most impeccably timed programming in the history of television. Did I mention that I love this show? That I need this show for sustenance?"
Short and sweet I love the show and def better than Family Guy in my opinion. Sometimes hit or miss but the addition of new characters are great!! Rogu!!
"I've never done a review, but I think I should just drop one in here for my favorite show ever. I've watched endless amount of shows, movies, and most people's all time favorites. NOTHING beats American Dad. Also, Family Guy is great, but American Dad is a different world! It has everything you can imagine and enjoy and the amount of happiness I get from it is just unexplainable. You could describe it in a million ways and it's still not enough. Always being surprised by what comes next and what Roger is up to. Can't wait for season 15!"
American dad always makes me laugh when I watch it. I think Roger Smith is the funniest character so he is my favorite. I think the artwork is good. I think a lot of the plots for the show are creative. I would have never thought of written them I know that. American dad is one of the funniest animated shows I have seen. No Its the funniest animated television series I have seen. I enjoy watching American Dad because it makes me laugh. What a terrific show
"I love American Dad, because it has a healthy mixture of pop culture, and pure comedy so that if you are a lot younger and you aren't as familiar with pop culture, you'd enjoy it. This is unlike Family Guy where Seth Macfarlane mainly focuses on pop culture for laughs."
"Are they trying to ruin this shwo on purpose? It started out clever, funny and so different from other shows. Now you can almost feel the writers coming up with the most random stories and jokes possible. It's not clever anymore, it tries to be obnoxious. American Dad used to have original storylines, that were funny and memorable. The latest episodes however are just...well...stupid. It's like the characters are yelling: ""Are you laughing yet? No? Okay, we'll turn it up a notch"". Here's an American Dad episode I just made up from scratch: Stan realizes that Francine's grandmother was hot, so he clones her and keeps saying how hot she is. Francine becomes so mad, that she fights her own grandmother in a pool of goo, where the clones are artificially grown. In the B-Story Roger and Steve go to candy factory, like in the Willy Wonka movie, where chimpanzees are held as slaves. When they try to free them, the monkeys kill all the workers and their favorite chimp tragigly sacrifises itself. The episodes ends with Francine winning and kicking Stan in the balls as he lies there in pain for like 2 minutes. See? That's how much thought is in the newer episodes. This show was a 8 or 9 out of ten for me. Not it's barely about average"
"On first glance, American Dad looks like a carbon copy of Seth MacFarlane's ""other"" show Family Guy. The animation is near identical, the lead character Stan Smith's knuckle headed optimism and in-your-face presentation doesn't so much recall Peter Griffin as grab you by the throat and scream in your face and Roger the alien and Klaus the goldfish work in much the same way Stewie and Brian do in the previous show. So far so very familiar, as though MacFarlane dressed up his fourth FG series with different characters when it was initially cancelled so as to stay on the air but stick with it, and American Dad will eventually reveal itself as a superior cartoon to it's predecessor.

Sure, the humour is once again a mixture of insightful witticisms, biting satire and odd bursts into toilet humour but rather than the chaos of Family Guy where the plot seems to revolve round the jokes, here the opposite is true. The flashbacks are almost totally absent and instead each episode features a structure and character development that is normally missing from the first show. Okay some of the episodes fall a bit flat but nevertheless, there are considerably more hits than there are misses and when it's good, it's brilliant. ""A Smith In The Hand"" for example is in this writer's humble opinion, the funniest thing MacFarlane and his team have ever produced.

What's more, American Dad is considerably more politically-orientated and everything you could conceive about the USA's current state of fear mongering and distrust is put beneath a microscope and parodied mercilessly. Stan Smith is a boorish depiction of all that paranoia rolled into one and some of his outbursts and overreactions are hilarious. Take the scene where he locks up his new Arab neighbours in his back garden for instance in a moment that scarily recalls the nightmarish conditions of Guantanamo bay yet still manages to be side splittingly funny or any of his numerous conceited one-liners (""only women have emotions son, they come from their ovaries"").

Only time will tell if American Dad can outlive the shadow of it's far more successful big brother, but like the relationship between Futurama and the Simpsons beforehand, it's often a far funnier and considerably more focused show that deserves a wider audience. Highly recommended."
This cartoon series is more coherent than Family Guy which is both good and bad. The good thing is that there is more consistency and we can take time to invest in these characters and scenarios. The bad thing is that it doesn't have as much dynamic randomness which is what fuelled Family Guy's humour.
"I missed the pilot episode after the Superbowl, so my first encounter with this show was in a five minute promo that aired before Fever Pitch in theaters a few months ago. And the thing was, I thought it was great. Everything was hilarious, and it ended on just the right note.

And then I started to watch the show.

My heading says that I'm sick of trying to convince myself I like this. I emphasize that, because it wasn't an instant dislike. It took a while to realize that American Dad! isn't as funny as Family Guy.

Or King of the Hill.

Or Price is Right reruns from the 1970s.

Or public access.

I've heard a lot about how Family Guy, Seth McFarlane's cult TV favorite may or may not be a ripoff of The Simpsons, and I never felt it was. But I can't shake the feeling that American Dad! was an attempted modification of the Family Guy theme - not a ripoff, just a modification - and it just doesn't work for me.

The characters in this show each have one gimmick (attractive mom/CIA right-wing nut case/German fish/alien/nerd/hippie) , which is why I found them so endearing in the five minute promo. Five minutes was about how long their gimmicks were funny. And I'm sick of trying to convince myself I like this show.

I'm not bitter or anything. I'm just not going to watch this anymore. I'll stick to My Kind of Town, the ABC game show that airs in the same time slot and is destined for cancellation at the end of the season, I just know it. I'm not sure how much longer American Dad! will run... but I hope that an extended time frame improves quality."
Hilarious...Certainly funnier than family guy!!The humour is authentic and pure...as though it came to the writers naturally.
"HIGHLY underrated show. Top 3 funniest animated shows out there, if not, #1 for comedy in an animated series."
"I was expecting this to just be a family guy clone with different character, This is more than that, its hilarious. The characters and humor are on the same sort of level as family guy but Seth McFarlane managed to work his magic and create a whole new different level of humor and wit for this show which sets itself apart from family guy.

A secret service FBI agent, prone to overreacting must find a way to use his skills to help his family and their new illegal alien housemate with basic troubles in life. Problem is sometimes it proves too much with hilarious results.

Remember this isn't a kid's show and I guess thats what makes this and family guy so special. They can put in all the added toilet humor it needs and the writers seem to know how to do it perfectly. The characters are great but the main character Stan Smith stands out above all the rest (With their alien friend coming in a close second). Anyone who wants a laugh, drop everything and watch this."
At least here there is some attempt at a narrative. I found this show funny with an actual story to look forward to. The characters are cute and grow on you. Definitely worth a binge.
"At first glance this show may look like a dodgy Family Guy copy but with different characters but it is far from that. American Dad focuses more on political humor and jokes that never fall flat. In a way it is Seth McFarlanes' Futurama. By this I mean its a show made by him that looks like his other show but has a completely different vibe. Fans of Family Guy constantly hate on this show because it has a different style of humour and tone. It still has curses, crude humor, violence and sexual references like Family Guy but focuses on making fun of political situations and current events. I say definitely check out American Dad if you want a nice satisfying half an hour of comedy. It is well worth watching."
Sorry but it's been done before. It's still a funny watch but no innovation happening here when you compare it to family guy
Definitely not original in amongst other comedy cartoons but it's hilarious! I'm so glad this series has continued to run into this year.
"The reason this is better than the family guy is it isn't an MA rip off of The Simpsons (scary when you see The Simpson/ Family Guy crossover - how much ch they really stole). Seth MacFarlane is a funny guy - a million ways to die in the west, the first Ted, head of the Friars club, ..., This is a piece of grade A TV that demonstrates how funny AND original"
"I have no idea why, I can't stand this show, its vibe or something. I try and watch one show and I either find my self bored or wonder why I bothered to watch it. I mean, I watched the first episode and it blew chunks. Now every time I watch it I only manage 5 or 6 minutes, that first episode left a huge imprint on me overall, I hate all the characters, especially the alien and the kid, and a lot of them have really annoying voices. I don't know if I have to watch a lot of episodes to get use to this nonsense or just stay away from it completely. For those of you who like this show good job. But I sure don't."
"When you look up most underrated shows of all-time I guarantee you that you'll find Deadwood near the top of every list you find. This is truly a special show! Deadwood takes place in a fictional mining town in the U. S. post Civil War years. It's a lawless town that attracts people that like it doesn't have organized law and people looking to strike it rich after a huge gold strike. It is more than just a great western show, it's just a flat out great show in general! Everything about it is top notch. It's so good they even had to come back and make a movie over 15 years after it aired! Deadwood is not only on every most ""underrated show ever"" list that you'll find but you'll also find it on just about every ""best show ever"" list too. If you're a fan of westerns and looking for a great show to binge then give this a try."
"If you want to experience the – real – old west first hand, look no further; you'll find it in 'Deadwood'. There has never been a show or a film that came as close to showing what life must have been like in those lawless young towns that got built nearly over night wherever gold was found. A magnet for all kind of fortune seekers (gold diggers, whores, outlaws – but also settlers who were just hoping to build a better life), the town of Deadwood was notorious even by the standards of the time. In the show, this ""cesspool of vice"" is brought back to life with great attention to historical detail. You'll find no romanticised view of pioneers who lived and died by ""the code of honour"", but real people whose moral standards are – in most cases – murky at best. And the world they inhabit is a rough, dirty, violent place where only the fiercest – and the most cunning – survive.

As far as the historical characters depicted in the show are concerned, the writers naturally had to take some liberties (after all, nobody knows exactly who said or did what at the time), but the depiction of the era and the historical background are very accurate. Yet this is not a history lesson; it's an immensely entertaining western-show blessed with some of the best writers and actors working in television and film today – and especially the cast of 'Deadwood' really can't get enough praise: there is not a single performance here that isn't excellent. Of course, the one who steals the show is Ian McShane. His Al Swearengen is one of the most morally complex and fun-to-watch characters I've ever seen (and he misses absolutely no opportunity to show you just what the first five letters in ""SWEAR-engen"" stand for). The power-struggles in Deadwood he is involved in – and since he wants to maintain his position at the top of the food-chain he's involved in all of them – are equalled in complexity and entertainment value only by those in top-notch shows like 'Game of Thrones', 'House of Cards' or 'Breaking Bad'. And the lengths Al is willing to go to achieve his goals secure him a place in the top ten of ""all-time great bad-asses"".

So my verdict: While certainly not for the easily offended or those who prefer a ""sanitized version"" of the old west, 'Deadwood' offers a fascinating look at a time we mostly know from myths and legends and gives us a chance to revisit those and see them from a different angle. Great, intelligent and informative entertainment. 9 stars out of 10.

"Deadwood truly is a special show! It is more than just a great western show, it's just a flat out great show in general! Everything about it is top notch. It's so good they even had to come back and make a movie over 15 years after it aired! Deadwood is on just about every ""best show ever"" list that you can find for a reason...because it is!"
"Perfect is a word that should pretty much never be used. Yet, this series Deadwood is indeed perfect (in my opinion of course).

The long-awaited movie sadly doesn't meet the original series' tenacity or energy, As perfect as the series is, it too sadly fell prey to being cancelled before its time. Anyone who's watched it in full will know what I'm talking about, but anyone yet to watch it, I won't spoil it for you.

I watched Deadwood when it was originally airing back in 2004, when I was 15, and often found it hard to understand everything they were saying lol, due to it's Shakespearean eloquence that for many native English speakers requires English subtitles. I revisited the series in 2014 when friends of a friend starting talking about it, and so that late friend of mine (God rest his soul) and I re-watched it all on his projector screen, and we couldn't stop laughing and cussing and using the term ""cocksucka!"" in every other sentence of our every day conversations, haha!

I'm re-watching the first episode as I type out this review, and my god is it truly awesome."
"This stands out for me as one of the best series I have ever seen hit the small screen. The attention to detail,story and character is second to none. Deadwood is brought to life by the good, the bad and the very ugly- with some of the most wonderfully theatrically profane, but ultra-realistic dialogue of any western. True, you could question some of the dialogue for exactly how accurate it is to the time it is set- but it sounds absolutely convincing in the world they have managed to build. Lets face it- not too many Westerns even bothered all that much in the first place! The 3 series have impeccable standards of production, weaving some of the real historical events of the time into a fictional Old West testament. The degradation, ill manners, costumes, dirt, mud and profanities are all present and accounted for.

Aside from the ""real"" characters we know of from Deadwood (Wild Bill Hickok, Calamity Jane and even the Sheriff Bullock), we have some of the most unsavoury villains of the time as well.

The various stories, historical events and personal issues of the characters interweave with no discernible template or pattern to formalise the show. The only thing that is certain in the old West is that where the desire for excess, fortune and greed are combined, human nature will see to the rest.

Stand out performances are plentiful in this series- but Ian McShane is incredible, a true tour-de-force, a foul-mouthed, back-stabbing bad ass villain- who manages to humanise a repellent character in Al Swearengen.

As the series wore on, the writers broadened his character and nature a little more so it was unavoidable but to side with him- even agree with his nastiest ideas.

This was not a compromise or sell-out of the principally dark natured and notoriously ill-tempered brothel owner! ""Sparks"" of humanity seem to have warmed his character, particularly from his confrontations with the flint-like moral code & core of Sheriff Bullock (Timothy Olyphant). However, even Bullocks is prone to questionable actions, as he wrestles with his own conscience to resolve things in a ""civil"" way, or resort to a pistol-whipping to get the job done.

If you have never seen this- look out for repeats or go buy the box sets and enjoy the best Western experience ever made. My only regret is that its all over after 3 series (apart from a couple of 2 hour specials they plan to make to round it off.) Short but ever so sweet!!"
"Absolutely superb. I don't think I've ever given anything a 10/10 before, but for a TV show, Deadwood is excellent - and given the crap we're generally subjected to on the box, absolutely outstanding. The sets, the research, the directing, the characters, the acting - all shine. And without wanting to sound gushy, the script is close to Shakespearian in its prosaic yet pragmatic tone. The juxtaposition of the grit and dirt and blood of the real 'Wild West' with formal Victorian language is genius. Even the opening credits are beautiful. It may not be everyone's cup of tea (the language and content can be a little 'strong' although entirely appropriate and in context) but anyone who's a fan of quality entertainment, shouldn't go past it."
"Just re-watched in 2023 after years. The brilliance of Ian Mcshane and Brad Dourif's performances as Al and the Doc continue to shine incandescently.

This remains in my top three shows of all time and casts heavy shade over the ordinariness of the streaming era dross that we trawl through in the vain hope of finding something of genuine quality.

The secondary characters are so well written and so consistent, and the stories of all are engaging. There is no filler and no worthless, disinteresting meandering. It all moves along seamlessly.

If you don't mind occasional swearing, if you rated Yellowstone, give this a watch to experience real quality."
"Hands down the best show ever written! Sopranos, Breaking Bad, The Wire are fantastic, well written shows as well but Deadwood beats them all hands down. The Deadwood movie premieres tomorrow night. I'm sure it won't disappoint."
"Don't get me wrong, there have been great westerns to come before Deadwood, but none of them really got it right. There is just a reality that some people aren't willing to deal that after 50 years of our history being whitewashed through film and TV, we're finally starting to see the truth. David Milch has done his research and discovered the wonderfully bizarre contradiction of languages used in the old west. Watching the cast of Deadwood converse with a combination of old world English laced with profanity straight from the gutter is incredible and feels right for the first time. Where do people think our language came from? People always want to think that they were the first to do something, when things like profanity, substance abuse and prostitution have been around since before man walked erect.

Along with the incredible dialog and storytelling, David Milch has introduced possibly the greatest character to ever come to TV or film...Al Swearengen. Ian McShane plays Al with the same intense conviction and truth that the character himself lives by. In Al's world things are black and white and never apologizes for a second for living his life by a strict code of morals of his own making. I don't think we've ever seen a character go from crying after a mercy killing to watching a murder he orchestrated stone faced.

This is indeed a special show that is continuing to pave the way for the facts of our history to finally be told with truth...Instead of the whitewashing we've seen our whole lives to make us feel better about ourselves."
"Ian McShane as the evil Al has established himself as one of the greatest actors of the moment and of the time. He's up there with Pacino, DeNiro and Keitel. The magnificent writing and directing of Deadwood support him completely in mesmerizing the audience. This is for my money the finest work being done on television today. The show has a sure moral compass and a daring to take the violence to the level of Shakespeare or the Greek Tragedy while maintaining verisimilitude with brilliant dialogue and perfect art and set direction, as well as a flawless supporting cast each of whom engages us immediately and convincingly no matter how intimate or distant the focus might be. I can't get enough of this show. I want to see it all in reruns, to cherish it later on DVD. Each episode is fresh and surprising and at times astonishing. But Ian McShane steals the show, no question of it. His face is profoundly expressive and his lines are so marvelous that some of them surely must be ad lib. The guy's a scoundrel but my heart's breaking for him. The Season Finale was the single greatest television drama I've ever seen. We have here a villain who isn't morally bankrupt. And thank heaven, we have a show runner and a writer who isn't morally bankrupt either. Bravo!! I've run out of superlatives. Please, more. And more. And more."
"Deadwood is my favorite television drama of all time. I can't think of another show with such depth, complexity and humanity. Throughout its original run I was consistently surprised and impressed. I return to the series every few years, and my fondness for it just grows. Every performance on this show is a revelation. It has the most consistently talented ensemble cast I've ever seen. My only regret is that it was cancelled before it came to a proper resolution."
"I read about this for years before being able to get a hold of a copy of the DVD set (first season), and how wonderful and unique and groundbreaking it was. Gee, what a letdown! There is nothing special or even original in this series, except perhaps for using the ""f"" word three times in every sentence. Unless you are a very juvenile type, this gets mind-numbingly boring after a few episodes. (Interviews with Mr. Milch, who swears about as much as his main characters, suggests that he is referencing his own behavior and not the norms of the Old West.)

The REAL Deadwood was a fascinating place that existed for a very brief time, before becoming a sort of ghost town tourist attraction. Some traditional westerns show the violent action set in places that eventually grew into sober, stable cities and towns -- not the case here. That sense that Deadwood is doomed is entirely lost in translation, though.

Is the profanity realistic? (The DVD even features a short documentary talking a bit about this.) In my opinion, NO. While rough miners and brothel owners undoubtedly used profanity in 1876, it was not identical to the profanity we use today. The ""f"" word dates back to the Shakespearean era (if not earlier), but it was used as a verb to describe sexual activity and NOT as an adjective, modifying literally every noun. This is entirely a modern adaptation of that word. As such, it is as out of place in 1876 as cell phones and i-pods.

There WAS a lot of profanity, but what was considered profane in the 19th century were phrases like ""god damn"" or ""blast"" or ""tarnation"" -- seriously, those were heavy duty, obscene swear words.

Another problem I have is with the depiction of women -- and I mean how they are dressed. (For the record, I studied both fashion and historical costume at the university level, with the intent of being a curator at a fashion museum.) Modern day filmmakers have long had a problem with the fact that prior to the present era (post 1960s), virtually all adult women wore their hair UP. The modern fashion of long, loose hair simply did not exist -- it would have been stranger to see a woman with her hair all about than to see her walking down the street naked. Part of the reason was that nobody had the resources (detergent soaps, unlimited hot water) to wash their hair on a daily basis as we do today. Nor did they have hair dryers! Washing one's hair meant taking many hours to let it dry -- and possibly in cold or windy weather...it would have been impossible.

Look at photos from the era: every woman, even whores, are wearing hair elaborately styled UP, often greasy looking to our modern eyes, but firmly arranged with lots of hair pins. Most women wore hats in public -- most men, too. It entirely ruins a period film for me when women are shown with long loose contemporary hair, not to mention things like eye makeup and lip gloss. Bad form and certainly not within the ""ultra realistic"" premise of ""Deadwood"".

On top of that, all the women depicted are rail thin, per the present desire for a very thin body. However, that style is fairly recent, and would have seemed very bizarre to anyone from the 19th century -- this was the absolute era of plump, curvy, corseted women (fat by our odd standards). Of course, some individual women were thin, perhaps sickly or even consumptive, but this would NOT be considered attractive.

I could go on -- no woman would have appeared on the public streets undressed, in short garments exposing her bare legs, in underwear, etc. -- not even a whore. (If you look at actual photos of 19th century prostitutes, they are wearing normal, if gaudy, clothing.) Any community of Deadwood's size (about 10,000) would have had some children. Where there are women, even whores, there are going to be babies -- that's simple biology. Birth control was non-existent at the time, and yes, prostitutes did get pregnant.

Basically, this is a stupid, badly researched show made largely for the kind of childish audience that thrives on potty mouth stuff like South Park, where genuine humor and cleverness is undone by a constant need to use shock swear words (in that case, coming out of the mouths of cartoon kids). On the positive side, some excellent performers, including the rightly praised Ian MacShane as Swearingen (based on a real life Deadwood resident, but how lame is it to take a character with such a name and have him ""swear"" a lot???), the excellent Powers Boothe, and Keith Carradine in one of his very best roles.

This would have been vastly better as a trimmed down, four-to-six hour mini-series...with swearing and costumes true to the era. A wasted opportunity and vastly overpraised. Don't bother to subscribe to cable for this -- I got the DVD set at my library for free."
"Deadwood is the Apex of the western genre. It is absolutely the best series ever written, acted and directed. The character development is simply astonishing. Gritty, realistic, and true to life this series most likely will never be topped in many categories. Al Swearengen represents probably, the greatest character in TV series history. Ian McShane is simply magnificent in unraveling a complex character over the course of the series to be not what you think he is at the beginning to who he really is as a man. I've watched Deadwood 10 times and still enjoy every minute and unravel new things about the complexities of human nature each time I watch this magnificent series."
"I watched DEADWOOD during its original run and have been evangelizing it, and regularly revisiting it ever since. For a series that I originally thought to be ""Excellent"", it's astounding to me how much newness and elevated greatness I find in the series with each subsequent revisit over the years. The success, and beauty of this story telling is the community that is ""Deadwood"". Creator David Milch set out to tell a story about a burgeoning civilization and in his quest to do so, unlocked a universal beauty, an absolute truth, community begets family, begets, progress begets endless storytelling. The never meant to be final third season is peppered with promise of future connections and stories that we never got to see. This writer would personally have been delighted to see how supporting characters John Langrishe further worked his way into the council of elders. Or, the continuance of dear, defensive Charlie Utter's coming to understanding, and cracking a smile when dealing with Al's heavy seconds at the Gem. Growth and build are constants in this story. I would have loved to have seen more of it. I would have loved if it never ended."
"Watching an Old West movie is fine but if you truly want to go in depth; the very core of the everyday life of a COWBOY, please looks no further, DEADWOD is your destination. From the moment the sheriff made the move along with his partner to that small little town, you could anticipate the drama coming. I would like to praise all the actors who tool part in this special project, a masterpiece of events after on anther. Imagine combining the adventures of Josie Wells with True Grit boom, instant impact, some characters will have you latching on to them, but please understand that you will be surprised, so please try to enjoy each episodes with attentive care. I'm hoping that they find a way to reboot this show again in the near future."
"I'd been hearing about Deadwood from my friends for some time and figured they must be wrong; nothing could be that good. Guess what?... I was wrong! Deadwood is without doubt the most enjoyable series I have ever watched. It's gritty, course, violent and foul, that's what makes it great. I have a brother who worked in mining camps in Canada in the 1970's. When one camp was being struck they found three bodies of guys that had never been missed! He reckons Deadwood is right on the mark. The quality of script and acting is top-shelf. The fact that (allowing for the necessary poetic license needed ) it is a true story makes it absolutely fascinating. I have no hesitation in recommending this wonderful series to anyone."
"I felt I needed to write after reading the comment made of the show. Everyone is entitled to an opinion but the individual the wrote the comment ""Falls Short"" does not know anything. I live in Deadwood and with the exception of stuff added by Hollywood to quicken the story it is quite close to our history. None of the characters are fictional, the all lived at one time. I admit the show in vulgar but cleans up as the show continues and the town grows from a miner's camp to a town. Don't let the first few episodes scare you off. The show is very good and quite close to the truth. If you like old west history you will love Deadwood."
"There is much to recommend ""Deadwood"" -- performances, dialogue, sets, cinematography, all contributing to it being one of the best television series of all time. But for Ian McShane's performance alone, the best and most powerful ever on the small screen, all lovers of film are obligated to watch. I am left breathless with my bottom jaw dropped every time he is on screen.

This isn't to say other performances aren't superb. Brad Dourif and Robin Weigert are especially noteworthy, and it's great to have Powers Boothe's calculated ""cool"" back on the screen.

Despite setting and time frame, this is by no means a typical ""western"". Those who appreciate the genre are by no means assured of enjoying it, but, conversely, people who don't usually enjoy westerns shouldn't let the format scare them off.

Dialogue is unlike anything ever heard in film. It regularly veers into the poetic and the surreal with long sentences and monologues being a mix of educated grammar and rough slang. I am frequently distracted from the meaning by the beauty of its sound.

Not to be missed!!!"
"Someone has claimed to be a Deadwood resident and that the characters of Deadwood actually existed.

Some of them did, true.

Seth Bullock is probably fairly accurately portrayed. His wife was Martha Bullock (his childhood sweetheart, not his brother's widow). They had a daughter (Madge), not a son. His partner Sol Star also existed and the characterization is probably fairly accurate.

Albert W. Merrick, Tom Nuttall and Reverend Smith are all real characters. Each's history is dramatically misrepresented in the series. Con Stapleton also actually existed... he was elected Sheriff (not appointed by Swearengen).

Johnny Burns and Dan Doherty (not Dority as the show spells it) existed and worked for Swearengen, and yes, Al Swearengen existed (but he wasn't born in England - nor is the Gem accurately portrayed).

Calamity Jane, Hickok, and Charlie Utter were all real people and probably fairly accurately portrayed (except that Utter was fastidious in real life). So is Jack McCall.

Wyatt Earp did come to Deadwood. For one week. Is his portrayal accurate? Unlikely.

E.B. Farnum was a real character. His portrayal is definitely not accurate.

Samuel Fields was a real person, but not likely to have been much like the character in the show.

George Hearst was a real person too. The show takes great liberties with known facts in how Hearst is portrayed, and the same is probably true of the portrayal of John Langrishe (Langrishe temporarily operated out of the Bella Union, not a bordello). Aunt Lou also existed, but she didn't work for Hearst.

Fictional Characters:

Cy Tolliver (Tim Miller owned the Bella Union) Alma Garret Doc Cochran (possibly the amalgamation of a couple of camp MDs) Joanie Stubbs (possibly the amalgamation of a couple of madams)

Many others.

As for the language, anyone who thinks that it is accurate? Isn't thinking very well. In an environment without law, people would tend to be very polite rather than overly obscene. Historic evidence from the era does indicate that obscenities of the time were in common use between people who were comfortable with each other. Between those who didn't? Saying the wrong thing could get someone killed. And did. An armed society is a polite society. This was an armed society. Idiocy like Swearengen's ""F*** You"" to Seth Bullock not long after meeting him? Is the kind of stupidity that would have got him killed. The real Al Swearengen lived a fairly long life. He was a brutal man. He was not stupid.

Deadwood is a mix of history and fiction for entertainment's sake. Anyone who thinks it reflects the reality of frontier life, or of historic Deadwood is kidding themselves. It's entertaining. Take it at that."
"I've been a fan of HBO since I saw Band of Brothers on Dutch television. Unfortunately, the Dutch television companies don't know anything about good programming. Most television series are cut short during the season so that the second part of the season can be shown the next year. Sometimes when they stop mid season, the rest of the episodes aren't shown at all and they start all over again. This is one of the reasons that I don't watch series on Dutch television. I usually rent or borrow the DVD's. Although we get to see most popular HBO series (Carnivàle, Sopranos, Six Feet Under) I never watch them on television. Although I'd never seen the show, I decided to buy the DVD after reading some reviews. Thank God I did!

Deadwood is a very very good show. The setting of this drama is the town in the title. Deadwood is a town where there is no law and where anything goes. Seth Bullock, sheriff in Montana and his partner Sol Star, decide to leave Montana and depart for Deadwood after hanging their last prisoner. When arriving in Deadwood they set out to buy some property so that they can build their hardware store. Before they've actually purchased the ground, you've met all characters including E.B. Farnum (hotel owner), Wild Bill Hickok and Calamity Jane. This show's strong point is its character driven storyline. The characters are so well cast that you have no problem accepting them. The foul mouth of Al Swearengen, the short temper of Bullock or the preaching's of the reverend are features that you'll come to love. All characters have certain features that you love about them, even the bad guys. In addition, all characters have certain features you really hate, even the good guys.

This show is so well written that you'll be on the edge of your seat with suspense or you'll be laughing your ass off because of the brilliant and funny lines. An example; Commissioner Jarry has been imprisoned to keep him safe from a mob. Calamity Jane is guarding him.

Jarry: I'm thirsty! Jane: Lie on your back, take aim and p!ss!

This show has so many great lines that it is hard to pick a favorite. One thing people might not like about the show is the amount of swearing. Some may think it's too much but I'm not bothered by the amount of swearing. Most great lines are delivered with a couple of swear words and yes you'll get used to the swearing and I found myself even using some of them on my friends... Euhmm, anyway, about the language, some may also have problems following the show because of the use of Western Period English. My native tongue is Dutch and although my English is pretty good (don't have to watch movies with subs :P) I had a hard time following the show without the English subtitles. I don't have problems with the English itself, but a lot of the dialogue is very specific for the period. Words like, Hooplehead, Squarehead and sentences like ""My bicycle masters boardwalk and quagmire with aplomb"" got me stumped for a while. Just turn on the subtitles or you might miss some of the amazing dialogue.

One last thing about this show. The last episode of season 1 has to be the best finale to a season I've ever seen! Sold Under Sin is so good you'll certainly shed a tear.

This show is brilliant! Just, brilliant!

10 out of 10 stars."
"Over the years, we've seen a lot of preposterous things done by writers when the show just had to go on no matter what, keeping ""8 Simple Rules"" going after John Ritter died comes to mind, but this is probably the first time I cared. The idea of having ""That 70's Show"" without Eric or to a lesser extent Kelso is ridiculous. They tried to cover it up with a comeback of Leo and increasingly outrageous story lines, but it always felt like why bother when you don't have a main character anymore. It just didn't really connect, it was a bunch of unrelated stuff happening that most of the time wasn't even funny. The last season felt like the season too much for every single character, simply because Eric used to take a lot of screen time and now we'd be smashed in the face by how stale and repetitive the rest of the characters were. Focusing on the gimmick that is Fez was thoroughly uninteresting and the character would simply stop working, because the whole deal was that he'd say something weird from out of nowhere, and you can't say stuff from out of nowhere when every second line is yours. They also brought in the standard cousin Oliver, only this time it just wasn't a kid. Whenever you heard somebody knock on the door, you started praying it wasn't Randy, please let it not be Randy. The deal with Randy was that he'd do really awful jokes, usually as Red would say, smiling like an ass and totally screwing up delivery and Donna would be in stitches. I think more than half of the last season was Donna pretending to be amused. The problems had started earlier though: what once was a truly great show with an equally great concept that for once wasn't about a dysfunctional family slowly got into the territory of soap opera. Everybody started being in love with everybody, emotional scenes were dragged out at nausea, with just one usually lame joke placed somewhere to divert attention that we were watching ""As The World Turns"". I'm guessing this was character development, but come on that was written almost as clumsily as the moral lessons from ""Family Matters"". To be fair, the last episode, also because it had a cameo by Topher Grace (a cameo in his own show), was really good, even if not that funny either.

By the way, yet more criticism on Season 8: what the hell was with the opening theme? Not only did they use the same joke twice (a character not singing), Fez scared the hell out of me. Dude, don't open your eyes that far. But the first five seasons or so,among the best comedy ever broadcast."
"I didn't start to watch ""That '70s show"" until about a year or so ago and I sure wish that I would have started tuning in a lot earlier. This series is really funny, really different, and has an amazing cast.

In my opinion, this is one of the best casts assembled in a long time. Everybody makes me laugh (especially Eric and Fez). All of the characters are likable and each actor puts in that little something each week that is needed to make a television series survive. Topher Grace is really great and I still can't believe that he didn't have any acting experience prior to this show. That's one of the best things about this show - all of the actors really had no acting gigs and just fell into the roles immediately.

The writers are extremely funny. Although the writing is simple at times, it's unpredictable the next, and that's what I like. Each episode has good scenarios/plots and always makes me laugh.

Everything about it is good and it's not the same as all of the other shows that are currently on TV. It stands out with an excellent cast (and an excellent theme song. That thing gets stuck in my head so easily.) I like the seventies, I like this show, but was ""That '80s Show"" really necessary?"
Till this day I am still always watching episode of this show. Will forever be my favorite.
"This show has come so far. At first EVERYONE in the cast from Eric to Fez, they were all new actors and actresses, fresh faces, and just look what they accomplished. They stuck with the show and it was a success. Its one of the best shows ever made and its probably the funniest sitcom I've ever seen in my life. It will be sad to see it end but if they end this show, I hope to God that the series finale goes out with one of the biggest bangs that any season finale has ever had. I don't care if the whole season sucks because they save all the fuel for the final episode. Go down swinging, get one last punch in. The show deserves it, the fans deserve it, if they go, let everyone know its going to end, like on Friends, and let the finale be huge. I say get Donna and Eric married, I say have Hyde and Kelso fight and become friends again, I say have something interesting happen between Fez and Jackie because Fez has been trying for so long, but of course it wont work out for him. JUST CLOSE OUT THE SERIES BIG TIME GUYS!

That 70s Show will always be the best in my eyes. Eric, Kelso, Donna, Jackie, Fez, Hyde, I wish I had you guys as friends. You are the best!

10/10..."
"How does an usual day start in Point Place, Wisconsin...

First of all, Red, the tyrannical father of the Forman family and a WWII veteran, sits at the kitchen table and reads his newspaper while his overjoyed wife Kitty serves breakfast. Then comes their skinny son, Eric, he sits at the table as well, and his father starts his daily yelling, usually involving placing his foot in Eric's behind if (insert reason here). If his promiscuous angel-faced sister Laurie is at home, she comes along, then Red stops yelling and kindly talks to her, making Eric feel left out of the family.

Once this daily (painful) ritual is over, Eric rushes down to his basement, where all his friends are already hanging out. And when we get to see them, it becomes obvious Eric and his redhead tomboy girlfriend, next-door neighbor and childhood friend Donna Pinciotti are the sanest people around. Meet Steven Hyde, the conspiracy theorist who hates disco and doesn't really care about what's around as long as it's not funny to watch; Michael Kelso, the kind of guy who thinks that he will get through his life only by his looks and that carrots grow in trees; Jackie Burkhardt, the one who thinks of herself as the prettiest girl around, spoiled kid of a rich father, and, of course, cheerleader; and Fez, a naive but oversexed foreigner who loves candy and can't keep a secret. At first they simply hang out, gossiping and making fun of Kelso, but then they all sit in a circle and let the real fun begin... before going out doing something they'll regret later.

Meanwhile Red goes out and meets Donna's weirdo parents, Bob and Midge. He's rude, but they don't mind, as they think he's joking. Somewhere around is Leo, an aging hippie, who's constantly confused and makes word plays without even noticing.

Did you imagine that seemingly peaceful neighborhood with all these awesome characters? Of course, most seem ""clichéd"", but the show takes the cliché to a new level. Now throw in some of the most wicked story lines a sitcom can offer, sit down and enjoy one of the best TV shows ever. The one that never does two times the same thing and which is, compared to most sitcoms that are ""cute funny"", purely hysterical. If you get hooked, don't let this show let you go. Bite on the hook over and over and, man, you will see the sitcom genre from a whole new prospective."
"... and the series lets you forget all that. I am about three years older than the kids portrayed in the series. Born in 1958, I learned to drive during the first gas shortage, and got my first post-college graduation job during the second gas shortage in 1979. The 70's were a truly dreadful time to be young - inflation, competing for after-school minimum-wage jobs with laid-off thirty-somethings, dreadful music, worse clothes.

The funny thing is, this series doesn't ignore any of that and still manages to make the 70's look fun, even for those of us old enough to know better. It manages to look the 70's directly in the face - complete with time-authentic clothing - and yet fill the show with the hopefulness of youth and the things that make the high school and college years both the best of times and the worst of times. Then there are the parents. The two young lovers in the show - Eric Forman and Donna Pinciotti - truly have dreadful parents with the best of intentions. Eric's parents, Red and Kitty, are not exactly June and Ward although they are conventional for the decade. They represent what happened when the 60's finally reached the suburbs during the 1970's. Donna's parents are two people who have been waiting for the 1960's to show up their whole lives in order to give their weirdness legitimacy. Eric's friends Fez, Kelso, and Jackie round out the group representing nerdiness, well-meaning incompetence, and snobbishness respectively. Hyde is an unusual teenager for a show about the suburbs, but he largely represents someone who has to play the cards he was dealt even when those cards are dealt by largely absentee and negligent parents. I highly recommend all eight seasons even though season eight does lag a bit due to the absence of Eric."
"No matter what mood you are in, you can always sit down a watch this great feel good and funny show. A group of best friends that Really have fun and enjoy each other's company."
"I guess that one might say that ""That '70s Show"" is to the 1990s what ""Happy Days"" was to the 1970s: a look at how cool things were twenty years earlier in Wisconsin. And they do a great job with it. The characters are: Eric Foreman (Topher Grace), a sometimes clueless high school student; Donna Pinciotti (Laura Prepon), Eric's strong-willed friend; Michael Kelso (Ashton Kutcher), a complete imbecile; Jackie Burkhart (Mila Kunis), the vain, egotistical member of the group; Steven Hyde (Danny Masterson), the cynical member of the group; Fez (Wilmer Valderrama), a foreign exchange student who always tries to be cool; Red (Kurtwood Smith), Eric's hard-ass father; and Kitty (Debra Jo Rupp), Eric's jolly mother.

Tommy Chong occasionally appears as Hyde's stoner boss Leo. Throughout the series, the circle of friends comes across all sorts of situations, which usually end up accentuating Kelso's stupidity or Hyde's distrust of authority. Oftentimes, they assess everything through popular culture (namely disco or any TV show that had existed up to that point). But no matter what happens, it's always safe to assume that Red will threaten to kick someone in the ass, or at least call someone a dumb-ass.

Either way, it's a great show. You gotta see it."
"I give 8/10 and i could give less cause season 8 was HORRIBLE! the worst season i ever seen in a show. Eric left,kelso left and you tried to replace these guys with this blonde dude who haven't been fun at all! Best to stop the show at season 7 and not at season 8. this show was something like friends and now imagine friends ending with 2 base actors not being there! was the worst season i ever seen so i give 8/10 on IMDb but to my friends i say like 6,5-7/10! i suggest to watch this but until season 7! season 8 is really bad! so this is a very good series to watch and i believe you could make a new one with these actors if they are alive at all but please if you make a new one don't ruin it like this one!i really loved the show but season 8 just ruined it."
"I started watching this on netflix and was hooked from the first episode, this show is incredibly funny with great characters

Would highly recommend"
I can't believe we don't have that 70's show anymore. I have all 8 seasons of that 70's show!! I absolutely Love It!! I lay in the bed every night and watch several episodes before I go to sleep. At the end of a long busy day it's nice to kick back and have a great laugh before you go to sleep. I was so sad they took the show off air... at least we still have the re-runs!! I am hoping and praying they will come back with at least a reunion...Like maybe when Donna finishes college and we finally get to see her and Eric get married!!!! Wouldn't that be awesome!!! It would be even better if they would continue it for several years!!
"Am I the only person who believes that EVERY show should end after 3 seasons? This show started out so funny and the original idea was wonderful. But after season 3 it got weighed down by re-tooled scripts, character swaps and relationship nonsense. In my humble opinion, when 2 of your leads leave the show, have the smarts to end it."
The lightning in a bottle from having chemistry between the cast members from the beginning and genuinely funny jokes I cannot even watch That 90's Show. This has been highlighted so much by seeing how bad it could have been in comparison when using the same format and many characters. This was a period piece for many doing a great job in capturing 70's nostalgia from what I've heard watching with my grandparents. The humor was raunchy at times but never over the top. Romantic parts were balanced out well with comedy and when there was a weakness in performance from an actor it was quickly balanced out by the strength and stage presence of the others.
"I really love this show, it turned me into one of those ""things used to be better in the old days"" because they're no sitcoms like this anymore. One of my favorite things about it is back then, when something was funny, it was funny and they said it; no fear of being canceled off air or excoriated by a movement or rights group. It's also nice to see where so many actors careers began, and I love how every character in the show is likable and funny for different reasons and the chemistry they share. Despite it being really funny, behind all that humor was something you could relate to and become attached to the characters as well; it was Eric and Donna that hit me the most. When Eric told Donna ""if you can see a future without me in it and that doesn't break your heart then we're not doing what we thought we were doing here""; I'd seen that quote so many times before I actually watched the show and it hit so hard when I got to it because I didn't realize how attached I grew to the characters, it was all just a comedy sitcom to me.

Also, this being based in the 70's and made in 1998 made me realize all our generations go through the same things, sure music tastes or fashion was different but at that age it seems every generation is basically has similar mindsets and want the same things. Kids rebel the same way, fall in love the same way, look at school the same way, think their parents are uncool the same way. That's why even though I watched this in 2021 I could relate to so much and have a laugh about it. It'll never be irrelevant. Red is special though, given us so many one liners, always ready to stick his foot in someone's ass. Kelso's stupidly is also something to behold and Hyde's conspiracy theories, fez, Jackie, Bob, Laurie... all of them. You can't recreate that.

""That 80's show"" failed miserably which is why I don't understand why they're now attempting ""that 90's show"" as well. I feel like my reaction will be the same as that of HIMYM fans reaction to How I Met Your Father; and I don't want that disappointment."
I adore this show its hilarious. The only thing I dont like about the show is the eight season. In my opinion there was no reason to have a eight season.
"I have never understood the appeal of this show. The acting is poor (Debra Jo Rupp and the actor who plays her on-screen husband being two notable exceptions), the plots of most episodes are trite and uninspiring, the dialogue is weak, the jokes unfunny and it is painful to try and sit through even half an episode. Furthermore the link between this show and the '70s' is extremely tenuous beyond the style of dress and the scenery and background used for the show -it seems to be nothing more than a modern sitcom with the same old unfunny, clichéd scripts that modern sitcoms have dressed up as depicting a show from twenty years ago in the hope that it will gain some nostalgic viewers or something like that. Both ""Happy Days"" and ""The Wonder Years"" employ the same technique much more effectively and are actually a pleasure to watch in contrast to this horrible, pathetic excuse for a show"
"Mad Men was such a terrific show that is absolutely just as good as everyone says it is. I never watched it when it was originally on but after hearing so many great things about it I finally gave it a chance and streamed it. I was blown away but how much I loved it. There's a reason it won so many awards when it was on...because it's terrific! The acting, writing, directing, production, attention to detail, etc are all among the best in television history! I can see why some people may not like it because it does starts off a little slow but give it a few episodes because it absolutely pays off and then you won't want to stop watching it until you binge the entire series!"
"When I started watching Mad Men, the rhythm of it felt slow.

Pretty quickly did I realize how much more powerful the slow story & plot development rhythm would be, allowing us to discover the characters, mostly in seasons 1 and 2, and then really be in the thick of it in subsequent seasons.

Indeed, this series has pushed character development so far that they are the entire and only reason why this series is interesting. The actual events happening at the advertising agency is a pretext to throw more things at those characters and have them deal with it. In fact, the characters are so interesting that there is practically no violence needed (except a few minor events) over 7 seasons to keep this series going. I find that tremendously respectable to be able to craft a series in this way, not using gun shots and bombs to make it lively.

Finally, I have not lived in the early 60's time period the series is set in, but I can only say that it's all seemed to me very interesting and all these ""vintinge"" props and costumes, hair style and such made it all the more fascinating to watch.

Absolutely great work."
"Mad Men is one of my favorite shows ever. It was one of the most talked about shows when it was on, it's the reason I started watching it. I wanted to see if the show could live up to all the hype surrounding it and it did. It surpassed my expectations in every way. It actually ended up being one of my favorite shows. The entire cast is brilliant but this is Jon Hamm's show. His character, Don Draper, is iconic. Hamm was so good that he was nominated for an Emmy for all seven seasons the show was on and even won for best male actor. The show itself was also nominated for an Emmy for best drama for all seven seasons and even won a few times. In all the show won 16 Emmys and had over 116 different nominations. I'll say that again in case you thought it was a misprint...Mad Men was nominated for 116 different Emmy awards! That alone should tell you how legendary this show is. I love it so much I plan on watching it all the way through again in the near future."
"The brilliance is all in the subtext. There are many hilarious moments that are only funny if you've been paying attention and understand where the character is coming from. There are also many tragic moments that would pass you by if you didn't know what came before. Many lines have double or even triple meanings. Watch this from the beginning, with a friend. Believe me, you will want to discuss each episode afterward to figure out some of the nuances of what happened.

The main Mad Man is the confident womanizer Don Draper, who is head of the Creative department at a mid-sized ad agency in 1960s Madison Avenue. I admit, at first I kind of hated him, but as the viewer learns more about him and his past, I learned to - not love him exactly - but like him and want to watch him endlessly. He is a complicated character who can be a very good man, but also a very bad man.

Don Draper is joined by a rich cast of supporting characters, many of whom deserve a show of their own: The ambitious young Campbell who is utterly sleazy most of the time, but has occasional moments of growth and even cuteness.Peggy Olson starts out as Draper's secretary, but her growth into a strong, confident woman mirrors what is happening for Woman in the 60's. Silver fox Stirling - he may be morally bankrupt but gets some of the best lines. I could go on . . .

The 60's clothes, hairstyles, decor, and current events provide an interesting backdrop for what is essentially a character piece. The setting provides both the occasional laugh (cigarettes being advertised as ""healthy"") and the more than occasional cringe (how could dumping trash from a picnic in the park right on the grass ever seem okay?!).

If you need fast-paced action or a laugh track, this definitely isn't the show for you. But, if you like character development and subtlety in your television shows, rent the first seasons on DVD and settle in. You won't regret it."
"The journey is a most interesting one in Don Draper's universe that occupies a time (1960s) in American culture when changes occurred in warp speed. No Pollyanna view of the world, 'Mad Men' explores the full spectrum of human relationships, personality types, and emotions.

The show's creator Matthew Weiner (previously executive producer/writer of 'The Sopranos') takes viewers on a high-ball roller coaster of human experiences that explore pursuit of bliss, the depths of where one can go, and the winding roads of inner angst one must often travel.

'Mad Men' is the ultimate ensemble drama series with grown-up adult themes that drill deep into the human psyche and often self-destructive behavior patterns of the 1960s post-WWII Greatest Generation that populated the high-flying, high-pressure Madison Avenue ad agencies.

Those ad agencies created the culturally iconic images cast through television, radio and print media during that turbulent, mass-consumption decade in American society, when Baby Boomers started taking over the reigns of influence in America, much of it in conflict with Greatest Gen thinking.

There is nothing low key about 'Mad Men'. Tension and conflict is layered throughout the series. Weiner covers a lot of territory of the human experience that exists inside complex personalities and their relationships, and the intense emotions that often accompany them.

As it stands now, 'Mad Men' is the best TV drama series of all-time; I don't believe there is even a close second.

The show received 4 consecutive ""Outstanding Drama Series"" Emmys (21 total Emmy wins out of 116 nominations) to close out it's relatively brief pre-determined tenure of 7 seasons.

Those who have seen every episode in sequence, experience a level of high-quality TV viewing that sets the bar to the pinnacle, and rivals the best theatrical movies in production, casting, acting, and story-telling.

Matthew Weiner's unique concept alone puts it into a must-try category.

For those who have seen the entire series, it is even better the second, third time around (and one gains value in more rapid linear viewing, rather than having to wait months to see the next season, or a week to watch the next episode).

Marathon binge-viewing of consecutive episodes can be exhausting, but the series' irresistible gravitational force inevitably draws you back into the center of Draper's universe to watch the next episode - You just can't look away.

View 'Mad Men' from episode one, season one. The trip is well worth the time.

"Everyone has a back burner watchlist of TV shows considered to be the greatest. These are often graced by the likes of Breaking Bad, Deadwood, The Wire, The Sopranos, and, of course, Mad Men. Even though these shows may be indeed great, you may be familiar with a weird avoidance mechanism that usually kicks in: we may regard those landmark pieces of TV not very exciting, especially if they are a few years old - not unlike ""must-read"" literary classics that nobody ever reads - and thus we relegate them to the bottom of our watchlists, while we consume the latest, more exciting, and often less fulfilling offers.

Then, when you finally make the effort to watch that landmark series and realize it is every bit as good as everyone said it was, you flagellate yourself thinking why you held back for so long.

This Great-TV-Show-Avoidance-Mechanism happened to me in regards to Mad Men. A show about advertising and corporate people did not seem very exciting to me, and I wasn't really a fan of anyone in the cast (save Elizabeth Olson). Having in the past started to watch best-of-all-time TV shows just to drop them along the way - I'm looking at you, The Sopranos - I kept it on the back burner for a very long time. Now, after consuming all of Mad Men in a relatively short amount of time, I think it is the most consistently good TV show I have ever watched.

Out of the 92 episodes in the entire series on IMDb, I have rated only two a 7. All the rest got a rating of either 8 or 9 (I don't believe in perfection, so 9 is as high as I go). The key word here, alongside consistency, is even-handedness. Even though there are standout episodes, usually popping out unpredictably within seasons, rather than near the end like most other shows, Mad Men's episodes are so well balanced in terms of drama, character development and plot advancement that you feel you are witnessing interesting lives go by - extremely well costumed, photographed, written and acted lives, but fictional nonetheless. Compared to most other shows, there is a refreshing under-reliance on plot twists and melodramatic acting scenes, which now seem to me like the bluntest tools in the writer's bag of tricks to keep viewers tuning in every week. Perhaps Mad Men's greatest achievement is just that: through the power of character and acting alone, it manages to capture the viewers' interest while dispensing with more traditional tricks of storytelling. Of course, other facets of the production, such as the attention to period detail, costume design and cinematography are really good too. But what stands out and keeps us watching is the near-perfect marriage between solid writing, first, and solid acting, second - acting here defined in terms of how perfectly the actors inhabit their roles, not the showy, larger-than-life, award-stealing acting scenes you find in Oscar bait films. And I tell you from experience, the binge pull of the series makes it nearly impossible to watch a single episode in a sitting. I have only been able to pull that off once, with the final episode.

The way the plot is handled is simply masterful. For instance, if a character goes on a quest to achieve something, and we spend some time witnessing the build-up to it, it is not guaranteed they will (ever) succeed, or that at least a lesson will be learned at the end of the day. Things may end up just like they are - a lot like real life. The backdrop of US history unfolding is neither overpowering, i.e., stealing attention from the characters or events at hand, or just a side note mentioned without consequence. These historically-inspired scenes excel in revealing interesting takes on people's attitudes (secretaries crying over Marilyn Monroe's death, for instance) while providing startling contrasts to our times. Another striking feature of the show I'd like to mention is that, now and again, there are a few scenes with unimportant characters - like a child doing something they ought not to do, feeling guilty, and trying to hide it afterwards - that seem to be there mostly to make us feel, ""yes, I have felt this before, this is familiar to me"". Those ""snippets of reality,"" as I call them, serve no narrative purpose whatsoever and don't even advance our understanding of the characters, but they do a great deal to establish the mood and reinforce our connection to the characters, even if indirectly. By including these moments in small amounts and in the right moment, the writers are still able to keep everything on track while disregarding the common writing advice that every scene should either advance the plot or deepen character development (or better yet, both at the same time). By the way, I have rarely seen such ""extraneous"" scenes elsewhere, and when they do appear, they are due mostly to an editor or writer's incompetence rather than to the command of their craft.

On top of all that, the show is also a wonderfully honest piece of television. It does not promise or deliver anything more than what you see on screen. After a couple of seasons, you are likely to be able to predict to a high degree of accuracy how it is all going to end - Mad Men operates within such a well thought out ""narrative system"", with clearly defined bounds, that you know exactly what NOT to expect. The way the series finale begins and ends makes you feel like you are watching just another episode and, miraculously, still manages to satisfy.

In closing, I should note that Mad Men does not provide the blockbuster-y thrills of, say, Game Thrones before it became a catastrophic failure, Westworld in its first season, or Breaking Bad during the Gus Fring phase. Above all, it shows that it is entirely possible to make great, often magnificent, television without any sort of sensationalized acting, clichéd dialogue or narrative acrobatics. I have already completely forgotten Game of Thrones and don't plan on rewatching any time soon. I find it unlikely I will ever do the same to Mad Men."
"One of the greatest shows ever made. The Sopranos, The Wire, Breaking Bad, Better Call Saul, Game of Thrones, Mad Men. That's it. That's the list. If you haven't watched this show you're missing one of the absolute best shows ever made. Top notch acting, costume design, writing, acting, period piece. Watch it."
"This is a perfect show in every sense. The opening credits & animated intro are themselves works of art, and the creative direction makes the series so visually exquisite that you can't take your eyes off the screen even for a moment lest you miss one of the many perfect vignettes. The haunting opening music sets the stage for masterful sound design, ranging from each episode's musical selections to the subtlest of ambient sounds. The camera-work is nothing short of stunning; it loves each character and makes even the background action interesting. Talented cast and every character is watchable & believable.

For a period piece, 'Mad Men' is remarkably fresh. The show is set in 1960, following a decade of post-WWII recovery which, with the help of rampant consumerism, transformed America from an industrial society into a ""leisure society"". One of the most rewarding things about the show is how we get to witness the many cracks which had already begun to form in the manicured facade of the '50s, slowly making way for America's rebellion against the manufactured ""good life"", and resulting in the social & political upheaval of the 1960s and 1970s.

We get to have intimate glimpses into the various components of this process--money, power, politics, sex, race, gender roles-- in a way that makes us feel as if we're actually there in the room with the characters. The show also does a magnificent job of portraying the simultaneous liberation and objectification of women as consumerism rapidly transformed their role in society.

Each and every well-developed character on this show takes his/her turn to unfold in delicate layers. This unfolding is done with pin-point precision and subtlety, and without ever spoon-feeding us. And every new nugget of information is a highly relevant piece of this very addictive puzzle.

"I'll be the first to admit that Mad Men is a show about watching people go to work and live their lives. It should be dull and uninteresting, yet somehow it managed to grip me for a whole 7 seasons and left me wanting more.

The setting is a big part of it. The historical interest of the time (JFK's assassination, the moon landing, England winning the World Cup, to name a few key points in the show) is enough to keep many gripped. It's more than that though. The characters in themselves are worth following and you get invested in them as the seasons progress.

To be frank I didn't like the first season. I just didn't get the formula and was getting close to giving up on the show. I'm glad I didn't though as it only improves from the second season onward."
"Mad Men is one of the best-written and most ambitious TV shows in some time. It is worth close study, not just for learning how to create a well-structured show but also how to write one that is truly original and potentially groundbreaking. Story world, or arena, is one of the key structural elements in any TV drama (see the TV Drama Class for how to create this element, as well as the other essential structural elements of a successful show). It is where the story takes place and it usually exists within some specific arena that not only delineates a recognizable unit but also has a set of rules, activities and values that defines the characters. One of the strengths of Mad Men is its story world. Instead of the usual arena of cops, lawyers, or doctors, Mad Men takes us into a Manhattan advertising agency in 1960. Besides being totally unique in TV, this story world is extremely detailed. And the detailing isn't simply a matter of the set design, which is fabulous. It is written into every episode. The writers weave all manner of cultural icons of the late 50s-early 60s, including TV shows, ads, and fashion. This has two great advantages. One is the pleasure of recognition. If you were a kid at that time, as I was, the show is a virtual time machine. And even if you weren't, the authenticity and texture immerse you in the world and make you feel that ""You are there!"" The other great advantage is that this past world tricks the audience into believing that this is how it really was back then. The first thing we notice when we see all of these details is how much the world has changed. Everybody smoked back then. The men were in charge and the women were all secretaries and housewives. That sets up the kicker. By first thinking how much we've changed, we then realize, with even more impact, all the ways we haven't. This story, set in 1960, is really about today, or more exactly, the ways that human nature only puts on a new skin and the same fundamental challenges of creating a meaningful life must be faced by each of us, every moment of every day. Another structural element that immediately jumps out at you if you want to create a TV show or write for one is the desire line. In Mad Men the desire that structures each episode is fairly nebulous, and that's probably going to cut into the show's popularity (I hope I'm wrong on this one). Desire is the main reason almost all TV shows are set in the cop, lawyer, and doctor arenas. These jobs give their shows a simple and repeatable desire line that tracks the episode every week. Catch the criminal. Win the case. Save the life. But of course this is extremely limiting. Most people don't spend their daily lives solving crimes, prosecuting bad guys, and saving lives. So while the desire line on this show may be more nebulous, it is far closer to what most Americans do in their daily lives. These Mad Men are in the business of selling, which, as Arthur Miller pointed out long ago, is the archetypal American action. But they aren't selling a particular product. They're selling desire, some image of the good life that, because it is a fabricated ideal, is always just out of reach. Writer Matthew Weiner's brilliant conception for this show is to connect the selling of desire to America to the personal and work lives of the ad men themselves. The ad men want the image of the good life in America that they are selling to be true, even if they intellectually make fun of the poor suckers out there who buy it. Main character Don Draper is handsome and talented, with a beautiful wife and two cute little kids. But he has some secrets he's keeping  like a mistress in the city  and he feels a terrible void he has no idea how to shake. Draper is a master at manipulating desire and creating facades, so when he tries to live the promise for real, the ""good life"" falls apart in his hands. We are in Far from Heaven and American Beauty territory here. And the second episode even had Draper give his own version of the Existentialist credo of Sartre and Camus that was seeping into pop culture during the late 50s (how's that for a sweet detail on a TV show?). We'll have to see whether Mad Men can extend beyond a few episodes without imploding. Besides the lack of a clean desire line, the subject of hollow suburban existence will make it extremely difficult for the writers to develop the show over the long term without beating a spiritually dead horse. In the meantime, I'm going to sit back and enjoy some great dramatic writing, and nowadays TV is the only place you'll find it."
"The central character in this show is a deeply damaged man called Don. He has a strong survival instinct, but he's incapable of loving or even trusting. He is running scared. He compensates for his insecurity and emptiness by pursuing primal things that soothing his ego. He has to feel that he's in control, even though he's living on the edge. He tries to be the ""Alpha Male"" conquering all around him. In reality, he is a juggler about to drop all the balls.

The others in this show are complex human beings whose characters dictate how their lives evolve and ultimately end up.

One interesting character that you follow throughout the series is Peggy. She enters the world of advertising as a total innocent, but as the show progresses, you'll see her become a worldly and powerful business woman.

The show is full of examples of the attitudes and mindset of the 1960s. The type writer was designed ""so even a woman can learn how to use it"". Everybody smokes, a lot. It's ok for kids to play with plastic bags over their heads. Women are treated in a way that would surely be considered sexual harassment in today's world. These unacceptable things jump out at you and startle you, and give you a flavor of that era.

The show was a hit for a reason. It's very good!"
"I also am utterly bemused to see so many negative comments on this show. I haven't taken to a TV drama so much since 'Our Friends in the North' (UK only I think) For those who seem to think the show is about pointing out the improved morals of the 21st century, or don't catch the story lines as being evolved enough, or think the characters shallow - I'm afraid you're missing the (beautifully painted) picture completely.

Mad Men oozes. It oozes class, style, sophistication, cinematic production, dreaminess and the wow factor. It seeps into your mind. It doesn't leave you alone, lingering around the corners of your mind for hours afterwards.

As a bonus (as if all this wasn't enough) you've got Don Draper (Jon Hamm). If there's a better cast character, being better acted elsewhere on television in the 21st century then I missed it. The fact that Don is also, or used to be Dick, just adds to the dreaminess.

It's gorgeous, just enjoy."
"The story line is very attractive. A group of fearless people that enjoy what they do and are really good at it. Stories that grow and develop, even with the smallest details including secrets, flaws, huge screw-ups which makes the characters very realistic and easy for the viewer to feel related to. But...series deserved a better ending. Last season feels forced, like if the producer run out of budget last minute and they needed to close the show early. Overall the series is one of those you love watching like a soap. Not really one of those that you just can´t wait for them to release the next episode, but still you do want to know what happens next. But the ending, it´s just not fare AT ALL with the all of the efforts made to create characters that got to you. I think the directors thought the ending was closer to life, than to give them a spectacular ending or a sounding close....whatever the thoughts they may have had, personally, they just screw 7 seasons with those final episodes."
"I first started to watch Mad Men when it was in its fifth season or so. I gave up in the second or third season because I didn't find it particularly interesting or engaging. Now that the entire series is on Netflix I decided to try again and watch the whole thing no matter what. My initial take on the show hasn't changed.

Having worked on several, I recognize a soap when I see one. People are so dazzled by the show being set in the 60's and the effects it has on set design, costume and hairstyle. And the setting is fun, with people smoking everywhere and office workers drinking like sailors on shore leave. But once the novelty wears off, the storylines are straight out of soap operas and the only thing more flat than the characters is the dialogue. And despite the show's attempt to be racy with its many, many sex scenes, in the end it's very chaste since it's on basic cable. Not a female nipple in sight, with blankets being pulled up to the armpits one split second post coitus and one swear word per show or season. Clutch the pearls and get the smelling salts.

The show is obsessed with Jews for obvious reasons, but it gets pretty old after a while. What else have you got? For a show trying so hard to be progressive, I find it somewhat amusing that the only religious and ethnic minorities which Hollywood (not only this show) deems worthy of attention are Jews and blacks. Perhaps it's because of the era the show is set in, but most likely not.

Don Draper has got to be one of the least interesting main characters in television. Having other characters commenting on how mysterious he is doesn't make him an interesting character. Forget for a minute how dashing Jon Hamm is playing him: Aside from screwing every woman who enters his field of vision and being afraid of his (not so terribly engaging) secret to come out, what does Don Draper want? After watching 92 episodes I still can't answer this basic question.

Evident from the plot point about his contract, it's clear he doesn't want to be tied down. So why did he choose to get married? And twice at that. In fact, why does he choose to work in advertising? He seems to enjoy neither his work nor his marriage(s). He just sort of trundles along sticking his weiner into any woman who happens to cross his path. I don't think there's anything wrong with Hamm's portrayal. It's just that he's given very little to work with. One character says the following to Don in the last season: ""You don't have any character, you're just handsome!"". I'm sure it was meant as a tongue in cheek joke by Weiner et al, but it accidentally summed up Don Draper to me. He's meaningless.

But singling out Don is unfair, most of the characters are one note. The acting is for the most part serviceable, with some notable exceptions. Vincent Kartheiser playing Pete is one example. It's not that I don't like the character, it's just that not a single moment (especially in the latter seasons) rings true.

But the prime example has got to be January Jones as Betty. I'm sorry to be piling on, because she has already gotten a lot of flak, but this is possibly the stiffest acting I have seen in a high budget project. She certainly looks the part, being a dead ringer for Grace Kelly, but every single line reading comes off as her reading from the phone book. But wait, it gets worse. In a move of blatant nepotism Matthew Weiner's son is cast as Glen, a boy with a dead-eyed thousand yard stare and all the likeability and charm of a serial rapist who crosses paths with the Draper household. The scenes he shares with Betty (of which there are many) are nothing but torture. One got cast because of her looks, the other because of his DNA, and neither one could act their way out of a paper bag."
"Just finished the finale. My husband & I watched this over the last few months. I felt like I was reading a book. Character development, story lines, sets, period pieces, costume & design, acting, writing, all top notch. I will miss this show. I may have to rewatch again some time! So good."
"Set in the changing world of advertising in the 1960s this series is centred on the employees of one agency as they work to gain new contracts and maintain the ones they have and deal with take-overs and buy-outs. There are many major characters but most important is Don Draper; a man with the magic touch in his business who is far from perfect; he cheats on his wife, drinks rather too much and has a secret that could get him in a lot of trouble if it came to light. We also have Peggy Olsen; a secretary who quickly becomes the only woman on the creative team; office manager Joan Harris; the ambitious Pete Campbell and Roger Sterling, the somewhat amoral partner with an eye for the ladies. The series doesn't only follow the characters at work; we see their home lives; Don's family, particularly his wife Betty and daughter Sally, are as important as his colleagues.

If you are looking for action and expect stuff to happen all the time this might not be for you; but if you want a great character led drama that really captures the feel of the era in which it is set then this might be just what you are looking for. The characters might not be the most likeable but their flaws make them feel real. The ongoing story nicely incorporates the news stories that would affect the national consciousness at the time as well as the changing attitudes to race and sexuality. The cast is superlative; most obviously John Hamm who is great as Don but Elisabeth Moss, Christina Hendricks, Vincent Kartheiser, January Jones and John Slattery whose characters stand out. Kiernan Shipka deserves separate mention as she does a great job as Sally; a role she started when she was about six years old. The series provides plenty of drama but also a good number of laughs and one gory shock involving a lawnmower and a foot! Overall I would definitely recommend this superior series."
"This is truly one of the best drama series in the history of television as it has everything a drama should have: great characters and ensemble cast, superb writing, mind blowing sets and costumes. It's a character driven story that follows Don Draper and the people around him for ten years from 1960 to 1970 and the writing in these 7 seasons have been interesting and enjoyable to follow. Matthew Veiner created a piece of art with his unique and spectacular writing, mixing fiction with non fiction made him get freedom and with that he could create the many characters that the show has to offer and they are all realistic and believable characters, it's some of the best characters in a show that I've seen.

How Matthew Veiner and his crew have recreated New York in its 60's have been something incredible to see as it's detailed from the clothes that the people wear to how they act and the whole world has a feeling that is hard to capture but the crew behind Mad Men succeeded. So what are you in for if you choose to watch this piece of art, more than one of the best drama's in TV history you get to see the fine acting of the whole ensemble cast and mostly Jon Hamm, the man that plays Don Draper, everyone did incredible and emmy worthy performances."
"I must admit I'm more likely to be shocked how many users find this drama dull.I remember the night I had the chance to gaze at one of episodes for couple of minutes.Betty posing for a coke ad didn't seem charming or appealing to me at all, I changed the channel...

Long after the series won the Emmies, beautiful tunes of David Carnobora buzzed into my ear via commercials and I thought I might have to get the complete DVD.

HBO absolutely made their worst business move maybe in their history by dissing this show.Cos Made Men is clever, cool, charismatic, sexy but more over it's targeting the audience HBO has created over years.Not random Americans who switch between Idol, a weirdo doctors unpleasant patients who will recover thanks to him or ugly police officers digging a carpet for a strand to discover a guy who you already know committed a homicide.

OK lemme tell you about why I adore this show.Mad Men is ultimately written by people who has a giant caliber of creativity and talent.This show demands the audience to be careful, tedious, curious about what they are watching.This show is not to be figured out in a single episode.After I completed season one I had some feeling towards what Weiner had in his mind while pitching the series to channel executives.Do not let the name fool you, Mad Men is not about ad- business or copywriters, show merely talks about ads, even when they are doing an ad.It is about America, how America transferred itself -and the world which depended on it- through out the sixties.In which manners capitalism can market itself with big lies.

By showing us the differences between 60's and 2000's series easily projects ideas about our time during a past decade.Characters in the show are so real, then I mean not just protagonist Don Draper, every other big, tiny or one time characters gets his/her time on screen and therefore show builds up a magnificent universe which you believe it exits and roam safely.Mad Men is not show yelling or speaking out loud, it politely whispers...We the audience witness a group of peoples lives in NYC, Matthew Weiner cleverly puts mile stone political, social events of USA balanced with everyday life of people as well, balanced fastidiously.The one biggest disappointing down side of Mad Men is that there are almost zero on-location shootings.We never get to see the - city- or anything else.This gives the feeling of being locked in sometimes for the viewer.Cast is totally cool and sexy with their superb retro wardrobe.Jon Hamm is the perfect choice for a lead, January Jones is so sexy that you can't get her out of your mind.Smokey, brownish production design is sweet and elegant.Also soundtrack selecting is so much joyful.

I can't say Mad Men is an easy chew.You have to be patient also alert.As I sad you can get a clear feeling only after watching an entire season.Do you want to watch the same TV shows over seasons or want some fun, intelligent brain gymnastics ? The codes of Mad Men are there to decode for your own sake.Do not miss it..."
"Mad Men is the kind of show you want to watch if you are having doubts of your career and life.

The characters and perfectly developed and none of them fall flat. The show is real and crude and portrays many aspects of the professional and personal life of a person.

Some episodes are flat and some scenes are not necessary but this show is something to look at."
"When I saw the 8.5, I had to comment on why it wasn't a 10. Holy crap! Come on people! Talk about a series that sucked us in and had us always wanting more!!! Well, it as a 10 in my book."
"Don is broken. But in the outside he's unbreakable.

A slow burn with great story telling and cinematography leads to a top 5 show of all time.

The period piece depicts the pure madness of New York and ad agencies where the winner decides how the consumer will perceive a brand. The product doesn't matter it's the message and the way something is perceived that matters. Not much has changed since then.

Love, war, violence, money, hate and greed all heavy present themes.

Less words are better says Madmen writers. Quiet and subtle moments make the biggest impacts all set alongside the strong but tormented Don.

Superior casting, writing and set results in a show for the ages that stands the test of the times."
"I don't watch TV drama usually, with rare exceptions: The Sopranos (especially the early seasons) and Entourage, if that counts. Mad Men is one of the most original, refreshingly dark and complex shows I've ever seen on TV. Despite its potential for soap opera story lines, it consistently transcends expectations and explores fascinating characters and a radically changing social environment in a beautifully shot, artfully designed and, above all, excellently acted manner. After watching virtually no TV recently (less than three hours per week), my wife and I have been hooked all week, catching up on every episode - although we have yet to see the first, which a technical glitch in our On Demand service is holding tantalizingly out of reach. I loved Todd Haynes' Far From Heaven, and this is like a generously extended - and in some respects even more fascinating - adjunct to that. Madison Avenue is the perfect prism through which to view the early 1960s, and Mad Men, with its post-noir, Nixon/JFK/beatnik/martini melange, is a hugely enjoyable, finely measured cocktail that leaves just the right taste in the mouth."
"I wanted to watch Mad Men as it was recommended in a lot of websites on articles along the lines of: ""Shows you should binge watch"" The IMDb rating of 8.7 proved to further bolster that point.

The problem with Mad Men is not necessarily the plot line is bad and the events that take place in the story are uncalled for and are characterised by bad writing -- it's because not a lot happens. And I really want to emphasise on that. Nothing happens. I found that watching it was just watching a cinematic recording of some guys in an advertising agency. It wasn't like a TV show where I was like, ""Cool! That would be memorable if that happened in real life!"" There was nothing exciting or anything that at least somewhat kept me on the edge of my seat whilst viewing it. After each episode, I felt no desire to watch the next one. It was just dull and mundane.

A positive for the show, I'd like to point out, is the atmosphere and the 'feel' for 1960's NYC. It isn't too much and it isn't too little. It felt real. The costume designs, the environment. They were all convincing.

I stopped watching Mad Men due to it's dull and mundane plot line at S03E02. I didn't get through the first two seasons by the story, like I should have, I got through them by escaping into the cool atmosphere Mad Men offered.

Overall, not a bad show but not a good one either. I wouldn't recommend it.

IMDb RATING: 6/10 - OKAY"
"... because producers seem to think that just because they portray this stylish era, they can be sloppy about the plot. One of the most frustrating things I found is that many interesting plot threads are started and are never followed up upon later (or just not enough). A lot of scenes could be just easily left out since they don't contribute to the understanding of the characters or the plot (seriously, do we really need to see Don taking a long walk across the office or smoking leisurely at a restaurant with nothing else going on?). Instead, producers could spend more time on good dialogs, because the dialogs in this show are trite for the most part.

In my opinion, most people give it good ratings because either they like the era, or because it got so much attention from the media. Or they suspect that there's more to this show than they see, and maybe they just ""don't get it"". I only watched it because I heard about it on NPR. I watched the whole first season and two episodes from the second season. Each episode left me with a hollow feeling: ""And this is it?"" I'm not going to waste any more of my time on this over-hyped show."
"This unique series from AMC needs a few qualifiers. The first is, you can't watch just one episode from the middle of a season and form an opinion about it. Taken out of context, an individual episode will seem mildly interesting for the costumes and hairstyles, but for most viewers, it will be slow and dull entertainment.

The beauty of ""Mad Men"" lies in what's under the surface, the subtext, and that can only be appreciated by watching the entire series, starting at the beginning.

""Mad Men"" starts in 1960. The period has been duplicated with 99.99% accuracy. The missing 0.1% is that a) though IBM Selectric typewriters are shown in 1960, they weren't introduced until 1961; and b) Don Draper (Jon Hamm) in 1962 is 36 years old, which leads one to wonder why he was in Korea and not WWII. There's a third thing from season 3 that I won't mention right now. The hair, the clothes, the smoking, the drinking, the littering, the references, having Jean Shrimpton in an ad, the products - Mohawk Airlines, Utz, etc., the huge copy machine, the Catholics, the Latin Mass, the rampant sexism, the kids in front of the TV, the programs - phenomenal. When the firm is called in to work on a Sunday, and a priest stops by Peggy's (Elizabeth Moss) house, her mother says she's sick. Why? Catholics aren't supposed to work on Sunday. I love it.

The characters inside and out of Sterling and Cooper: There's the handsome, mysterious, conflicted and private Don Draper (Jon Hamm) who's a brilliant ad man and loyal to his clients to boot; his Grace Kelly-ish wife (January Jones) who smokes, drinks wine, and goes to a psychiatrist; Peggy, a gal with a big secret and a big brain, who is trying to fit into a man's world; Sterling (John Slattery, who auditioned for his role 9 times), full of wit, heart problems, and women; Cooper (Robert Morse), old but shrewd; Joan (Christina Hendricks), the va-va-va voom secretarial supervisor; the wormy Pete Campbell (Vincent Kartheiser); the closeted Salvatore Romano (Bryan Batt), and many others, all interesting and all fleshed out.

Some of the lesser characters ""put on"" the '60s style and don't inhabit their characters. But you won't find that in the major actors. Hamm is extremely internalized and may seem like he's not doing much, but when Don Draper blows a fuse, you know he's coming from a real place. It's a subtly powerful characterization. Slattery is great, as is Batt, Kartheiser, Morse and the rest of the ad men. Moss is also giving a deeply internalized performance - the character of Peggy is hard to read, as she should be. January Jones does a marvelous job as Don's unpredictable and unhappy wife, and she's stunningly beautiful to boot.

I saw one episode from season 2 in August and wasn't impressed. When I started watching the Netflix disks at a friend's house, I couldn't stop. Mad Men has a unique power all its own. It's not easily appreciated; it's not for people who want something obvious that they don't have to think about. It's for people who want to become completely lost in this world and absorbed in its characters. It's also a trip down memory lane for those of us who remember the '60s. Like the agency of Sterling and Cooper, ""Mad Men"" is not for everybody. However, it's definitely for me, and I'm addicted."
"A lot of people don't remember that The Flintstones was the first prime time cartoon series, and what a success it was.

I think the fact that it was written for prime time, with writing meant to appeal to old and young alike, is why the series holds up so well into these times. Of course, it was also based on the solid foundation of copying The Honeymooners, and that didn't hurt either.

I learned a lot of lessons from the Flintstones. I don't have misunderstandings with my friends, and I don't sneak out to do things my wife doesn't know about. LOL I also buy dogs that are too small to knock me down when I get home.

Almost every story is a little morality play with a lesson, large or small learned. Fred is obviously not a character to pattern your life after, and this is another important lesson.

Lessons aside, the shows are uniformly amusing, and the clever turns of names into stone age words, and modern conveniences into useful animals, is always clever and will bring chuckles when first you see them."
"Hey have a grand old time remember as a kid watching this some and from time to time still catch an episode of this in syndication. The cartoon ""The Flintstones"" was colorful plus it had a catchy theme song and most segments and things that the characters did was just downright funny and outrageous. As it was a mix of two modern day stone age families the flintstones and rubbles lead by Fred and Barney respectively. And they would try to do modern things in the stone age! The laughs and animals featured were funny as this cartoon is still remembered even as new generations discover it. So watch it and have a grand old time!"
"""The Flintstones"" is a classic cartoon. As a kid I had no idea that the show had been off the air for twenty years before I began watching it. I couldn't get enough of the exploits of Fred, Wilma, Barney, Betty, and later, Bamm-Bamm. They made prehistoric times look like real fun. It seems that all you needed was a little ingenuity and you could have everything that we had in the '80s.

Later I found out that Fred Flintstone (voiced by Alan Reed) was a bit of a mimicry of Jackie Gleason in ""The Honeymooners."" None of that was relevant to me as I watched Hanna-Barbera Productions classics such as ""The Flintstones,"" ""The Jetsons,"" and ""Scooby-Doo."""
"""The Flintstones"" was so dead-on satirical in its view of a prehistoric suburban world that I don't really understand it when people tell me they liked ""The Jetsons"" better. There's nobody I can relate to on ""The Jetsons"", no character who exudes any warmth or wit. The characters here (Fred, Barney, Wilma, Betty, Dino, Pebbles, Bamm-Bamm, Mr. Slate, Mrs. Slaghoople, etc.) have expressions and personalities which are instantly recognizable to an audience. They're a very funny bunch, and they often find each other greatly amusing as well (each character has a sense of humor--and their friendships really do seem like a bond). I don't know why the Hanna-Barbera team weren't able to duplicate the quality of this show in terms of its writing and voice-casting (perhaps it was all a fluke?), but ""The Flintstones"" has it all: great writing and voices which bring one-dimensional drawings to life, terrific plots, fantastic music by Hoyt Curtin. Not a kiddie show...not a sitcom...not a child-pacifier. ""The Flintstones"" is a minor miracle."
"It's sad how I can only find this show on Boomerang now. I have to hurry up and purchase the DVD before there is no more. I remember my mother saying that they still air the show, so there is no need to by the DVD. Now what she said is incorrect.

This show was a very great show to watch, along with the Jetsons. I remember having a fake car toy that I rode and pretend I was Fred Flintstone. This show had over 50 years of making kids love it. It's not too late. The Flintstones should air for another fifty, or hundred. There is no need to cancel it.

I recommend you to watch this show before it stops airing. It used to be one of the best shows on television."
"This is definitely the show that put Hanna-Barbera studios on the map. After years of producing primarily cartoons for children (Yogi Bear, Huckleberry Hound et ala.), this really became the first cartoon show that was geared for adults, though there still is enough to keep children interested. Fred, Wilma, Barney and Betty are all people everyone can relate to even though the show is set in the stone age. And even though I feel that in most cases the introduction of cute kids ruins a show, the introduction of Pebbles and Bamm Bamm helped to show that beneath his gruff exterior Fred was a big teddy bear. However, I do agree that when Gazoo was introduced was when the show's quality began to go down hill. Thankfully, he was never included in any of the subsequent incarnations of the ""modern stone age family""."
"For me - TV's ""The Flintstones"" is one of those 2-D animated series from the early 1960s that was only marginally entertaining, at best.

Yes. There was some very cute and clever thought put into the stone-age setting of the town of Bedrock. But, unfortunately, the unwelcome element of family soap opera crept into way too many of the episodes more often than I could honestly appreciate.

(*Trivia Note*) - ""The Flintstones"" was one of the most successful animated TV series to run during prime-time broadcasting."
"I don't care how much flack I'm going to get for this, but I'm 44 years old, and I STILL think this is the best TV show of all time! All through my school years it was broadcast every day on a local TV station at noon, and at noon every kid in town would run home, gobble down their lunches, and watch. I must have seen every episode at least 100 times, if not more. And long after I got out of school I continued the ritual. If anything, I appreciate it more now that I'm older. There was so much that resonated. The chemistry between Fred and Barney couldn't be beat. Best friends through thick and thin. Even tho they'd drive each other crazy at times, when the chips were down they'd walk thru fire for each other. I could give a million reasons why I love this show. This show is one of my happiest childhood memories, and I know I'll NEVER tire of it. Thank you Hanna and Barbera."
I'm aware that it broke several tv boundaries but personally I think it's ok. The jokes are dated and in some cases offensive by today's standards but there're still some funny jokes that get a laugh. The characters don't need much of an introduction as they're well known. In fact you probably know them due to Fruity or Cocoa Pebbles. I don't have much to say other than if you like old cartoons give this one a go.
"I grew up on shows like Scooby Doo and Tom Jerry and this is no exception. I love the Flintstones:- it is funny and incredibly smart, and at 17 I can still watch it and there is very seldom a dull moment. What makes it great? Well, the detailed and colourful animation contributes hugely. Also the theme tune, has to be one of the most catchy theme tunes on any animated TV show. Then there's the humour, the whole show is constantly funny and is guaranteed to have you chuckling away. Finally we have the characters. Fred is one zany cartoon, and Alan Reed was the perfect choice for him. Another hilarious character, perhaps even more so than Fred is Barney, who is quite goofy yet completely lovable. Who'd better to voice him than the immortal Mel Blanc? Then we have Wilma, who is a great sexy female character and wonderfully voiced by Jean Vader Pyl. Plus the voluptuous Betty, voiced to perfection by Bea Benaderet. The writing constantly is incredibly witty, sharp and smart, the story lines are outstanding and the supporting characters namely the hilarious Mr Slate and cute as a button Pearl are just as great. All in all, I loved this when I was a kid, and as a near-adult I still love it. Adults will enjoy it as well as kids. 10/10 Bethany Cox"
"The Flintstones is a show that depicts life during the Stone Age. The show focuses around one family, the Flintstones. Fred is the husband that works at a quarry, Wilma is his wife, who is a homemaker. Dino, their dinosaur pet, and Pebbles, the Flintstone baby that was added during the series. Their neighbors were the Rubbles: Barney, Fred's friend that works at the quarry with him, Betty, Wilma's friend and Barney's wife, and Bamm-Bamm, their strong son that the Rubbles adopted.

This was one of the best shows and it still is. It was really funny, especially the way they use animals as devices like vacuum cleaner, garbage disposal, etc. It had a great plot, great characters and voice actors, and it is original. This show is a classic, too. Overall, a classic superb show.This was one of my favorite shows when I was a kid, I used to watch it all the time, then later when I discovered Cartoon Network, I got to watch it more often, but now I watch it on Boomerang and on DVD.

Each season offered something special and I know of this series having so many specials and movies that I can't keep track. While the animation on the show was not too impressive, the animation on the specials and movies was great. But sometimes it is simple animation to make a great show, I don't think I would like this show as much if it had better animation in place of the animation it had when it was made, One episode that confuses me however is the episode ""The Snorkasaurus Hunter"" While it explains how Dino came, he was really smart in that one and spoke, I wish I knew why that changed but oh well.

I like many of the episodes that feature mainly Fred and Barney together because for me it had the most laughs.

I loved every episode, every special, and every movie of this great series from the sixties and hope some day they all come out on DVD so I can have the whole bunch. And even after all that, The Flintstones have continued to go on with their popular cereal commercials ""Fruity and Cocoa Pebbles"" with while about 30 seconds, some nice laughs.

I would recommend this show to many kids and many adults who love humor and a spin on a interesting vision of the past, It makes you think if the Stone Age really was modern, how life would be for you back then."
"Blow-hard. Obnoxious. Putz. These are just a few adjectives that accurately describe the protagonist of this sit-""com"". The ""com"" being in quotations because the comedic value of this show is little to none.

The animation is just basic, and that is being kind. Looping backgrounds and characters with their heads on backwards abound. Cavemen? I think not! They are rubber-necks!

Back to the simpleton that is the main character... Fred Flintstone is the personification of all that is wrong with boomers. Loud-mouth, know-it-all and brashly strutting around proudly in his ignorance. With this being the mentality that boomers find so funny and entertaining, is it any wonder the world is in such a poor state today?

One only needs to watch a single episode to see how terrible it is. Jokes don't land, so they need to add a laugh track to point them out. Simply a cover for any imbecile that chooses to watch this drivel.

Would give 0/10 if possible. Do not watch this show or your IQ will be reduced to that of a brontosaurus burger after passing through Fred's colon."
"THE FLINTSTONES hold a special place in my memory, as I'm sure they do for many people the world over. The series started in Britain in 1960, the year I had my very first job - babysitting for a neighbor. I was just 15. The two kids were total brats, screaming, spoilt, mashed potato slam-dunked over the wallpaper...but I didn't care, I was watching Fred and Barney live out there lives of near-perfection in a world that was starting to move away from near perfection! ""Yabba Dabba Doo"" must surely be one of the most recognizable cries on earth - WHO would not know its origins from 4 to 90?

The success of this animated icon probably lies in the simplicity of the Flintstone and Rubble clans. Everyone on this planet is part Fred, Barney, Betty or Wilmer at some time in their lives. Events depicted in each and every episode were things that everyone can, did (and will continue) to identify with. They are Mr and Mrs Average and if we all lived our lives and never achieved anything more than the Flintstones we could justifiably be happy. The show supported family values, decency, togetherness, love, friendship, clean living, laughter and it was environmentally aware, socially responsible and able STILL to reach children.

The lives of everyone in the Western World would have been that much poorer had it not been for THE FLINTSTONES. I can't say as much for the two appalling movie spin-offs!"
"After the original series left the air in 1966, there have been a lot of inferior remakes and adulterations in other venues. Nothing compares with the original. People have compared this to the Honeymooners. Not so. The Honeymooners was a simple situation comedy. Except for the early episodes, Fred and Wilma didn't bicker much. The show was busy making subtle and not so subtle satiric points.

In one episode, they poked fun of ratings, unrealistic TV shows, placement of station breaks and people who live vicariously through television.

In, the Beauty Contest, Fred and Barney waxed nostalgic over when they were single and longed to hear a woman's voice. Later, there were many hilarious exchanges. The show didn't give you what you expected. Sometimes an overdone point was hysterically funny. Betty: I don't feel like watching television. Barney: But you HAVE to watch television, Betty. Some lines of dialogue are for the ages BARNEY: Did you ever start up a gangplank and have a sudden feeling there was no ship?

Among stellar characters, we must mention Verna Felton's portrayal of Wilma's mother. She was the worst mother-in-law in the world. (I must point out that Wilma's maiden name is Pebble. Later writers forgot that and gave her the name Slaghoople. Thus are errors perpetuated.) At turns the show could be warm, mature, serious, poignant and hysterically funny because of the subtlety with which certain things were done. Every week was an incredible adventure. I was there when it began. It was my favorite show then. It still is.

I should also mention the great Alan Reed, the quintessential everyman, incomparable Mel Blanc and real life best friends Jean Vander Pyl and Bea Benaderet playing best friends and wives Wilma Flintstone and Betty Rubble.

I could mention Paula Winslowe's portrayal of Greta Gravel in an episode with an important message about marriage. I'm sure you get the picture. I could go on and on, but I won't."
"There were two major turning points in ""The Flintstones"" six-year run. The first was the introduction of the characters of Pebbles (at the end of Season 3) and Bamm-Bamm (beginning of Season 4). The second was when the wonderful Bea Benaderet left the show at the end of Season 4. She made the character of Betty Rubble a real person and not just ""the second wife"". Her replacement for the last 2 seasons was not in the same league. But, getting back to the first change. Part of what made the show special was the notion of an animated sit-com with scripts geared for adults. Episodes involving suspicion of infidelity and Fred's gambling addiction show that children were not the target audience. After the introduction of the children the show changed. There were still great episodes (my favorite ""A Haunted House is Not a Home"" is from Season 5) but also episodes made to appeal to children. (Episodes such as ""Superstone"" and ""Dripper"" are almost unwatchable to anyone over 12.) And when you start introducing characters based on other sit-coms (The Hatrocks, The Gruesoms) it's a sign you're running out of ideas. Still, during the first 3 seasons nearly every episode was wonderful. One thing I love to listen for--when the four lead voice actors appear doing ""additional voices"". Alan Reed did it occassionally. The other three in nearly every episode. Trying to spot them is fun. BTW Wilma's Mother didn't have a name during her early appearances. It's only in Season 4 that we hear Betty call her ""Mrs. Slaghoople"". Where they got the name ""Pearl"" I don't know as she's never called that."
This is a great animation series for all viewers to watch and enjoy. The crew did an alright job in creating this animation series. The storyline of the series might have been simple but it worked. The cast selection was alright. They brilliantly committed to the storyline all the way throughout the series. This animation series reveals to viewers a glimpse of what history was like for the world. History has the power to help everyone look and prepare for the future. If everyone works together as a team. It is a possibility that the world of today can become a better and safe place. This is a fine animation series for everyone to watch.
"The Flintstones was the cartoon to begin all cartoons. Head of Household (or so he thought) Fred Flintsone, his wife Wilma (what a woman's libber for the stone age!), their child Pebbles...and their very close neighbors and friends Barney (Fred's hanging buddy and partner in crime), Betty (Wilma's partner in crime!)and adopted son Bam-Bam (what a concept!), the dead end job with the egotistical boss (Mr. Slate...of late!)all set back in the 'stone age'...which I always thought was a personal Hanna Barbera joke due to many of Fred's views and the things that went on around his life...well, this cartoon is the grand-daddy of all cartoons.

As I remember correctly, The Flintstones was patterned after the live show ""The Honeymooners"". But a cartoon...can do more than human actors can! And in watching the Flintstones, it was imagination beyond belief - Stone Aged Dinosaurs tamed and used as building machinery, pelicans used to mix concrete, Fred smacking Barney so many times he should be in a hospital, cars run by foot power and also your feet as the breaks against the hard stone ground...OF COURSE THIS IS NOT REAL LIFE! It's cartoons, humor...fun. Remember that?

Loved this cartoon to death...what long lasting images, staying power and I can watch it 1,000,000 and not tire of it. Consequently, I can watch it 1,000,000 times and not develop a violent streak in my body either. (The Flintstone was also one of the first cartoons to be placed on the ""violent cartoons"" list...and now the smoking and drinking lists as well.) It's a piece of childhood (and now adult) fantasy...nostalgic...loads of fun and quite a look back at the foundation that runs through many cartoons today. Remember: Copying is the best form of flattery..and The Flintsones have been flattered...a lot."
"After the amazing series put forth by Disney, Warner Brothers and even Hanna-Barbera (mainly for Tom and Jerry) which revolutionized the cartoon industry, mainstream cartoons for the most part took a huge step backwards. The Flinstones is one of the earliest cartoons which showcased this very clearly.

You know what's the best thing about cartoons? They can be funny, hilarious, unpredictable wacky or whatever you want to call them. They can defy a lot of real life rules much easier than in movies. That's what makes cartoons so great. No matter how advanced technology gets and no matter how sophisticated film making gets, cartoons will always have the upper hand in terms of making the impossible possible. When cartoons started a whole new world of possibilities opened which was experimented with very finely on classics like Tom And Jerry, Bugs Bunny, Mickey Mouse etc. However, when the 20th century was more than halfway over, cartoons like this one came into existence and basically stripped away all that made cartoons fun to watch.

I do commend the cartoon for trying something different. Depicting a stone age family living modernly (well, for the 60s anyway) was something that caught the eyes of many viewers. But other than that, there's nothing redeemable about this highly praised cartoon. The jokes are very very bland, the laugh track just makes them more annoying, the advantage the creators had as they were making a cartoon and not a sitcom, has not been utilized much at all. The characters are just boring. The animation is very lazy compared to the cartoons of the 40s, even compared to some cartoons from the 20s. The story is insanely predictable and I repeat, the cartoon is not funny in any way, shape or form. Though some of the jokes involving usage of dinosaurs and other old animals are *kind* of amusing, even they are not presented in a fashion that could actually be humorous. Oh, and the 'catchphrases' are just dumb.

You'd think the creators would've learned something from the past cartoons from the classic 40s era and would've tried to analyze what works and what doesn't. Instead they made a pile of drivel which made some of the oldest Warner Bros. shorts seem like masterpieces. This is also one of the cartoons which bred the coming of similar atrocities in the 60s and 70s e.g The Jetsons, Yogi Bear, Scooby Doo (though it had some potential), 60s Tom and Jerry, Top Cat, Hair Bear Bunch etc. Mainstream cartoons did not progress at all after this avalanche till the early 90s.

In the end all I shall say is .... Yabba Dabba snoooooooore....."
"""The Flintstones"" to me is indeed one of the greatest cartoons that was produced by Hanna-Barbera. For those who aren't familiar with this show (which I'll be shocked with if there are.) The shows premise is about a blue collar, dino crane operator in Fred Flintstone, who in each episode had a wacky situation along with his wife Wilma, and his neighbors Barney and Betty Rubble. The show is basically ""The Honeymooners"" except it's animated. The show also had an adult style (not porno) to it, but it was light. However, there were some things that occured that affected the show...

First off, the birth of Pebbles. Don't get me wrong, I had nothing against Pebbles, or Bam-Bamm the world's strongest baby that the Rubbles adopted, I think their appearances to the show hurt it since the show was originally a adult oriented show. What I'm saying is that now with kids on the show, it wasn't as adult oriented. The show was losing ground then, but that moment can't top the moment when the Great Gazoo came in. This was when the show really lost it. All of the life that ""The Flinstones"" had left was sucked dry when Great Gazoo came in. He ruined the show, and finished what was left of it off, and left it for dead basically. Sadly the show left the airwaves in 1966, but Hanna-Barbera began to beat the show to the ground in the 1970's with debacles like ""The Pebbles and Bam-Bamm Show"" (Possibly the WORST Hanna-Barbera spinoff show ever!), and the shows where Fred and Barney met the Thing, and that blob called ""The Shmoo"" (Both of these shows were CRAP!!!) were just bad. However, the original show itself is still great after 40+ years.

This show overall gets a 10/10 for the Pre-Pebbles birth episodes, a 5/10 for the Post Pebbles birth episodes, and a whomping 0/10 for the awful Great Gazoo episodes (thought there weren't a lot)."
"Recently while I was at the library, I looked up the newspaper from the day I was born on microfilm. In the entertainment section, there was a review of a TV show about an animated ""Modern Stone-Age Family"". Yes, folks, I was born at roughly the same time as THE FLINTSTONES! It was a very unique show, showing how some of the modern gadgets of today (or the ""today"" of 1960)were actually around in caveman times (phonographs, cameras, intercoms, hot water heaters). But, let's give credit where it is due: There would really have been no FLINTSTONES if there hadn't been THE HONEYMOONERS. Both shows dealt with a big, loudmouth type with a goofy friend who were in a battle of the sexes with their wives. The loudmouth worked at a job that involved a big piece of machinery (Ralph Kramden drove a bus; Fred Flintstone operated a dino-steam shovel), was at odds with his boss, didn't get along with his mother-in-law, belonged to a lodge named after a mammal, always had a get-rich-quick scheme and liked to go bowling and shoot pool. Alan Reed, the voice of Fred Flinstone, even used to do vocal stand-in work for Jackie Gleason. Oddly enough, though the show is popular with children, I don't think it was aimed squarely at kids. In fact, I think a lot of it would go over most children's heads. One episode in particular I didn't understand as a child, but now has me kind of stunned when I think back at it: Wilma has a recipe for gravelberry pie. Fred tries to market it and gets a factory to buy him out. Later, Fred tries to raise the price of the pies and tells the factory owner to take it or leave. ""I'm leaving it."" the owner tells Fred, ""What am I going to do with all of these pies?"" Fred asks, ""Well, you can take those pies and . . ."" At that moment, the factory whistle goes off and drowns out what the man has to say. ""Excuse me,"" Fred says meekly, ""That whistle was making too much noise. What did you say I could do with those pies again?"" Needless to say, when I got older and saw that episode, my eyebrows were raised. I shudder to think what would be done with that moment in this day and age."
"I watched this baby from its Birth in 1960. In a period of Amazing Sit Coms there was None Better! Excellent Voice performers including my personal All Time Favorite, Bea Benaderet/Betty Rubble from both Classic Radio and TV like Burns and Allen and The Beverly Hillbillies and of course Petticoat Junction where she was the star Kate Bradley. Watching it in 2021, it is better than any new show on tv today!!!"
"The Flintstones is a show that I grew up with. Before re-watching this at the age of 25, I had vague memories of certain episodes that I wanted to see again. When I found a DVD box set, I decided to take the plunge and re-live my childhood. Boy oh boy was I in for a Yabba Dabba treat!

Set in the stone age, The Flintstones is a show that centres around the antics of Fred Flintstone and Barney Rubble, with their respective wives having to deal with the ensuing fallout. From dealing with a penny pushing boss to trying to win a gaming show on TV, this series truly captures what a ""modern stone age family"" goes through! Aside from the plot of each episode being relatable, the small details within episode also add a comedic element. Making everyday tools, such as TV remotes, garbage disposals and even showers have a stone age twist to explain how they work in such a time period is brilliant!

Aside from their plots, the episodes were greatly enhanced by what was going on in the background. The background music in between scenes has a great orchestra and are very iconic. Even the cheesy laughs in the background add an element of hilarity. You could really see the effort that was made into hand-drawing the scenes for these episodes, which is something that has been lost since computers have taken away this skill from modern cartoonists.

The series does however show its age in the respect of women in society. The wives are expected to stay at home to do chores and ensure dinner is on the table when their husband comes home. If not, you can see Fred get angry and proclaim that a woman's place is in the kitchen. I understand this is a reflection of the time it was made, but it may not be to everyone's taste. In my opinion, these jokes are still funny but not for their punchline, but for how outrageous they are!

All in all, The Flintstones is a true Hanna-Barbera classic. The episodes are all great and did not taint the sense of nostalgia I had before embarking on watching them."
"This show is one of my favourites and I get excited for every season but some seasons are quite disappointing , most are great though.

Season 1 (murder house) 9.2/10 One of the most entertaining and creepy seasons I have ever watched tate and violet were great characters and so was Jessica Lange's character this season was brilliant.

Season 2 (asylum) 9.3/10 Absolutely loved this season. A very weird season with aliens, the devil, a angel, and some very twisted nuns. I feel like the ending definitely could have been better but other than that this season really didn't disappoint.

Season 3 (coven) 9.1/10 Is a great season ! Tarissa farmiga and Evan peters really didn't disappoint. I loved every minute of this season and it is one of my favourites

Season 4 (freak show) 7.7/10 This season was a step down but still really entertaining Emma roberts character was a let down and I didn't like a lot of the characters. I did love the fact pepper returned and Finn witrocks performance was excellent. This season had one of the best endings but overall wasn't the best season

Season 5 (hotel) 8.4/10 I know a lot of people didn't enjoy this season but I found it really great. The first few episodes were a big let down but the rest was excellent. Evan peters character was really well acted and I really enjoyed lady gaga's character.

Season 6 (Roanoke) I honestly couldn't watch this season. I watched the first few episodes and it was a big disappointment.from what I've saw I'd give it a 5.0/10

Season 7 (cult) 7.9/10 There is a lot of controversy on this season but I thought it was great. The first 4 or 5 episodes aren't great but I really enjoyed the rest. Its got a crazy ending and in my opinion Evan peters deserved a Emmy for his performance as Kai

Season 8 (apocalypse) 9.1/10 Absolutely brilliant! The return of one of the best seasons, coven and murder house, and they handled it great unlike a lot of shows returning something would do. Evan peters character was a let down because it was a very average character and was only in a few episodes, except for his performance as tate Langton, this was one of the best seasons and didn't fail to entertain me. On of the most twisted endings this show has had

Season 9 (1984) 7.9/10 A very enjoyable season but did get a little boring they made most of the season 1 night. And Emma roberts character was extremely boring and generic. I was really disappointed Evan peters wasn't in this season. Montana's character was one of the best this show has had. And a very entertaining character was the night stalker. The rest were honestly pretty boring , but overall I did really like this season."
"The 9 stars are for the first 9 seasons.

American Horror Story was a brilliant show in the early years, and I've watched some seasons on repeat, especially Hotel.

Sarah Paulson was one of the most talented, dynamic actors consistently throughout all of the different narratives and characters.

I was not excited at all about Double Feature or NYC, and Delicate is just bad. It's awful. If I had never seen American Horror Story before and only watched Delicate, I would give it one star.

All good things must come to an end, and Ryan Murphy just didn't know when to stop. At least we'll always have Coven."
"American Horror Story is interesting, unique and has a clever way of twisting Americans and making one examine perception vs reality under the guise of horror. The better seasons were Season 1, and season 5 Hotel, and of course there are cool concepts in others including Freak Show. The last several seasons have not even attempted to mask their social message and political opinions and frankly it's getting old. We get it, move on. Many of us want good old fashioned story telling with more subtle messages, but that's not what we see. Many of the main cast have moved on, that we loved to see in different but predictable roles and that has dimmed the lustre. I would honour the roots of the show and go back to what worked. I must say the new American Horror STORIES is a bit more palatable and I enjoyed several of these episodes including Dollhouse, Facelift, Necro, and Game Over amongst others. This is a modern Twilight Zone!

American Horror Story writers- don't bank on cult following to have viewers continue watching - Perceiving as long as you have some gore and an iconic theme you can avoid good story telling and saturate us with political agenda. We can flip on the news, we want entertainment and your viewers are smarter than this. This is a good way to kill a show, and unlike many of your characters it won't come back to life and the series will go out in flames like Dexter!"
"American horror story is a great if you're into this kind of horror, people that are into slasher movies/shows will probably not like this.

Overall AHS has its low seasons and high seasons, every season is very different and that's why most people aren't into all the seasons. Overall probably the best thing about this show is the casting and acting. Sarah Paulson, Evan Peters, Jessica Lange and Kathy Bates for example are incredible actors/actresses that never disappoint in this show.

I personally think its genius how Ryan Murphy managed to make every season very different from the ones before but still manages to connect all of them.

My opinions on the seasons;

1. Murder House: 7.5/10, Great season with some real scary things, not my favorite season, it had flaws but the casting was amazing. 2. Asylum: 9/10, Scariest season of all for sure, my kind of horror. You'd expect that a season that is mostly filmed in just one building would be kinda boring, but it sure wasn't. Incredibly great season 3. Coven: 8.5/10 probably the most hated season of the show, but why? I loved it. Sure, it wasn't that scary and it had flaws but the casting was perfect. Lange and Emma Roberts were both perfect for their roles. Evan Peters annoyed me though, his role with the whole love triangle with Madison and Zoe was stupid. Probably my favorite season although it wasnt scary at all. 4. Freak Show: 5.5/10 Doesn't compete with the other seasons to me, the casting was good but that was about it. Overall I kinda enjoyed it, I guess? The ending was disappointing although Lange left the series in a great way. The only character I really enjoyed was the villain. Not a great season, sorry. 5. Hotel: 6.5/10 Not a very beloved season by most, but to me it was watchable and I dont feel like I wasted my time watching it. The casting was okay, Lady Gaga did great job acting and definitely added a great touch to the season but apart from that it wasn't a really interesting season all around. A lot of blood and sex but not the best season of the show. Overall I would recommend watching it although most people aren't into it. 6: Roanoke 7/10 Finally another scary season. The season felt like a haunted-House horror movie but longer. Sarah Paulson did incredible as the ""crazy, paranoid wife"". A big plot twist in the middle of the season and it left me with some confusion but I sure did enjoy this season. 7. Cult 7/10 Before the season started I was really scared I wasn't gonne like this, politics, clowns and Evan as the villian, but after watching it I actually enjoyed it. The concept was alright to me and some episodes were just boring. Again, Sarah Paulson played the crazy wife but again, she portrayed it well. Her wife was very annoying and I hoped she'd die early on but she didn't. The ""different"" episode with Frances Conroy was incredibly boring and didnt feel needed but sure let's forget about it. Sarah did a perfect job and her character was great, excited to see more of her next season.

I love this show and I'm definitely excited for season 8 (Apocalypse) and season 9&10. I can understand why people dislike it but it just is your cup if tea or it isn't. Hope to see more of these horror shows in the future."
"Ride Tides finale sucked then the second half Death Valley was the worst I've seen of this show. I don't care that people thought it was woke or whatever, it's just that Death Valley was awful. I thought the aliens idea was good an I was excited for it but the story was like watching a short movie with no real ending. And that short movie was crap. Death Valley actually made me not want to watch another AHS season again. It felt like the whole season was rushed after episode 4."
"A dysfunctional family moves into an old house, a house with a history of horror. For the main characters, history is what the first episode is all about: the husband's history of infidelity, the wife's history of having a bloody stillbirth, the daughter's history of cutting herself -- for each a long history of pain and resentment and longing for change, though it quickly becomes apparent the only change coming will leave them hysterically screaming to the sudden, violent, gory end. The one sure thing this show promises is that people will die horribly, and we will all be terrified by it.

The characters are not likable; they may not even be redeemable. Even the suffering wife is bitter and cold and hateful. But do they deserve what horrible things will assuredly happen to them? Nope. Which means their fight is our fight, and their fear is our fear.

American Horror Story is interesting, entertaining, suspenseful, and ambitious. After watching the first episode, I want to watch some more."
"I loved the first 2 seasons of ahs. This show had some good early seasons, especially asylum and freak show. Dandy and Twisty are terrifying. After season 4 freak show ahs went downhill. But the later seasons are awful. 0/10. After season 8 it becomes unwatchable. The opening credits of the show are the best part."
"I have LOVED AHS! But Delicate is not keeping me entertained at all. I am just not feeling Kim Kardashian in this.... I have watched the first 3 episodes and just cannot connect with her on this one. I hate to say it...but I just don't think I can watch anymore of this one. I hope they have another season...without Kim. I may be the only person on earth that feels this way, who knows, but she just does not fit the part at all. Overall, I have enjoyed all of the other seasons as they have kept me wanting more with each episode. I still think the first season is by far my favorite. It left me stunned when I realized I, in fact, did not have that one figured out half way through the season."
"This season of American Horror Story seems so far almost like a side project for Ryan Murphy to further study the time period related to Dahmer. Not an American Horror Story type story at all. I did not tune into this series for this. It might be a valid and decent story, but, it belongs elsewhere. Very disappointed. Not sure if will watch further because I really did want to see the American Horror Story series. Not a social commentary on the 80's AIDS epidemic and gay cultural struggles set upon the back drop of a serial killer who drugs and kills gay men. If it was under a different project and not by the same creator who just gave us Dahmer with Evan Peters (which is such a stellar show on its own) I would not be forced to compare this with Dahmer - & I might be more likely to have wanted watch this under the AHS umbrella I miss the old American Horror Story."
"These days when the genre of horror is brought up most people think of the latest slasher bloodfest like ""A Nightmare on Elm Street"" or the latest attempt at trying to scare us with some lame movie like ""The Ring"". It might be a problem with the time constraints of a 90 minute or 2 hour movie, it's hard to completely capture the audience and slowly twist the perceptions.

Another thing forgotten in recent horror movies is the fact of NOT explaining everything within 5 minutes of it happening, it's more entertaining and spooky to speculate why someone sees something or what actually happened in a particular scene. People forget that in some of the best horror pictures like ""Psycho"" the real horror came from the suspense and the wondering of what was going to happen and that the violence was secondary.

The dialogue between characters is actually impressive especially in a couple scenes that you will be able to easily pick out. Ryan Murphy and Brad Falchuk who also created Nip/Tuck and Glee (odd combo) seem to be able to excel in almost any genre and especially now in horror. It's rare to writers like this who aren't afraid to jump around from genre to genre fearlessly.

It's hard to describe many aspects of this show without giving away to much so I must refrain from describing the plot as it appears so far.

The day after I viewed the pilot episode I was shocked to see all the negative feelings towards the content of the show. So let's be VERY clear this show is classified MA which stands for ""Mature Audiences"" which should be taken the same as and ""R"" rating for films, so if you don't want you or your kids to see it that's fine but don't get all pissy about a show you decided to watch that was marketed as a ""psycho-sexual horror"". Yes there is scenes of semi explicit sexual acts and scenes of disturbing violence but it's a horror story so images like that are to be expected.

It's refreshing to find a show that is different and does not follow traditional formula's TV horror shows. I plan to watch every week and enjoy the series fully, since it is honestly very rare to see a show do better in it's genre then most recent films.

American Horror Story arrived a couple weeks ago on the great FX network that also houses two of my favorite shows: ""Sons of Anarchy"" and ""Justified""."
"AHS is sometimes a great show. Some seasons are amazing and some are just ok. Season 9 was not that great and so far season 10 is awful. The writing now feels like it was written by a teenager. The dialogue doesn't feel natural at all. The whole vibe is different and amateurish. Scenes are included that are ridiculous and don't make sense, even for a fictional horror show.

I highly recommend the early seasons though so I'm still rating it highly. It was innovative and unique. I looked forward to the episodes every week. The cast, acting, and the writing were all phenomenal. There were fan theories that they all tied together which made it even more interesting. If they would've ended it on top it would be a 10/10."
"The first seasons of AHS was very good. Something fresh, always a story with a twist, and they had Jessica Lange and then unknown Sarah Paulson and Evan Peters. I really liked the dark, gritty style, changing from season to season. Unfortunately, after Freak Show, which I really liked, there has been a letdown in quality for each season. The departure of Jessica Lange made a big void, but Sarah Paulson has shown us that she is indeed a versatile star. But Hotel was the beginning of a decline, with the infamous, stupid glorified serial killer episode. Ryan Murphy himself said 3 years ago he was out of ideas, so time to put a lid on it. You aint doing any favors with the new American Horror Stories. And the new actors are terrible, with an exception in Billie Lourd."
"I used to be such a huge fan of the show, and in my opinion seasons 7 and 8 were its pinnacles. I re-watched them several times because they are pure masterpieces. Then, Season 9 came around, and I was so disappointed and couldn't stop questioning whether it was made by the same people who had created all the previous seasons. In season 10, things got even worse. While the first part of the season seemed promising, its finale turned out to be so underwhelming that I felt really let down. Being so disenchanted by it, I couldn't pass even the first episode of the second installment, which, in general, appeared super unappealing. Moving on to this last season, the first episode of Season 11 is such a bummer that I'm not going to continue watching this show anymore. That's enough! It's official, AHS is dead. I was asking myself the whole time while watching that ridiculous episode what it even had to do with AHS. Where is a horror in this story? Where are all the great characters? I understand why all the lead actors from pervious seasons decided to distant themselves from the show. From now on, I will do the same."
"There are so many things that could have gone wrong with F.X. attempting to take on a genre that American Film makers have turned into a high school idiot machine. Thankfully the people who made this know what they are doing. If you are a horror buff you will understand what I am talking about after a couple of viewings. It could have been so easy to make a high school shock fest all wrapped up for a safe and appropriate viewing experience. This show is weird, deranged, creepy, and best off all well acted and well written. Great character development that is based on things people would actually do if they faced that situation. This show really does have a bright future if they keep rolling at this pace. I must say, I am very impressed. Almost Walking Dead impressed. This show though is way more deranged then Walking Dead though. Keep it up F.X. . You have a potential winner on your hands. This show of course is not for everybody. The people who don't like it would be better served by watching something a little more tame and mediocre like Tera Nova."
"A pitch-perfect homage/parody of summer-camp slasher movies, AHS/1984 is, for me, the best season of American Horror Story since the exceptional second season, Asylum. However, there's no denying it's divisive, and AHS purists probably won't be overly impressed. For one thing, it's a dark and camp comedy before it's a thriller or a horror. For another, it leans very heavily into '80s clichés and slasher movie tropes. On the other hand, it's consistently hilarious, it doesn't take itself seriously, and despite the ridiculousness of the plot and the twists layered on top of twists, it manages to elicit quite a bit of empathy for a couple of characters who were introduced as one-dimensionally irredeemable. And the soundtrack, wardrobe, and hairstyles have more '80s cheese and excess than you could ever imagine.

LA, 1984. Montana (), a fiery devil-may-care extrovert; Xavier (a superb ), a self-serious aspiring actor; Chet (), a professional athlete who has been suspended from Team USA for the 1984 Olympics after failing a drug test; and Ray (), a friendly man with a troubling secret, are heading to work as counsellors at a newly reopened summer camp called Camp Redwood. They ask their new friend Brooke () to join them, but she declines. However, that night, she's attacked by Richard Ramirez, aka the Night Stalker (a brilliant ). She fends him off, but the incident convinces her to join the others. At Redwood, they meet Margaret (an exceptional ), who survived a massacre there in 1970 and now owns the camp; Rita (), the nurse; Bertie (), the chef; and Trevor (a hilarious ), the activities director. Meanwhile, Benjamin Richter, aka Mr Jingles (a scene-stealing ), the former groundskeeper at Redwood and perpetrator of the 1970 massacre, escapes from a nearby mental facility and heads to the camp.

The first thing you'll notice about 1984 is how immersed it is in slasher movie references and tropes, with a particular preference for and, especially, , both of which are referenced throughout the nine episodes. Not quite a post-modernist reimagining of the genre, the season could stand as a respectable slasher story in its own right, and in this sense, the tone is absolutely pitch-perfect. Take the opening credits. Whereas previous AHS sequences are usually unnerving, the opening to 1984 is a thing of tacky '80s beauty - shot on VHS in 1.33:1 (the recording even has some visible tracking lines from time to time), the pastel-infused credits are made up of shots of aerobics, tape decks, gaudy fashion, dodgy '80s video graphics, VCRs, Ronald Reagan, and roller skates. Meanwhile, the unsettling AHS theme music is here reproduced on a synth. It's horrible, cheesy, about as unthreatening as you can imagine, and awesome.

The show goes on to hit classic genre markers such the campfire scene used to provide heavy exposition, the clichéd chase scene where the girl being pursued keeps tripping and falling over, the characters continually splitting up for various (dubious) reasons, and the plethora of pseudo-POV shots from behind trees.

Having said all that, however, there are certainly elements of postmodern-esque deconstruction at play; the girl with the huge breasts becomes the guy with the huge penis, the black characters survive beyond the opening act, the quintessential shower scene upon which someone is spying involves not women but men, and there's a fascinating pseudo-meta defamiliarisation of the clichéd notion that despite being flesh and blood humans, serial killers in slasher films are notoriously difficult to kill.

A vital element of any season of AHS is humour, and so too 1984. Usually, the best laughs come from the earnestness of the characters, who are blissfully unaware of how ridiculous they sound. So, when Brooke meets Xavier, he tells her, dead-pan, ""I trained with Stella Adler. I'm method"". Later on, he discusses the dangers of being in a coma by referencing the song, ""Coma Chameleon"". After one of the characters is badly burned, an argument breaks out and when someone tells this character to breathe, they proclaim, ""I have breathed the fire of a thousand white-hot suns"". Discussing Billy Idol, a character points out to Ramirez, ""You can't sing ""Rebel Yell"" and not be a rebel"", a point he concedes as pretty reasonable.

Thematically, despite its campiness, 1984 does actually have some things to say. The most obvious issue is media commodification of serial killers. Whether it be by making a movie or putting their face on a magazine, serial killers and mass murderers sell, and there's something inherently wrong about that; why do we give serial killers cool nicknames and then endlessly engage with them in every way imaginable, thus giving them exactly what so many of them want - infamy. And, of course, it wouldn't be AHS without looking at gender issues. Here we see a critique of the notion that female victims of male serial killers are celebrated as ""feminist heroes"", as if they'd rather be an icon than be alive. There's also a nicely written reformulation of the serial killer trope whereby women are not believed as they fight male monsters.

In terms of problems, on the one hand, there is too much time spent on explaining things the audience already knows and hitting character beats we've already hit. On the other, there is a disorienting and not entirely successful time jump between the second to last and last episode, and it feels almost like there was an episode skipped between the two, especially insofar as the finale ill-advisedly introduces an entirely new character (this sense of truncation isn't helped that the season is only nine episodes - AHS's shortest yet). Some viewers will also undoubtedly find the humour too camp and too frequent, undermining the horror element, whilst some will find the plethora of references nothing more than pastiche, intertextuality for its own sake.

All in all, I thoroughly enjoyed this season of American Horror Story. It's not the most thrilling or unnerving, but it is the funniest and most self-reflexive. Strong characters, typically tremendous acting, and some genuinely heartfelt moments combine with great costumes, foolish hair, and a soundtrack of so-bad-they're-great songs to produce a season that might mean little to those born post-1989, but to the rest of us is an ode to the achingly familiar."
"Initially I was left wondering how - what essentially is a short horror movie - could be made in to a long running TV series, but after a few episodes I started to realise that it's the Ryan Murphy magic that is sustaining this outstanding show.

Much like Nip/Tuck, you have to suspend your belief and see this as purely entertainment. There's so many open ended narratives that are slowly unfolding and although at times the show verges on the edge of cliché, a single episode could easily match the brilliance of such horror classics like The Amityville Horror and The People Under the Stairs.

At the end of every episode I feel shocked that 40 minutes have gone by, which is a sure sign that this show is pure, unadulterated, entertainment."
"Season 7 - Cult. I will be completely honest, the first 2 episodes really turned me off. I figured this season was heading down the same path as Roanoke and perhaps worse with the political and social overtones. HOWEVER, I decided to keep watching. Things have turned around dramatically and I am now engaged in this season. It is ridiculous and unbelievable, but the characters are now starting to show themselves and several secrets are now out in the open. The show has been very good the past 3 episodes and has officially drawn me back in.

I will say this... the 5th episode ""Holes"" is brutal. I've been watching horror for over 30 years and I can honestly say I haven't had a scene un-nerve me to the extent this one did. Watch and you'll see what I mean."
"I love horror, both plain or horror comedy. This one has it all. It's sometimes haunting, sometimes silly, weird, disturbing, fabulous, campy... but always interesting. Full of colorful characters, unpredictable plots and great cinematography, it is one of my favorite series ever. It's not for everyone though, many love it, many hate it... some will like a couple of seasons and dislike other ones... But I find every single one at least good in some way, if not great or excellent. Favorite seasons so far - 1, 4, 5 and 9. As it is anthology, you can watch in any order, although some seasons are intertwined, but it's subtle. Recommended for any horror lover, or horror/dark comedy lover!"
This latest season is boring and slow as all hell! Wasn't a fan of 1984 either. Let get back to Mansion and asylum type seasons. Last couple seasons have been mediocre and corny. Time to step up the writing.
Some seasons have been really good. Some have been nothing special but still watchable. The last season with the double feature was horrible. The first part was fine. Nothing special but still decent enough to watch. The second half was horrible. I found myself fast forwarding through the finale because it was just that bad.
"I remember watching the first season of American Horror Story (now called Murder House) and thinking ""WHAT THE H*** WITH THIS SHOW?"" - it was unexpected, visceral, graphic and just really compelling. Twists came out you so fast and the characters were all memorable and stunning.

Seasons 1-7 really are good with my favorite being ""Asylum"" - Murder House, Coven, Hotel all add pieces to already stunning puzzle. Good writing, well shot. Both Roanoke and Freakshow were a bit weak but in both cases you could see the writers were trying to stretch and pushed past what they could do. Cult was the worst of this group as showrunners tried their hands at politics which didn't really translate to this genre. Still, it was visual and interesting.

Season 8 picks up characters and storylines from the best of the previous seasons and gives a full-circle story. Worth every minute with characters (particularly from MH and Coven) you really like.

Season 9 forward shows what happens when a series runs out of what made it great. In trying to start a ""new"" arc - the show is all over the place and really poor in quality. The emphasis on ""hot gay characters' replaces deep or quirky people, and the show itself searches for a genre - 1984 can't decide if its making fun of 80's slasher films or if its trying to be one, Double feature gives anthology style a chance and fails twice - neither story is long enough to tell a good story or short enough to dismiss. NYC is the AIDS allegory no one asked for, and Delicate shows AHS at its saddest grasp yet - writing a vehicle for Kim Kardashian because. Love her or hate her, people will watch here.

AHS has gone from ground-breaking TV to the lowest of low hanging fruit. Watch 1-8 or at least watch 1,2,3, 6, 8. Let go of the rest."
"When a show goes from starring Jessica Lange to Kim Kardashian, it's time to throw in the towel.

This was once something I looked forward to each year, until Jessica Left, Kathy Bates had had enough misery, and here came Lady Whatever, nepotism baby-who-wouldn't-be-famous-if-it-weren't-for-her-aunt-and-father Emma Roberts (she has no stage/film ""it"" factor like the others), and a host of others lesser-talented actors. It had its highlights (Wes Bentley, Kathy Bates, Angela Bassett), but nothing could replace the cast roster of the of the original first season. It's a shame Jessica Lange had had enough, because I'd watch her read the phonebook. It's time to retire this show."
"So the writing wasn't of an A class standard, but the show last for over 10 seasons so you can't say that some people or should i say alot of people didn't like it or else it wouldn't have lasted that long. Here's just a summary of a few of the characters and why they made Baywatch so fun to watch and enjoy.

David Hasselhoff (Mitch)- Right, he wasn't the greatest of actors and i'll be the first to admit it but David provided the show with alot of advertising and was the only character in the show's history to last all 9 seasons of Baywatch: California. Mitch brought the machoness to the show and he always put on stellar performances when they were needed.

Pamela Anderson (CJ Parker)- Again not one of the best actresses but basically I think most of us know she was only really there for the eye candy, but CJ gave us some memorable moments on the show too especially when she struggled to find love through her years at Baywatch.

Yasmine Bleeth (Caroline Holden)- She has to be one of the best actresses to ever grace the Baywatch shores, Caroline was the shy, seductive type who was always getting things wrong with her work and like CJ with her love life. Unlike Pamela, Yasmine wasn't afraid to take to the water.

Alexandra Paul (Stephanie Holden)- Another good actress to grace the Baywatch shores and I think the only one to actually die, weird, but Stephanie's death was one of the best acted episodes from all characters.

Gena Lee Nolin (Neely Capshaw)- One of the only hardcore bitches to come to baywatch and she was a real bad girls, sueing Matt Brody and forcing him to quit after false sexual harrasement charges, sleeping with Logan and manipulating him in front of Caroline, seducing Cody and tricking Mitch into marrying her. She provided the best entertainment on the show and always got her commupance.

I could go through the rest but i'll not, but basically Baywatch provided us with some other great actors and actresses like Erika Eleniak, Nicole Eggert, Carmen Electra, Kelly Packard, Mitzi Kapture, Angelica Bridges and so many more."
"In 1989 are TV screens were graced with a show about beautiful lifeguards patrolling a California beach, so the theme of the show was reasonable and most of the actors were also acceptable. In 1989 we saw the first lifeguards (of many) to grace the Baywatch shores, Shauni McClain (Erika Eleniak), Eddie Kramer (Billy Warlock), Jill Riley (Shawn Weatherly) a few others which never lasted and of course Mitch Buchannon (David Hasselhoff). Basically the pilot episode is not to be missed it is full of action, excitment and seduction and episodes from Season 1-3 were pretty good.

However Baywatch had alreayd lost three primary characters Shauni, Eddie and Jill all left the show within the first three seasons, although Baywatch did have an epiphany and that was to hire Pamela Anderson (CJ Parker), at the start Pamela's character was brilliant and she carried the show easily along with other newly hired characters Summer Quinn (Nicole Eggert), Matt Brody (David Charvet) and Stephanie Holden (Alexandra Paul) from 92-95 all the characters stayed until Summer and Matt suddenly left Baywatch but luckily Baywatch fans were given relief when Caroline Holden (Yasmine Bleeth) joined the show (clearly the best actress). The show continued to go on well with David trailing behind in every episode along with Hobie (Jeremy Jackson) and Steph's death was brilliant as well, the show was still good in 95 when they hired bad girl Neely Capshaw (Gena Lee Nolin) who corupted everyone on Baywatch lives with her manipulation and seduction.

In 96 a big error was made Pamela and Yasmine's contracts were up and both girls wanted to do something else, I think Pamela's head did become a bit big during the end as Yasmine did guest appear in many episodes before finally being wrote out of the show unlike Pamela. The show hired 7 new actresses/lifeguards to fill the void left by both Donna Martin (Donna D'errico), Jordan (Traci Bingham), Samantha Thomas (Nancy Valen), April Giminski (Kelly Packard), Lani McKenzie (Carmen Electra), Taylor Walsh (Angelica Bridges) and Skylar Bergman (Marilece Andrada) were all hired to try and fill the void and granted most of them were reasonably good actresses however they only last a year on the show before all apart from April leaving Baywatch.

When they all did in 98, in 99 the show once again suffered a blow when Gena Lee also left and they brought it Jesse Owens (Brooke Burns) and Alex Ryker (Mitzi Kapture), Mitzi was brilliant and really helped the show but not enough as they relocated to Baywatch Hawaii and she got out while she could. Baywatch Hawaii ran for two seasons with a few good actors and actresses including Krista Allen, Brande Roderick and a few others but finally folded.

BEST ACTRESSES: YASMINE BLEETH, MITZI KAPTURE, GENA LEE NOLIN BEST ACTORS: NONE THEY WERE ALL CRAP"
"Once the world's most-watched TV programme, Baywatch has become a significant part of television history.

Okay, so it's not known for great plots (except maybe for the first few years) and brilliant acting, but, once upon a time, EVERYONE watched it.

Personally, I watched most of episodes from 1990-1994, I of course, liked Pam and Yasmine, but to be honest, my favourite part of the show was the beginning theme... and I have no idea why.

It's been a great stepping stone for many Californian model-type actresses, and Pam wouldn't have been as big (and I mean that in a non-boob-job kinda way) without it.

I haven't seen any episodes outside of 94, but the memories I do have of the episodes I viewed were pretty good!!

I don't know if it has finished in the States, and I don't really care. I've seen as many eps as I care to have sat through, and that's enough for me!

""Baywatch"" R.I.P 1989-2001"
"There are actually some good reasons, why a person should take the risk of going totally insane by watching this show. The breasts are nice, even though some of them aren't that real, but they usually come in pairs, which is good. Watching the beach on your screen is also a very relaxing experience, as it is an ideal place for just taking it easy and not worrying too much about getting eaten by a rubber shark. It's always good to remember, that David Hasselhoff is a god. Not the god, but a god. It's not so much about his acting skills, since there are none, but his chesthair does a lot of talking. Also, there's no KITT hanging out in this series, which is good, since Mr Hasselhoff told in an interview, that he always thought KITT was gay. Naturally that might make him to look like an idiot, but considering the other statements he has made lately, it shouldn't be surprising to anyone.

In a nutshell, this is the kind of show, that is totally harmless to people. It gives us a lot to stare at and a lot to laugh at, which is something many intentionally humoristic shows really don't give us. I have to say, it's no wonder that Borat fell in love with Pamela Anderson. I enjoy watching the show. No, it's not a great show, actually it's quite horrible, but I enjoy watching it. It's basically like a B-movie stretched to last for a decade."
"So the writing wasn't great, the storylines weren't brilliant and some of the actors weren't of an oscar winning standard, but it was a popular TV show that millions of people watched and enjoyed. It had some great moments and lasted for 11 seasons, most shows don't get past 5 never mind eleven.

Baywatch had its ups and downs but it was always fun to watch and an enjoyable show also you had the eye candy like Pamela Anderson, Yasmine Bleeth, Erika Eleniak, Donna D'errico, Brooke Burns, Mitzi Kapture, Alexandra Paul, Nicole Eggert, Marilece Andrada, Brande Roderick and so many more, so don't critisize it because I can guarantee you loved it in its prime."
"Like I said it's decent. DECENT acting, decent plots... I'm rewatching the entire series right now after having not seen it since it aired. Every episode I find something to go what the f about... either reusing the same shot like many shows did back then. Problem with that is when you watch every episode back to back, you REMEMBER every time a director did that and thought we wouldn't' notice. It's like Airwolf if anyone remembers that. Reusing the same island or the same factory (or the same fly-by scene) multiple times, even though it's supposed to be on another CONTINENT (but it's nowhere near as bad in this, in fact I only remember it happening like twice and I'm in season 7). lol... Or another gripe, bad set pieces. Like one episode I just watched today, they go zoomed in on a boulder (the episode with Hulk Hogan and Macho Man) that a kid slips on then gets his foot trapped underneath. When the kid stepped on it, you could see the ""boulder"" cave in... it's like, did no one see that? There were other horrendous set pieces but i don't remember at the moment. My biggest gripe about this show that really bothers me as an adult, almost every other episode when someone is drowning they're in KNEE DEEP WATER and can just stand the hell up lol... Like one in particular, 3 lifeguards rush in the water to pull the person out, the water wasnt' even up to their knees! The person's splashing around TEN feet from the shore when they can just walk in... Another episode, 3 people are waving for help on a small boat, as soon as the Scarab gets near they fall over of course. Of course no one knows how to swim (in this particular episode or the entire series), let alone dog paddle back to the boat, IN PERFECTLY CALM WATERS. I dove in the ocean in the bahamas once on a high school trip just to get a fishing line unstuck from rocks like 10 feet down. What I'm seeing in this show is just ridiculous. Now if they're getting dragged out by a rip current fine, but most of the time it's not. It's just people going to the beach, get in the water, and suddenly don't know how to swim lol... honestly if it wasnt' for the babes I don't think I would've gotten past the first few seasons."
"Some shows are crap and at the same time I can give them respect for being iCONIC.

Baywatch is one of those crap shows that I respect.

Verdict: This show was filled with a lot of TRANS-TASTIC VISUALS."
"Baywatch is definitely a guilty pleasure show from my youth, my best friend and I would watch it at some point during each summer. If you're going into it expecting high art then that's your own mistake, in terms of sheer comedy and entertainment? It is excellent, the storylines manage to both be formulaic yet at the same time absolutely out of left field. I mean there's always some kind of accident occuring on the beach, but is it someone drowning, does someone require surgery or is it a chemical weapon that needs to be disarmed... also somehow on the beach? The answer is always yes, yes it is.

Having read other reviews I disagree that the acting is terrible outright, it isn't Tom Hanks in Philadelphia but we're not talking Tommy Wiseau level either. It is a perfectly adequate soap opera standard of acting, which is fine for a show that really doesn't take itself that seriously."
"While this review may upset many its how I honestly feel. Baywatch from 1989 was absolutely nothing like what came from 1993 on-wards. Yes the special effects may have gotten better and stories more fleshed out but what made the original shows (89-92) so great was that they had believable characters, close nit story lines and build-able foundations. In my own personal opinion Pamela wrecked the show not improved it. It also annoys me that when people think of Baywatch she is all they think of. The show wasn't the Pamela Anderson show. They really went overboard with the TNA showing after series 3.

The original cast of Hasslehoff, Stevenson, Warlock, Eleniak, Call, Gagnier, Williams, Weatherly, Phelps. Newman, Nelson and Markham is what made the show brilliant. The developing romance between Shauni and Eddie. Friendships develop between Eddie and Court. The close nit story lines of Jill and Shauni. The experience of Craig and the love shared by Gina. The bond between Hobe and Mitch (Sorry but Jackson was a HORRIBLE Hobie compared to Brandon) and Plus the cockiness of Cole.

When Warlock and Elenaik left after the 3rd episode of series 3 and Pamela came in it really took a turn for me and whilst the later series are enjoyable to watch for what they were. Nothing will beat the original series' and stories for me. Baywatch will always in my mind be about the people I mention above. Plus nothing will beat Save Me by Peter Cetera as a main theme. Sorry Jim but it's just simply better than I'll Be Ready.

If you love close stories and developing characters then watch the original series' 1, 2 and 3. If you want Eye-Candy but more action scenes then watch from series 3 onward. Also Erika will always be the Queen of the Beach!"
"David Hasselhoff and Pamela Anderson's magnum opus from the late eighties is shameless exploitation, but the hot bodies are enough to make it worth watching, if miss-able. There's really nothing more to say other than the fact that this show seriously boosted Pam's career, and made it possible for her to prove her acting skills in the action epic ""Barb Wire"" seven years later. OK, so maybe that movie wasn't that good, but at least Pam got naked a lot in it, so it has to be worth something, right?

Anyway, this show is to be taken at face value. Ignore all poor attempts at characterization and plot and just enjoy the hot beach people bouncing around."
"The reason people watch Baywatch is because of the amount of human flesh on show. Red-blooded males such as myself tuned in back in 1989 to see women in bikini's and I am sure there were probably many females who adored David Hasselhoff.

However, to be fair, Baywatch did have some great stories once you got past the flesh on show. David Hasselhoff did a good job as Mitch Buchanan who was an interesting character. There were some very competent actors and actresses throughout the show.

There's not really much scope for stories about lifeguards. How many stories can you have around lifeguards saving a person from drowning? Not many. Baywatch also focused on the characters private lives and at times, Mitch Buchanan found himself in battle with the usual bad guys.

Baywatch was a decent show. There's no denying what the appeal to the show is but in the interests of fairness, it really did have good stories at times."
"Baywatch showed the exploits of a bunch of Los Angeles County Lifeguards. Granted most of them were super hot babes who just happened to be the lifeguards, but who's complaining? The main character throughout the course of the show was Mitch Buchanon who's a veteran Lifeguard and former Navy SEAL.

Just about every episode they would do about a 10 minute montage of them driving around on jet skis, dunebuggies and whatever to kill time. With all the fluff of the show it still made an effort to show lifeguards in a positive life and what they do on a daily basis to save the lives of people on their stretch of the beach.

One of the most popular lifeguards in the course of Baywatch was C.J. Parker played by Pamela Anderson."
"Boring, pointless, stupid, dull, and brainless. Why this ever aired on television is beyond me. A time waster, though staring at the wall may be a bit more entertaining."
"I don't like some of the remastered parts of baywatch. There are some songs that they changed that I don't like. One song for sure is, ""I would die for you"" from season 4, episode 2. That song was better. They should have kept the show as is, but add scenes never shown, change the quality, which they kind of did."
"I did not watch this show in it's day even though I would have been right in it's demographic then, I think I may have caught an episode or two but don't really recall. I knew the premise and who doesn't love watching good looking people, in my case the swimsuit clad women. Being a little bored with the usual streaming selections lately I thought I'd try it out now. Hope Marie Carlton was in the pilot and that caught my attention, I should have known better. If you want to watch it solely for the skin I guess you're in the right place. If you're looking for good writing and meaningful story lines this for sure isn't your show. Given that, there isn't enough of the swimwear clad women to keep me engaged in actively watching the show. I'll watch more episodes as something to have on in the background while I'm doing other things and see if any good story lines emerge but it's not a show that engages the viewer and with the changes the internet has brought likely even less so over 20 years later. I'm curious to see how the show develops over it's run though simply due to my viewing habits of having frivolous content on in the background when I'm not truly watching."
"I've actually never watched this show before, it was just so overrated for so many years & advertised towards men. Kind of like how Charlie's Angels was ruined when Farrah fawcett did what was at the time a soft p*** poster that ended up in everyone's bedrooms. You kind of just say to yourself, well that's not within my realm of morality, and you compartmentalize into taboo/late night/no kids.

But I decided to take a look at it because I've always loved beach movies, I'm a big beach fan myself, I love everything about the ocean. And here it was free all over every platform. So I looked at a few of the seasons - in the earlier seasons it really seems family oriented there isn't anything overtly sexual or gory or violent but nobody knew about it then because it wasn't the big turn-on that it became eventually. Early stages were just pretty ordinary people mostly of the attractive variety with normal average bodies you would find in a gym or any fitness studio. You could actually say that it's kind of a Charlie's Angels on the beach but with hot guys also. They have everyday problems that may seem a little over the top at times, they have rescues that are moderately well orchestrated. The acting isn't very good, the music is horrible - but it was not unlike many of the other shows of that time as far as acting, dialogue, scenes. But the scenery was a big upsweep from the standard show of the day where it was always set in a house or an office or a corporate building.

Somebody mentioned that everybody does look like that on the beach and so hey it's not a big deal lol but I must admit that I've been to a lot of beaches and very rarely do you see that many good looking people all in the same place. There was also a mention that Xena warrior princess might have come to be because of Bay watch opening doors so to speak. But I think they don't realize we've had the sexualization of women for many years starting with Petticoat junction in the '60s as well as Gidget, and then I Dream of Jeannie, Wonder woman... In fact Xena is a spin-off from the earlier series Hercules. I could name several others as well but my point is that this is not really new per se except that in the later series of Baywatch we are presented with Pamela Anderson who is more of a sex object than just a female. I think that made it more popular to some people and less popular overall because it was no longer allowed as family viewing. I mean, when you think of shows like 3rd Rock from the Sun or married with children, those are extremely vulgar in many ways but there wasn't the same sexualizing among the females who were the most appealing. Imagine if they had put Sally or Kelly in super revealing outfits in every episode - mothers would not have allowed those shows to be in their family room despite that there were excessive negative ideas expressed verbally.

Some reviews mention the low budget on this show however I am not so sure - there is a lot of high budget equipment as well as underwater scenes that are expensive to film.

In the later seasons, it did really become too much about Anderson and too many sort of short videos that lingered on bodies, and hasselhoff really thought too much of himself in the later seasons where we see far too much of him.

It's not horrendous, it is entertaining but it does have a lot of what now looks like bad acting, bad dialogue and so forth. I think for its time though it was right up there with shows like Friends or Three's company and so forth. The music is really bad though.

As the last remark I'll just say that Anderson is unrecognizable now, in part because she apparently has the confidence to go without her hair and makeup done just to feel young again, which I can admire. But the truth is the look they brought with her onto Baywatch was from what she would find in a gentleman's club or even worse and the fact that this was pushed onto young women as actual beauty has changed the landscape of young women probably worse than the Barbie doll, which there's a whole psychological profile written about that. Beauty is different from sexual attraction. We should all strive to teach our children that both girls and boys."
"It's quite unbelievable Hasselhoff stroke gold with that. But he did anyway, and nobody can deny that. I'm baffled by the level of badness the show mastered. It clearly was family friendly, and it shows a lot, too much even. It's so neat and tidy, it can be off putting to most, but it never pretended to be something it wasn't either, which makes it nicer than most TV series these days. It could be very preachy, though, but it was just its « family show » pendant talking, I think. I concur with those saying everything went overboard, when Pamela Anderson joined the series. I'm not sure why, but it became sillier since her arrival. And that remastered version is bad. The HD looks great onscreen, but also make the low cost blindingly obvious, and the never ending montages, are tedious to watch with the new soundtrack (that isn't even available to buy online). The music, which was the only thing this show had going for it, when it used to showcase popular tunes each week. Is now too different and too modern sounding, for « Baywatch » to feel the same. And the way they dubbed the live performances with completely different songs, is idiotic and comical to some extent. I also couldn't believe shows like Friends and ER were airing, the same time this one did. Everything looks so old and outdated. And you can see the more the show went on after season 2, the less money they had to pay for decent production. Also, why so many people who clearly can't swim, go to the beach?..."
"During its time, Baywatch was the most watched, most talked about, most hyped and most commercially successful venture on modern television. It is therefore quite strange to see its low rating on IMDb and its extensive criticism from wannabe critics.

Lets be honest here. It was'nt always about babes and unrealistic heroics. A good chunk of the series was dedicated to proper story lines, good acting and good action. It was very well written and very well executed.

Perhaps people have gotten used to an idea that grotesque reality is what TV should reflect? Thats pretty stupid. Baywatch represents a very happy and positive atmosphere and place, bordering on fantasy. It should be commended for at least trying to show a happy world."
"How this thing was on for 10 years, I'll never know... Overly dramatic scenes, montages that make no sense just fill space up, non existing acting, plain stupid plot lines, scenes so cringy your skin crawls... but hey... the it's good if you browse 9gag or iFunny and need something to run in the background while it's summer. Don't expect anything and you'll still be disappointed. Just sayin'..."
"Starts off pretty straightforward, but then the plot thickens... and you're hooked. Some of the adaptations of Stephen King's stories end up atrocious messes, but this one has real potential! Sublime acting.

If only HBO would release the entire series at once. I hate waiting for new episodes. ;)"
"First 2 episodes were very promising and intriguing, directed by Justin Bateman who also performed as a main character. Then the next 8 episodes feel so long, dragging along the story with slow development and minor characters mixing it up.

The reason I kept watching was because of Cynthia Erivo's wonderful performance as Holly. Positive note to Ben Mendonsohn acting too.

In the end, I feel this could have been an 5 episode series or a 2h movie."
"In Cherokee City, Georgia, young Frank Peterson is found brutally murdered. Police detective Ralph Anderson (Ben Mendelsohn) leads the investigation. All evidences point to amiable kids' baseball coach Terry Maitland (Jason Bateman). His wife Glory (Julianne Nicholson) is shocked when he gets arrested on the field. He maintains his innocence and has an indisputable alibi. This case has overwhelming evidences on both sides. With such conflicting clues, Anderson resorts to peculiar private investigator Holly Gibney.

This is like True Detective with a splash of supernatural from by Stephen King. It's got great actors like Ben Mendelsohn doing good character work. It has good atmospherics and great crime drama feels. It's a limited series. I do get frustrated with Ralph as he keeps his denial for too long. The start is addictive. It has its fun surprising weirdness."
"Jason Bateman has become one of my favourite actors, he disappeared from the limelight for years and has come back stronger and better than ever before. This show is absolutely fantastic, you are hooked within the first ten minutes and you can't look away so put your phone on silent and your feet up to enjoy this suspenseful edge of your seat mystery! Forget the negative reviews especially about Ben Mendelson's lisp for goodness sake he's a great actor and anyone with negative reviews clearly doesn't appreciate good acting and film!"
"Absolutely compelling , impossible evidence with awesome performaces."
"First of all, the story was great. This series had such great potential to be brilliant, addictive and entertaining, but .. What an artistic poop. The story is stretched, situations prolonged. Long music scenes where nothing happens. The series would have been a great 5 episode miniseries. The 10 episodes were absolutely insane to extend the story, which culminated in the final 50 minute episode, where the actual entertainment was 15-20 minutes. 6/10 because this was ok, but not addictive and entertainment what I expeckted seeing the first episode. What a disappointment."
"When I read this book, I couldn't put it down. The series so far is the SAME WAY - the cast is excellent, the sound editing sets the scene and I am highly doubtful anyone guesses the ending. This is classic Stephen King...believable humans at their worst (and best). Tough to watch and impossible to look away. I hope people stick with the full story (and read the book too)!"
"If you ever wondered what the first season of might have looked like had the merely-hinted-at supernatural elements become more than merely hinted at, then The Outsider gives you a possible answer. Starting as a grim and gritty police procedural, the show takes a left turn in the third episode, before diving head-first into the supernatural in the sixth and seventh. And do these two tones mix well? Kind of. The early episodes are easily the strongest, and as the hokey horror elements start to take over, the foreboding portentousness of those beautifully constructed episodes gives way to Stephen King-isms. Relatable themes such as guilt and the paralysis of grief are dropped in favour of larger (and thus more abstract) issues such as the infectious nature of evil and the ability of ordinary people to band together in extraordinary circumstances (as I said, it's King-101). But for all that, and despite the not entirely successful mixing of genres, I enjoyed the show. I hadn't read the novel, and so I was genuinely invested in finding out where all of everything led. And even though the journey (the early stages, in particular), proved more interesting than the destination, it was a journey that I don't regret taking.

Cherokee City, Georgia. When the badly mutilated corpse of a young boy, Frankie Peterson, is found in the woods, homicide detective Ralph Anderson (the always excellent Ben Mendelsohn) immediately launches an investigation. Within a few hours, it appears the murderer has been identified, with multiple witnesses reporting seeing local little league coach and school teacher Terry Maitland (Jason Bateman) covered in blood near the scene of the crime. When physical evidence and surveillance footage further point to Terry's guilt, a bull-headed Ralph has Terry arrested in front of the whole town. As Terry's wife, Glory, (a suitably frazzled Julianne Nicholson) and his lawyer, Howie Solomon (Bill Camp; as good as he always is), scramble to understand what has happened, Terry maintains his innocence, saying he was at a teaching conference in another state on the day of the murder, a claim soon backed up by irrefutable evidence. But how can one person be in two places at once?

Airing on HBO, and based on the 2018 novel by Stephen King, the show was adapted for TV by acclaimed novelist Richard Price. Showrunners/executive producers include Price and Jason Bateman (who also co-stars and directs the first two episodes, establishing the Ozark-esque aesthetic template). Novelist Dennis Lehane also contributes scripts for two of the later episodes.

If the show has a singular standout element (aside from the excellent ensemble cast), it's the aesthetic design. Bateman, who has directed multiple episodes of Ozark, establishes a dark and gritty tone in the first two episodes, imbuing every shot with a foreboding sense of unease. Shadows abound; bright colours are muted, with greys and washed-out blues dominating; characters are often shown isolated in long shot, framed in doorways, or pushed into corners; depth of field is often extremely shallow; camera movements are methodical and slow; the editing is non-linear enough to keep the narrative slightly off-kilter (although this non-linearity is confined primarily to the first two episodes and the opening of episode nine); there's even a split-diopter used at one point to keep the foreground and background in perfect focus. The show looks every inch an HBO prestige crime drama. There are also some nice directorial flourishes. For example, in the last episode (directed by Andrew Bernstein), as the good guys are moving through a cave, they pass a body of water and we see the villain's eyes non-diegetically reflected in the water, taking up almost all of the screen's real-estate. Sure, it's not subtle, but it looks good.

Perhaps the most noticeable aesthetic element is the discordant score by Danny Bensi and Saunder Jurriaans, which helps the atmosphere, tone, and pacing immeasurably. Music cues are often just one deep note, held and elongated for up to two or three seconds. Oftentimes, entire scenes will be scored to these singular notes, giving whatever is on screen a sense of portentousness beyond the purely visual.

For all its aesthetic gymnastics, however, the show does have some problems both stylistic and narrative. For one thing, it's too long; eight episodes would have been more than sufficient to tell this story, and the narrative really starts to drag in episodes five and six. It picks up again in eight (which is largely a character-focused episode), but there's just not enough material to fill 10+ hours. There's also the genre-mixing mentioned earlier. What starts as a tough cop investigating a grisly murder morphs into a quirky paranormal sleuth chasing down an ancient evil, and as these two vie for space, neither genre feels fully developed. The early episodes are creepy and unnerving, with tone and atmosphere doing the heavy lifting. But as the show goes on, the horror becomes broader and less effective, and Price is never really able to fully yoke these two disparate elements into a cohesive whole.

Other problems (presumably) come from the source text, such as the first solid transition into the supernatural, which is based on a coincidence so preposterous that I was convinced the show would return to it to offer an explanation (it does not). There's also the merry band of blue-collar salt-of-the-Earth types who band together to face something beyond any one of them, a trope that King has done to death by this stage.

All in all though, I enjoyed The Outsider for the most part. It has significant problems, but it does a lot right. The aesthetics and acting help a hell of a lot, and although it's far from the best King adaptation ever made (that would remain The Green Mile), it's a damn sight better than recent efforts such as the two It films and (shudder) The Dark Tower."
"It started out excellent, but after a few episodes it divert from the book, probably to extend it to ten episodes. Nevertheless it is a good show. Casting is great, and it keeps the tension and keeps you interested even if you have read the book"
"The acting is great. The story is great. Incredibly watchable. If you like true crime, this as close as fiction can get as far as the feel."
"I loved the first two episodes and was absolutely gripped. Then episode 3 and 4 happened. I was wondering why the style, pacing, even lighting changed for the worse. Why did this suddenly change from an engaging mystery to a slow, arty-farty borefest where the majority of long, lingering scenes are watching people travel on public transport with no dialogue. Far too much time suddenly spent on cinematography than actual story.

Wondering why the sudden change in direction, I noticed that Jason Bateman stopped directing after the second episode and handed the reins over to Andrew Bernstein, who has seemingly made a hash of things. After finishing episode 4 and struggling to stay awake, I'm done.

I only gave it 5 stars as the start was so good."
"Really enjoying this adaptation. Faithful to the story. Jason Bateman just gets better as both an actor (been a fan since ""It's Your Move"" !) and a director; simply but electrifying use of pace, angles & cinematography. He has a delicate touch that leaves you feeling like you're part of the story watching from over a shoulder. Genius."
"I love this show! Not a huge fan of Stephen king's works but the storyline, acting and screenplay of this show really hooked me in. I found myself at the edge of my seat, getting increasingly invested in each of the characters. Great balance of light and dark and excellent character development. A must watch!"
"I just completed the first season of this dark and suspenseful detective/horror series an have to say that it's saving grace is a great cast of veteran actors, including Justin Bateman who also serves as executive producer. Without getting too mired in the details I'll just point out some areas that didn't work for me: 1] Holly, played by Cynthia Erivo left me wondering why her character wasn't developed fully. She literally used the same furrowed brow expression throughout. As for her role, she is intuitive, but is she also clairvoyant? Is she a supernatural? A medium? No one really knows. The show only suggests powers beyond what she showcases, like an eidetic memory and a belief in the supernatural. 2] The creature itself is not interesting. Shape shifting is old as the hills and usually just as boring. It has this weird little encampment in a cave which borders on ridiculous and it also has to eat to survive which is even more ridiculous. Why does it choose to take children? Oh, because they're ""sweeter"" tasting? 3] Then there are the endless stretches of filler that compelled me to fast-forward because there was no reason to be invested in the character's relationships as they never really furthered the plot. Worth a watch but don't expect True Detective season one."
Loved this show. Each episode was intriguing. It was a Cop thriller that kept the supernatural aspect of it at arms length. Maybe 8 or 9 episodes would have been better just to tighten the pacing up a bit. Worth a look.
Just seen Episode 7. It is a great series. Those who watch it are the audience of a seance where evil forces are being invited into your most intimate world...
"Jason Bateman stars and directs this series. Amazing writing and just riddled with mystery. Setting is grey and eerily reminiscent of ""The Killing"". Our household is sucked in and we cannot wait for each Sunday evening. A new episode of the Miniseries is released each week or else we would have zipped through it already. Characters are perfectly selected. Thank you HBO!"
"I've watched 6 episodes so far, and I have to bail on this show. It uses non-stop ominous sound effects and dramatic angles to hide the fact it's halting and withholding plot points to drag the story over 10 episodes. So little happens each episode. I understand the writers and directors are accomplished, but this story suffers from what a lot of streaming shows suffer from: a story that could be told in 3 hours instead of 10. Excellent cast can't redeem it. Also, the story wastes too much time on hardboiled cop show cliches (strip club action, yawn). Cynthia Erivo is amazing. If they cut out all the other parts and focused on her, well, I might go for that."
Great storytelling and cinematography. Really impressed by Jason Bateman.
"First few episodes had me thinking this was going to be a great series. The last two episodes made me so angry that im finding it hard to put it into words. For the life of me i cant figure out how they could screw it up so badly.

If you havent seen this yet, please dont you will only get disappointed and frustrated like me. Its almost like they had good writers in the beginning and they got replaced by total amateurs halfway through..

Dont believe the good ratings, they only saw the first two episodes or are involved in making of the show somehow."
One of the best Stephen King adaptations ever. Takes all of his good stuff and eliminates the bad. Jason Bateman is becoming elite.
Amazing thriller One it's the best I've seen. How come all Stephen kings novel's make wonderful movies he's an amazing writer and the director of this series is also amazing
"I was afraid to begin this serie cause i have two little babies, and the story what i've read soo disturbing... BUT im really glad that i've been watching this cause its as good as the another stephen king inspired series the Castle Rock or even BETTER YET!! The story the actors, the director (THANK YOU MR BATEMAN!!) is so good. I can recommend to everyone who have a bit stronger heart and stomach. But you will not regret it! I wont spoil anything, JUST PLEASE START TO WATCH AND ENJOY every minute that it can give to you!!"
"This show started with an incredible premise. Everyday people starts to have superpowers. Each one discover their power and try to deal with it. There is also serial killer Sylar who discovers a way to kill these special people and take their powers.

Like the brightest of stars, they burn hottest but don't last. This show fizzled as the story got more and more complicated. The vast number of characters with unique superpowers gets out of hand. There are too many to maintain. Like a truck overloaded, it just couldn't continue and rolled over. By the 2nd or 3rd season, this show gets increasingly convoluted and becoming almost unwatchable. They try to reboot the 4th season by adding a whole new set of people and a circus. Of course, it didn't work and the show was canceled. The first season is a 9 or even 10 but it's a long slide into 4 territory at the end."
"I'm writing this review now even though I haven't seen an episode since it got canceled almost 15 years ago. My brother and I were recently talking about this show and it drudged up some old memories I've had for this show, both good and bad. The good: the first season was brilliant. I remember early reviews and word of mouth talking how about how this show was going to be a classic. And it might have if the quality box the first season carried over to the rest. I didn't hate the other seasons, it just wasn't as good as the first. It has an original feel for a superhero show. It didn't have any costumes or anything like that, it was ordinary people reacting like real people who were getting super powers. Some good and some bad. If you're a fan of this genre then give this a try because it's worth a watch."
"Heroes was a superhero show before all the Marvel and DC shows took over. While it's not as good as the shows we get now (at least most of them that is), it was still a solid series...especially the first 2 seasons. After that the quality went down drastically but was still watchable. It was about ordinary people all over the world discovering they developed super powers. There are a bunch of separate stories that all come together to prevent a catastrophic future. The show was really popular when it first came out, so much so they tried to bring it back years after it went off the air with Heroes: Reborn. Do yourself a favor and avoid the reboot at all costs because it was awful. This original Heroes though is absolutely watchable."
"I am writing after a mere 4 episodes in season one and I probably have nothing to say that has not been said by others in terms of praise and admiration. Still, writing this review 13 or so years after it ended, I am aware of the various doom and gloom disappointments in the show as it progressed. And I am here to either defend this or to heap additional blame. For years if not decades, the Hollywood habit has been to destroy beauty. I am not talking about sucking franchises dry with woke agendae, although that certainly is one of the symptoms. I am talking about the deliberate or accidental process of adding needless complexity, darkness, conflict, and unhappiness of all kinds. This even happens, remarkably, with sitcoms. It happens in every genre. But Heroes was destined for this destruction from its inception, because Hollywood hates virtue. What is most interesting about this process is that Hollywood will actually break its own craftsmanship rules, ie, continuity, in order to pursue the goal. Whether this is laziness, stupidity, or contempt for the consumer probably doesn't matter. From Young Sheldon to Game of Thrones, from New Girl to House to House of Cards to Cheers to Friends, this mechanism runs from fairly subtle to brutally obvious. I don't know when this started but I don't think, for instance, that Bonanza pulled this crap. In more recent times, Big Bang may have actually reversed the formula, moving from sad selfish characters to radically improved versions of themselves.

Anyway, most say that Heroes started well and couldn't maintain. Some say it pulled out of the nosedive in later seasons.

I shall see."
"Nice premise, modern-family oriented with just enough edge to keep it interesting. For prime-time network its an ambitious undertaking and very entertaining. For a while..... Sure, the premise is pure fantasy and whimsical, but after a while, it become commonplace so they had to stretch it beyond acceptance.

We get so many back stories and flashbacks, time-jumping with endless new characters thrown in, it gets muddy fast.

Everything that needed to be said should have ended by season-2, but you know the story, NBC enjoys its ad-revenues so they beat this one to death, heavily over-played and labored.""Save the Cheerleader, Save the World"" was great premise and it was all this series needed.

In season-3 things start to get darker and mean-spirited, the characters become more unlikable, and if I have to hear Claire's father say one more time"" I was doing it to protect the family"" I was going to throw a brick into my set. Everybody betrays each others trust, yet they constantly say: ""trust me."" In equal annoyance was the character Hiro. His wimpish-ways were cute for a little while, but they started to get on my nerves, and the music Wendy and Lisa (of Prince fame) composed/implemented was kind of cliche'd Japanese soundbites that played every time Hiro and Ando had a scene (until season 4). The writer(s) made Hiro's character one big Asian cliche. By the end of the 4th season I was just waiting to see who would be killed(written)-off to put me out my misery. Recap: 1st-2 seasons YES, seasons 3 &4- NO! The series gets yanked before the story resolves,so be warned, before you invest all of this time."
"The series did a really good job at giving us a mixed cast of people with cool abilities. A story that's interesting. And a great cast. Sadly the first season is the best season and then it slowly goes downhill. The ending was terrible. But all-all it's a memorable series that deserves to be seen at least once.

I loved the story, it was all over the place, but that made it fun. Lot's of flipping and switching and ups and downs to keep you on your toes. They gave us so many different characters with many different abilities. It never got exhausting to watch. And the cast really was amazing. As always Hayden Penettiere is awesome. And they even threw in a lesbian romance in the last season. I really wish they would have given us a season five to finish off the series properly. It did have a horrible ending. They did end up doing a reboot miniseries but I do not recommend watching it. It has very little to do with the original story.

If you're a big fan of series that have people with abilities, then definitely give this one a go."
"Actually, this is no good for anything less than binging. Unlike many serries' which have the standard formula of each episode or two completing a start and finish problem with a tad of long-term problem for the next episode to the end, this presentation of ""Heroes"" 2006-2010 is one long narrative.

There is a fun side to this program as it does not take you long to notice that all the supposedly ""foreign"" people are in reality American actors.

Many of the actors come from other series some are: Masi Oka (Max Bergman in Hawaii Five-0) James Kyson (Sean Leung in Hawaii Five-0) George Takei (Lieutenant Hikaru Sulu in Star Trek) Nichelle Nichols (Lieutenant Nyota Uhura in Star Trek) Zachary Quinto (Spock in Star Trek movies 2009, 2013, and 2016) Sendhil Ramamurthy (Jai Wilcox in Covert Affairs) Many others will surprise you.

Unlike the episodes the season year ends do take the time and energy to wrap up the story just in case that is the last season. The exception of courses the last season that was getting a little long in the tooth and quits while in full fun. Still watch to the end and you will not feel they left you with a cliff hanger of the feel that this has been a pilot all along.

The series is split into something called ""Volumes"" that do not match the episode numbers.

The series gets to be a tad Hallmark near the end and they start doing weird skit and too many time travel episodes towards the end; if you can call it an."
"Well as we all know Season 1 is by far the best because of its simple yet effective premise and endearing characters. There is indeed a noticeable drop in quality in the following Seasons but that doesn't make them bad. I honestly don't understand why the show was cancelled, it still had potential.

I remember hating Season 4 when I first saw it but I watched it again and it's not that bad. It's a very mixed bag and kind of all over the place, it should have been shorter like Season 2 and more focused on Samuel (who is an interesting villain and very well played) so the writers did screw up by having too many things going on at the same time and therefore losing track of the main story. Still I feel the last episode was satisfying."
"The concept of this show is about people with special powers similar to mutants in the Marvel universe. And how the characters cope with it and what they decide to do with it. The main drive of this show isn't necessarily the the superpowers, but the subconscious and the philosophical aspects that revolve around power. Unfortunately this is one of those shows that has a very captivating and entertaining first season, but goes downhill from there. It probably has to do with the fact that after the first season it was first planned to introduce new characters with brand new main characters with just Suresh (who is sort of the Beast character from the Marvel universe without the furriness). Which didn't go into effect because they wanted to keep the main cast that become dis-likable and annoying as the seasons drags on. The writer strike could have been a big factor why the show started to go downhill after season 1. I think season 2 was the most boring season of all. Season 3 it sort of picks up, but just about everything is so inconsistent with the story and the character that it takes away a lot form the experience. The 4th season revolves around a mutant carnival and they just seemed to drag that on way too much. And the constant love, hate relationship between Claire Bennet (Hayden Panettiere) and Noah Bennet (Jack Coleman) gets really really annoying...Like super annoying and irritating. As a matter of fact most of the chemistry that starts out strong in the first season goes downhill. The story gets poorly written for each season after one that even the characters decisions and motives makes no sense sometimes. Especially the villains in the shows, including Sylar. And to increase the running time of the show, it has multiple story arcs that doesn't go anywhere. One of the most disappointing part about the show is the showdown between Peter and Sylar. The constant plot-holes and tons of time paradoxes when it comes to time travel doesn't make things better. Overall this is a show that has a good start but gets worse and worse with each installment. Who knows, maybe just maybe the fifth season could have been a boost with the world knowing about super humans and might go in the direction like ""True Blood"" except people with super powers going out into the public. And Sylar's redemption might have been cool to watch. To sum it up it's one of those shows that soars skyward with the first season and spirals downward. I give this show a 6.4/10 because I found some of the philosophical aspects to be intriguing.

6.4/10"
"I first saw the teaser commercial for Heroes at the end of Medium's last season and started salivating. And now that I've tuned in I'm hooked. The premise of super-humans has been done before and most recently in Mutant X. And I've been around to check these shows out. The misfit one with Courtney Cox was an old favorite. But none of these shows garnished the pure mystery that Heroes had going for it all the way to the end of the pilot. Plus a killer cast should make it a surefire hit.

I've loved Adrian Pasdar since he chewed up the screen in Profit and while he seems to be playing a similar role here, he is balanced by Milo Ventimigilia as his kid brother with a more human heart and dreams he can fly.

But the real scene stealing of the show belongs to the ladies. Ali Larter creates a believable single mother with serious money problems. Her strange gift is actual scary and has yet to have been fleshed out. The sequence where she awakes to find things have gone horribly wrong in her favor are chill inducing.

And on the flip side Hayden Panettiere's discovery of her gift is grueling, bloody, and refreshingly ironic as a modern day Supergirl. All her stunt work in a cheerleader's outfit made me smile. And by the show's end a revelation comes about her family life that made the show even more interesting.

With a painter who creates art that sees into the future and a comedic turn by Masi Oka and his abilities it's hard not to enjoy heroes. It twists and turns in only an hour and keeps you grounded to the characters and the situations they fall into. The previews for upcoming episodes made me actually want more. If your not tuning in on Monday nights, you might be missing something spectacular."
"I was awestruck watching the way it took off. One character at a time, it kept developing. The fantasy was top-notch, plot like never before. It gave the traditional save-the-world genre, a new look. Season 1 was magnificent. Few characters, mostly Hiro, were impeccable. It did look stretched in the second half. The first 4-5 episodes of season 1 were exceptional. Soon, it started slowing down. Episode 10 was the greatest of them. However, yet again, it started slowing the pace and awesomeness. Only the last couple of them were magnificent after the 10th. The climax was stunning. I enjoyed the complete season 1 and it was a package full of fantasy, emotions, creativity and wonderful characters.

Season 2 never looked the same. It couldn, even for once, keep up to the level of the first.

I eneded in the middle of season 2 until things started making no sense whatsoever. Hiro wasn't hiro either."
"I loved the first series - innovative, good story, slick cgi, great cliff-hangers. Sadly season 2 seemed to lose it's way (story wise), and it all started to get messy - worse still it was full of moments when you say ""what the... why would you do that?!!!?!"" for example, you've had a major fight within your arch nemesis & for once he's on the floor unconscious - now is your chance -finally! - so what do you do - would you a) pick up the gun on the floor and take the 2 seconds to shoot that person, or b) leave & then come back later..... let me see now...

Let me give you another example - you are a Dr, and the former most dangerous man in the world, who you know murdered countless people & almost brought the city to the edge of destruction, comes to visit - but you find out he's lost all his powers. He ""thinks"" you can help him get these powers back with an injection, do you a) give him the injection - knowing he'll probably be unstoppable & continue to murder his way through humanity, or do you b) give him an injection of something like saline, or even better some sort of poison - which he wouldn't have known you were doing as he had no medical knowledge??? Again, let me think....

Too many moments like this made it silly and unbelievable, which is a shame...."
"I just watched this today (recorded it from last night) and quite honestly, I'm pleasantly surprised. I was convinced the hype machine would kill this show, building up expectations so high they could never be met, but Heroes has measured up nicely, hitting on all marks in my book. I'm as a huge a 24 and House fan as is out there, but Heroes may have just taken TV's top billing in one night.

I must admit, shows now-a-days tend to go down hill after the pilot, but NBC's latest offering seems to have set itself up with a concept and tone that could carry on strong, at least for a season. My initial reaction was that we would either see clichéd super hero garb or some awkward NBC drama soaked in hero juice. What we got instead was a surprisingly good pilot that brought enough ""hero material"" to live up to its name, but not too much as to make us think we were watching an X-men ripoff.

The writing and the interweaving plot and characters is compelling and interesting, nothing dumbed down, but nothing contrived either. The direction fits the concept perfectly, it grabs you as much as it should, without being distracting. The acting is most surprising in that it's actually good. Masi Oka, who plays ""Hiro Nakamura"", is quite possibly the best of the cast, though he never speaks a word of English (unless you count ""Spock""). Overall the cast is nothing big on paper, but they all manage to hit their marks well.

Last but not least, there were some pop culture references and nods to comic book lore that just made me smile. There seems to be a very cool hero/comic book hip feel that makes you trust the writers on this one.

Again, shows have been known to start strong and fall off soon after, but in this case, Heroes has made a strong enough showing that everyone should check this out."
"Heroes, in this writers opinion, is probably the most compelling pilot I've seen this year. Yeah there's ""traveler"" ""Jericho"" ""Kidnapped""... they were good, but nothing that wasn't predictable. I must give credit to ""Tim Kring"" the creator of this series much credit for not treating the viewers like idiots. Superhero TV shows always have tendency to be wannabee big-budget Jr. movies. ""Heroes"" will have none of that! From reading the outline one would an expect ""X-men"" rip-off. Such is not the case for ""Heroes."" It is completely original in it's presentation. It would be a crime for me to give away plot details. I just hope the rest of the series continues to be this smart.By the way, it's nice to see ""Ali Larter"" given a provocative role like the the one she plays in this series, that's demonstrates her range as an actress. Kudos to all involved! Now only if NBC gives this darn show a friggin' chance!"
"Heroes is one of the most controversial shows of the decade, but not for the reasons you may think. When Heroes premiered, it was one of the most popular shows on television. Fanboys were created around the world, but disaster struck: Heroes, for reasons unknown, started to suck after a wonderful first volume. Fanboys were in denial everywhere: Was their precious Heroes really going down the drain, or was it just a hiccup? People expected old Heroes to come back when volume three came to us, and.... Heroes was awful. People stopped watching, but as they stopped, the old Heroes we loved slowly came back in volume four. Now the show is in volume five, and did the show returned to form? Read on...

VOLUME ONE: GENESIS - Here's the thing about Heroes: Instead of having ""seasons"" like normal TV shows, it has ""volumes"" to be more like comic books. Volume One is where everything starts. In it the Heroes must stop a nuclear bomb from exploding in NYC, but all of the Heroes are scattered around the world and none of them except one knows about it. We're introduced to the main cast that has remained with us up until recently. The best part about superhero stories has often been said to be the ""discovery"" phase, and the whole first season is devoted to that. As the volume progressed, the characters become more accustomed to their powers, showing the natural stages of average Joe to superman. The magic of real people having superpowers captivated the world. The only major downside to this volume was the average finale. People expected a grand finish for the volume, but one wasn't delivered. Maybe I wasn't disappointed because I watched this volume after the fact, but fans were just plain angry. Despite the sub par finale, expectations still soared for volume two...

VOLUME TWO: GENERATIONS - Volume Two dealt with heroes from the past, and the heroes also had to stop a virus from being released. Sounds exciting... at least on paper. In execution however, this volume was horrible. Nothing happened in the first 4 episodes. It was BORING. These people have superpowers, but they aren't doing anything. Things started to pick up, but none of it seemed to be planned out. As the volume started to be interesting, the volume was cut short due to the writer's strike. What we're left with is a boring mess that made fans want to tare their hair out. Tim Kring apologized for the show's 180 degree turn in quality. Fans laid the blame on the writer's strike, so expectations soared yet again for volume three...

VOLUME THREE: VILLAINS - Volume three had the heroes trying to stop a formula which gives normal people superpowers from being mass produced, and would therefore destroy the world. This season started out by introducing new characters to us and created exciting new twists that should have been awesome. After the premier though, things started to suck. Instead of things being too slow now, they were too fast. Random things were happening left and right, the plot was spinning out of control, and fans everywhere gave up on the show. Thankfully, this volume was only half the season, and Heroes then segued into volume four...

VOLUME FOUR: FUGITIVES - After the events in volume three, the show rightfully decided to ignore most of volumes two and three. This volume had the heroes on the run from the US government. After the madness of the last two volumes, people had given up on the show. Something happened which I started calling the ""Heroes effect"". The Heroes effect is this logic: The last two volumes of Heroes were so awful that Heroes is bad forever no matter what. This of course is not true. With this volume, the plot slowed down and the heroes started doing rational things. We started to actually care for them again, and they did things logically again. The magic of the show started to return, but by this point there were only about 10 people left who cared enough to notice. The volume also slowly drifted away from most of the show's usual tropes, and fans started to actually look forward to next week's episode. With Heroes starting to get back on track, we now have the current volume...

VOLUME FIVE: REDEMPTION - This volume, aptly titled ""Redemption"", shows how the writers have learned from their mistakes. The cast aren't bouncing off the walls like in Volume Three, but they aren't sleeping like in Volume Two. The heroes did things we can relate to again, the new villains this round were the most interesting since the first volume, and most of the stuff they did was logical. It started off a bit slow, but takes off with episode 4. After that most of the episodes were awesome up until episode 12; then the volume became really boring. Almost Volume 2 boring. It kills all of the momentum it built up. It's like this for a while, but then the last 4 episodes are fantastic. This volume, unlike all of the others, actually has a satisfying ending. If it didn't have those really slow episodes in the middle, Volume Five would be just as good as Volume One. It's certainly more entertaining than the previous three volumes.

Looking back, it's a miracle how the show got back on track. Heroes promised so much in volume one, but didn't deliver any of it. Heroes had fallen so far that the turn around in quality doesn't even matter now. Most people who watched the show are now biased against it, and the ratings are so low that the show's future is in doubt. Luckily NBC's ratings suck this season, and Heroes is still one of its better performing shows, so Heroes might get lucky.

If you plan to watch Heroes for the first time, skip volumes two and three. They'll make your brain hurt."
"Although the show's concept is sort of a ripoff of the X-Men concept of people evolving to have super powers, I have to admit it was enjoyable. The acting was all very well done as were the slices of life that introduced you to each character. The effects are kept very low-key making it more believable than the typical super hero show. There is a great underlying darkness that permeates as well, giving one the feeling that some very bad things are about to happen. My mom even liked it, and she usually just sticks to shows about cops and politics (like West Wing, Law & Order, and CSI). If you haven't seen it give it a try. It's a very good show so far and only promises to get better.

I will definitely be tuning in for the next episode myself."
"Season One was excellent, but the writer's strike Mid-Season Two made for a clumsy unanticipated finale. Unfortunately, the series suffered as a result and never fully recovered with many writing inconsistencies that followed. My rating reflects the goodwill and potential based on the first season and took -1 per season that followed."
"Like ""Lost"" they also have a habit of bringing up questions without giving you answers but hopefully that will change as the series goes along. The actors/actresses are very good at what roles they have and I for one am already hooked.

The main characters are individuals that are just discovering their super-human abilities and as the show progresses you are given the feeling that these individuals will be coming together and assisting one another to prevent major catastrophes from occurring. A scientist's son is picking up where his father's research left off and knows these folks are out there and are important to the world.

The second show has some gruesome spots (not a spoiler) so this may not be one for the ""kiddies"". It does have a great deal of intrigue and hopefully won't leave you with a feeling of being left out on a limb. I am interested in how the sub-plots will all come together."
"I have to agree with another reviewer that wrote that the show starts off good. I have to disagree with the notion of only rating and reviewing a show based on a couple of episodes or even just one season. You have to see the whole package. Something that is also true of our heroes on display here. The variety at the beginning is something that is great to see.

The fact it gets predictable and jumps the shark quite early (even season 2 one might say). There are too many coincidences, too many convinient things happening, too predictable, too much hoping and giving the viewers all the characters almost all the time. And then there are character developments that are just plain ... well not good to say the least. Flipping and switching to serve a narrative or artificially heighten the tension.

You may accuse me of being too harsh and you may not care for some of those things. But I am laying them out there for you, not that they are hard to spot. So it is up to you to decide what weight you see in certain things and what matters most to you. I always follow through with watching stuff, even when I lose interest. But I want to able to know where something is going ... clearly the makers didn't think the last season here, would actually be the last season. I have not researched but there may be a continuation in comic books, something Buffy and Angel did for example. Whatever the case, it will leave you with an uneven feeling ..."
"This must by far be the worst butchering of a TV series ever. It is almost impressive how they totally trash a tremendous show along the way until only a burning wreck remains. The writers responsible should quit their jobs and live in shame for the rest of their lives. This is a painful display of inconsistency and incompetent writing. I was actually excited when I heard about ""heroes reborn"" but now that I have just finished s4 I am not so sure anymore. Maybe I will watch it out of pure curiosity and I am telling myself that it can not get any worse. This show desperately needs Hiro to go back to the start of s2 and bitchslap everyone around the writingtable."
The Following really is a pretty underrated show. It stars Kevin Bacon and James Purefoy who are both really good actors and are fantastic in this. It's a great thriller from beginning to end. The first season is the best but the other two are still worth watching. I actually think it had another season left in it but I guess they wanted to end it before the quality dropped too much. Each episode ends with you wanting more so this is a show that's good to binge. Admittedly some of the story is ridiculous but if you can just turn off your brain and just enjoy it for what it is then I promise you'll have a good time watching this.
"I have to say I really enjoyed The Following more than I though I would. It follows FBI agent Ryan Hardy (Kevin Bacon) as he chases notorious serial killer Joe Carroll (James Purefoy) who escaped death row. Hardy is the one who originally caught Carroll after he killed 14 women. While Carroll was in prison he developed a cult of his followers who will go to any lengths to prove themselves to him and that included murder, abductions, sacrificing themselves, etc. This is an edge of your seat cat and mouse series that's definitely worth a watch. It might have gone a season too much but even that last season is a decent watch."
"Review of Season One:

I'll make it clear now that I'm not a fan of Kevin Williamson. I know the guy made his name writing SCREAM and I KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER, but I find his writing style immature and slapdash, relying on coincidence and contrivance. It rings hollow for me, so that people like Craven can make excellent films of his work is a surprise.

THE FOLLOWING is a serial killer thriller written and created by Williamson, but to my surprise I didn't hate it. It's heavily flawed, with many episodes featuring characters who do dumb things, but on the other hand it's well acted and fast-paced, so that you never have time to dwell on the shortcomings.

I know Kevin Bacon is an ubiquitous actor these days but he's very good as the flawed hero character here. The scene-stealer, of course, is James Purefoy, as the Messianic serial killer who inspires a cult following. As a lover of Gothic literature, I enjoyed all the Poe references, and there's so much incident that this is hard not to enjoy. THE FOLLOWING suffers from being a bit back-and-forth-ish in the narrative and having poorly written (and annoying) female characters, but I liked it enough to want to check out the second series.

Review of Season Two:

The good news is that Season 2 of THE FOLLOWING is a definite step up in quality from the first series. This is much faster paced, more involving, and has a lot more action and incident to keep it moving along quickly. The various sub-plots are also a lot more interesting and the annoying characters like Emma and Claire are either not as annoying or get far less screen time.

The plot kicks off from the get go with the addition of new, rival serial killers who pick up where Joe Carroll left off. The twins are great characters and bring the screen to life whenever they're around. This is one of the stabbiest shows I've ever seen, with multiple knifings seemingly every episode, although it's not excessively gory.

Bacon feels more assured in his performance here, more world-weary, and definitely more human. Jessica Stroup is a great addition to the cast, but best of all is the returning James Purefoy, who's given time to really flesh out his character and even make him likable on occasion. He's the best thing in this and the writers know it, giving him all of the finest moments. The last episode of the series is particularly well written, giving us an unexpected plot development, but overall it's the superior quality of the writing throughout the season that makes this so enjoyable.

Review of Season Three:

So, here we have the final season of the show. It's a step down from the last series and the reason for that is that James Purefoy's character takes a back seat here. Instead we get some returning killers and a whole bunch of new ones, none of whom have as much as impact as the ones depicted previously.

There's a definite sense of repetition in the show by now with lots of near-misses and the constant escape of characters being more than a little wearying. THE FOLLOWING still keeps you watching with some very dark elements in the script but I did feel it was going through the motions at other times.

Still, every scene involving Purefoy is very good, and the pacing is a lot faster than in the first series, which makes this superior to that. I have to say that it does feel like it finishes in the right place and anything more would probably have driven it into the ground."
"The show started well, good original storyline and a great turn by James Purefoy as baddy Joe Carrol.

Sadly the show quickly went down hill. Key stone cops quite literally. Highly trained FBI agents who cannot shoot baddies from close range and constantly get out witted.

This could have been excellent."
Started well but got tiresome after a while. Seemed like twists for the sake of twists. Gave up during Season 2.
"This new television show is well written and brilliantly acted. I am thrilled to see something on the air that actually promotes thought. Unlike reality TV, this show has twists and turns that will catch the viewer totally by surprise. As a former literature major, I loved reading Edgar Allen Poe. This show will surely bring back an interest in his works. So kudos to the writers for actually being intelligent and my hope is that viewers will be challenged and continue to tune in. I know that I have had my share of mindless television and look forward to seeing another episode of ""The Following"" next Monday night. I guess you could say that I am a ""Following"" follower. Now, how about setting up a Facebook page so we can Share, Share, Share...? *smile*"
"I'm going to make this special - 2 reviews in 1. The first will be about the actual series and the second about, well.. idiots.

First thing's first. It's certainly a great start - and I'm not talking just about the good, tragic, dramatic plot but the cast too. We all know that having Kevin Bacon in a movie is a great plus but having James Purefoy as the charismatic serial killer is absolutely amazing. The characters fit on Kevin and James like a glove and they, developing a ""nemesis relation"" really highlight one another.

The start of the series was off the charts, it was action filled, in a word - extraordinary! Half way through it, I immediately asked myself: How can they keep this up for at least a season?! The answer came in no time. Excellent! Now for the second part of the review. After delighting myself with this first take on ""The Following"", I jumped back here to see how many people felt just as excited about this new series as I was. Unfortunately, I immediately saw a great deal of idiotic, so-called reviews.

I feel I have the right to call them idiots for a simple reason. Through the magic of deduction, those who complained and rated this '1' read the description (at least the one here on IMDb). Now, I ask you this: You have to be an idiot to read ""psychotic serial killer"" in the plot and expect him to plant flowers and feed the children in Somalia, right? Damn right! I urge these people to go back either to ""Lady and the Tramp"" (which was good by the way).. or to those that paid for the disgusting reviews.

Final note: This review is posted after the 1st episode and my rating is 9/10. This will probably (hopefully not) drop as we advance into the story.

GREAT START!

After season 1 addition: Americans / Brits.. if you feel your cops are smarter than this, then.. you've been fooled by all the Sherlock Holmes movies. They are damn straight dumb, and they don't give a s*it about you.. just like in The Following."
"The writing was good creating tension and setting the scene for following episodes. The play between Kevin Bacon's character as the flawed former FBI agent and James Purefoy as the serial killer is excellent. Purefoy's character is both frightening and compelling fleshing out a complex character that plays well against Kevin Bacon's powerful portrayal as the former FBI agent. Good first start. Similar to the FBI character in The Red Dragon, Bacon is struggling to come to terms with his experience with the killer. The supporting characters are also very good and there are enough twists and turns to satisfy most of those who like thrillers. The one flaw is that in a one hours time limit the end became a bit predictable. However, this is forgivable because of the quality of the writing. It leaves enough hanging to compel me to watch the next episode."
"At this writing, The Following is rated 7.7, but most of the reviews are very negative. How can that be? Personally, I find many of the criticisms of this show undeserved.

The Following is not for everyone. It is a very dark and violent tale that takes gore to a new level.

This crime drama is a two-character dance between Joe Carroll, a college professor who turns his academic expertise about E. A. Poe into a cult-driven real life tale of murder, and Ryan Hardy, the object of Carroll's rampage. Both men are intelligent. Like Holmes and Moriarty, they duel in the darkness.

Both men are obsessed. Ryan Hardy (Kevin Bacon) is an alcoholic, plagued by guilt. In the end, he is addicted to Carroll, like Ahab to the white whale. Joe Carroll (James Purefoy) is obsessed with the story he has plotted and cast Hardy in as the tragic hero.

The Following is, really, a horror story. As such, one should recognize the basics of the genre and not disparage them. The surprises hidden in the darkness. The character who, against all good judgment, investigates the shadows. The actor who is compelled to go it alone when reinforcements are advisable.

As a horror story, The Following gives us a worthy villain who, via his army of minions who can be as scary as zombies, terrorizes with an uncanny ability to strike at will.

The Following plumbs the depths of insanity and obsession. Not everyone will want to go there, but the story is literate and the chills are frequent."
"After watching the series premiere of ""The Following"", it left me with an impression that I simply couldn't find anywhere else as the story unfolded in such a terrifying way. Although some may complain that it moves by a little too fast(which I admit at times it did), that's only a small qualm as the performances and main plot make up for it with various twists and turns throughout the story. Kevin Bacon was simply incredible as the worn down FBI agent with a tragic past that has yet to be explored further as the show progresses, but James Purefoy is MARVELOUS as the twisted serial killer. With his manic stare and smile, you're not really sure as to his true motives. This makes him more dimensional yet at the same time diabolically and devilishly sinister; playing mind games with the protagonist with his schemes of mass murder and mayhem. Purefoy is a beast of a man that no one wants to mess with.

""The Following"" is one to watch. I'll be tuning in to the next episode to see how twisted and horrifying the world will be in the eyes of the hero and villain in a battle against good and evil. If the quality of this show keeps up, I'd expect more seasons."
"I cannot recommend this show highly enough. The writing is fantastic, the characters are well rounded and multi-layered. In my opinion, it had a very ""Se7en"" vibe to it. Kevin Bacon is perfect as the damaged FBI agent on the trail. His team are well put together and diverse. I always enjoy seeing Shawn Ashmore and he's going to do well as your newbie agent trying to prove himself. Purefoy is a dream as our main serial killer - leader. He's charismatic, good looking and completely screwed up in the head. The show is gritty, but not ridiculously so. It's violent and bloody, very scary. You know from the beginning who the main killer is, but seeing how he manipulates his followers is fascinating, and you won't know who they are until the show wants you to. I can't wait to see where it's going."
"It's unusual for me to like a procedural show, but The Following has a combination of things that makes it something that I look forward to watching each week.

One of the best (if not the best) thing about the show is James Purefoy as Joe the villain. He doesn't overplay the character, and he manages to be creepy and a bit charming all at the same time, making it hard to avoid the urge to root for him even as I wonder why he's not in a higher security facility (because he's clever and smart and deadly).

Kevin Bacon was definitely the right choice for Ryan the hero. He looks great, he acts great, and he and Purefoy have excellent chemistry on screen. It makes me wish we could see more of them being amicable with one another (like in a couple flashbacks).

The rest of the cast is good, too. I like the lead agent woman, the younger boy agent, and I'm strangely drawn in by the bizarre love triangle between Joe's followers Paul, Will and Emma. It's crazy but interesting, and I'll be sad when they ax that plot line.

Overall, I think it's interesting and entertaining. And I think the season only has 12 episodes, so they aren't as likely to get bogged down with filler episodes (as is wont to happen with many shows). I look forward to watching more of it."
"As a 21st century viewer I, of course, just had to come look if everybody loves this show as much as I do.... Disappointed much? But that is when I realized that this show has been wildly misunderstood by SO many people.

The first thing that makes this show so amazing is its cast; where I would think that Bacon would make a better villain than Purefoy, this show just pulls the rug from under you by making your favorite professor and dear father and husband, a manic serial killer with an Edgar Allan Poe obsession. Bacon, on the other hand, who I thought would never be more than 1984 Ren McCormack, becomes the resident hottie and troubled good-guy. Other stunning performances include the Elektra-complexed Valorie Curry and the not-meant-to-be-a-follower Warren Kole.

I have watched (not battled as some users have stated) and thoroughly enjoyed every realistic (yes, I think it is very believable) moment of this intensely complicated show. Therefore I think it is also just fair to note how brilliantly this show is written! Kevin Williamson, who also brought us The Vampire Diaries (which I don't think is believable, by the way), Scream and I Know What You Did Last Summer, to me, showed with this series his true talents as an immensely talented horror-writer capable of reaching places in the human psyche that is not very often reached in post-modern television.

Bravo! With an amazing show, cannot wait to see what the final will bring..."
"Okay so I am reading all these reviews about how bad the plot/story line is, I for one don't understand all the bad reviews???? It's a weekly TV show its not some grand movie that is suppose to have a start and finish its a weekly TV show that's suppose to continue on and on and if you think about cults like Waco and militias like Ruby Ridge well Law enforcement isn't always the most competent and these cult leaders do set up camp right under our noses so its just not that far fetched, look how long Bundy killed before getting caught, but this is from someone who liked Criminal Minds I tend to like shows that get into the criminal psyche. Kevin Bacon is superb and James Purefoy looks like he is having a great time playing this charismatic psychopathy. Lighten up watch this for the entertainment that is a weekly TV show its not meant to be the next great movie of the century that's what Captain Phillips, American Hustle or 12 years a slave is for."
"Forget bad reviews. This is as most say, a great show. I was hooked all the way through all 3 seasons. Kevin Williamson is personaly my favourite writer and a true inspiration. The twists and turns make for a thrilling ride. Unfortunately it wasnt reniewed for a 4th season so as with most cancelled shows you don't get full closure so be prepared for that. The cast are phenominal. If you are familiar with Kevin Williamsons work you will know he has a way of keeping you on your toes and guessing all the way through, questioning ever characters motives and truth. Kevin Bacon and the guy who plays Joe give excellent performances with true depth but that could be said for everyone. There is not one weak link in the line up. So gutted its over to soon."
"They tried to sell this as a serial-killer-of-the-week series but it's nothing of the sort.

The first third of The Following is actually pretty interesting. You have people committing suicides or killings with a message and the FBI is trying to figure out what is going on.

What is going on is that a former literature professor named Joe Carroll, now imprisoned, somehow managed to create a following of lunatics ready to kill and/or be killed for him/his ideas. His ideas amount to a bunch of self-help yet self-destructive pronouncements on life, death, beauty and E.A. Poe-inspired imagery. What Carroll is after is a reunion with his wife and son and to write his reality-based masterpiece.

The FBI reluctantly recruits a reluctant disgraced former agent, Ryan Hardy, who was responsible for the investigation that put Carroll in jail in the first place- since Carroll was a serial killer himself.

And at first things are interesting and mysterious. But once Carroll gets what he wants and plays hide-and-seek with the FBI, things go downhill fast. And the inevitable confrontation between the good guy and the bad guy is anything but the mind blowing ending they promised. Sure, the final outcome is unusual, but nothing to rave about.

The Following should have been a strong series, it looks like it has a budget, cast, crew and some interesting ideas. But put together it doesn't work. James Purefoy's villain is terrible. There's the obligatory British accent, because you know, he's a professor and really smart, so he's got to be British. But his delivery of that accent is awful. His character is supposed to be super charismatic, he manages to get a bunch of people to die for him, yet Purefoy just can't convey an ounce of that supposed charisma. He's awfully dull, slow, lethargic, lame, and not at all brilliant.

But it's not just Purfoy's acting that is off. It's almost everyone else's too. Most actors are giving us their B or C game here, including the likable Shawn Ashmore, who makes a good sidekick to Hardy. The exception here are Bacon and Zea, who give truly outstanding performances and whose characters are the only compelling thing The Following. But they can't save the series from all its other faults.

Casting isn't convincing either. What is it that casting directors see in Annie Parisse? I didn't care for her in Person of Interest, nor in this. She did act a whole lot better in Person of Interest though. Then there's another secondary villain, in the person of the tiny Valorie Curry with a boy's haircut. Hollywood insist on this fantasy of minuscule anorexic females beating up on big guys.

Then there's the routine in which the series eventually settles. And that is that the bad guys are in constant god mode. They are everywhere, know everything, are always several steps ahead of the FBI, in fact, for every one step forward the FBI takes they end up taking two steps back- in each episode. Law enforcement has some goofy spanking new uniforms, but they are astonishingly clueless. Granted, the Boston events took place while the series had already been filmed I presume, but it doesn't take much of an imagination to figure that a post-9/11 manhunt for an escaped serial killer and his killer cult followers wouldn't look anything like the pathetic amateur operation shown on The Following. As a viewer rooting for the good guys, this show doesn't give you any reason to tune in to the next episode. You have one smart guy and a bunch of bozos going after an omniscient genius with an army of competent followers who are everywhere.

Some other annoyances I found, the whole big fuss made about homosexuality/bisexuality, which I guess is now mandatory in Hollywood but doesn't amount to anything in the end in this show. If crazy cultist killers aren't bad enough, you get crazy cultist killers who are of course militia members, too. I guess Kevin Williamson never really outgrew the 90s.

I finished watching this season just to see how it all turns out, not so much because I was compelled by its greatness. The Following could have been an edgy fascinating show, but instead it settled for widespread mediocrity."
"After FOX canceled Alcatraz last year, I was worried it was becoming a cheesy sellout channel only known for Glee and American Idol. When I saw ads for The Following, I was pleasantly surprised. Kevin Bacon puts a new twist on the classic ""dark hero"" and with an all-star cast of seasoned actors who blend beautifully, it's almost believable. I was on the edge of my seat as I watched the first two episodes and I am looking forward to a wonderful series. The antagonist Joe Carroll is a horrifyingly perfect Moriarty to Ryan's Holmes and he reminds me a bit of Ben Linus from LOST. Some may be turned off by the show's violence but it's mild compared to most actual horror movies, and I did not find it gratuitous. I highly recommend this new series."
"If only the writers would inject more realism... do more research on how law enforcement really operates in the field; the show could be so much better and more believable. Instead, it plays more like a bad B movie, with the police, FBI, and other law enforcement officials looking like buffoons, screwing up at every turn, and being outwitted by a bunch of half-wits. The story itself has potential, but the writing each week gets more and more unbelievable, and I mean ""unbelievable"" in a bad way. It is a shame, especially with the stable of good actors that are in the cast. It's getting to the point that I've almost turned off the show mid way because it is becoming such a farce. To the production staff and writers...I only hope you start drinking regular instead of decaf coffee...maybe it will inject something positive into the writing and make the show a more worthy vehicle to watch. In hindsight, as a TV series, this would probably be more successful if it might spend several episodes, or even a season on one cult, then at the end of that season introduce a new cult case. I think that would allow for a logical conclusion to this case, and give longevity to the series. In addition, it would probably allow for better writing since the writers have a finite time to resolve the current cult case. Wish you luck ""The Following"", because if you don't improve by the end of the current season, you won't have much of ""A Following""."
One of my favorite action thriller tv shows I've ever seen. Don't pay attention to the harsh criticism. This show is full of action and chilling turning events that make you watch episode after episode
"If shows like, FlashForward gave us anything, it's the painful realization that a show cannot be judged by it's pilot. Good ideas can become dreadful disappointments if the writing is not up to the challenge, which, I hope won't be the case with 'The Following'. Now, I have never been a Kevin Bacon fan, and so far, I don't think much of his acting, but the story, and the main idea: ""what if there were a bunch of serial killers on the loose and they were all connected to one big crazy dude"" has a lot of potential. That alone got me hooked. But here's what I liked the most...

Being as it is that the killer is caught and thrown in jail, the interaction between him and Bacon's character sort of has a ""Silence of the Lambs"" kind of vibe that I loved. I hope they can capture that again in the upcoming episodes. So far, it looks good.

The cast looks solid, and the scripts are decently written, so I say you give this show a try, it'll be gory, but hopefully, a good addition to your TV schedule."
"A society can confine criminals but it cannot confine an idea. The criminally insane idea in this show is one held by ex-literature professor Joe Carroll (James Purefoy) that murder can be the most beautiful form of art and the ultimate form of tribute to his idol Edgar Alan Poe.

Jailed for his crimes he becomes the most grisly form of cause celebre - a serial killer with an enraptured cult of determined wackos at his beck and call. Some of them do his bidding. Others simply try to emulate his style viewing as he does murder as a form of artistic expression and imitation as sincere flattery.

Most of the points I give this show derive from the sheer boldness of its premise. They aimed high and so far they haven't missed. But the concept of this pack of people who see sense in senseless acts of violence remains shocking because it remains so puzzling.

Brilliant work by solid people! I can't wait to see where this will go next!"
"The television series Futurama is nothing short of brilliant and in my opinion is the best television series ever. I personally do not actually like science fiction movies or series aside from this one show which i give an exception too.

Futurama is easily leaps and bounds above the rest as it focuses substantially on character development and does avoid the common stereotype of ""a family"" as the focus. Instead the focuses of Futurama is simply several unique and hilarious work colleagues and there many adventures across the universe. What also is very unique is the characters are all different and each have there own opinions which provide an excellent contrast in the series. Another aspect of Futurama which surpasses other animation shows is the quality of the visuals. Futurama is notorious for having excellent visuals and has won several Emmy's for its animation achievement. The positives do not stop there; Futurama is amazing at portraying an amazing amount of emotion into the episodes that at some times had my holding back tears. This level of emotion is not even present in the Simpson's.

One final positive thing worth saying is that the show is able to appeal to all audiences, not just sci-fi lovers. For example by 50-year old mother can't stand sci-fi and she absolutely loves the show. The series itself does however contain some sexual humor that is structured rather uniquely to simply pass over young children's heads. Essentially all the sex jokes made will not be understood by the younger viewers.

Of course the show is not perfect as at it does of course have flaws. But thankfully these flaws are out shined by the brilliance of the series.

All I have to say is the biggest mistake in television history was to cancel this show, and put Family Guy back on instead of this. Conversely I am glad there are several more movies coming out which will provide the shows many fans with much more laughs. Overall I give the series a 10. One of the two television series I have ever given this too. The other being the Simpson's."
"I was so excited when I heard about new season, then I watched it, then I watched the next episode, then next and the fourth is the last one I will watch. I do not know who is writing it now but it is bad, you should stop before you ruin the whole show. This new material is like a bad rip-off of the original show that I still have on DVDs and occasionally watch.

"Futurama is probably my favourite Western animation, I first watched it because it was ""from the creator of The Simpsons"" and found myself preferring it. The style of animation is similar to that in The Simpsons although the characters look more human.

Set 1000 years in the future Futurama follows the life of Fry, a 20th century pizza delivery boy who got frozen in a cryogenics lab on New Year's Eve 1999. He awakens to find himself in a strange world where he makes friends with Bender, a kleptomaniac robot and Leela, a purple haired cyclops who is the only one of her kind on Earth. The three of them find employment with Fry's great-great-great... etc nephew, the 150 year old Professor Farnsworth. Their work for his delivery firm takes them to a variety of strange worlds although not all of their adventures are on alien planets, some involve the professor's strange inventions and others just involve them living their lives on 31st century Earth. There is also a good collection of secondary characters such as Dr Zoidberg the incompetent company doctor who is a crustacean, Zapp Brannigan, leader of the Democratic Order Of Planet's military leader who is also infatuated with Leela. The show manages to have several guest stars even though it is set centuries in the future by having the technology to keep people's heads preserved in jars, strangely this even works for people who are long dead in the present.

Like all series there are a few week episodes but these are far outnumbered by the excellent ones, most episodes will have viewers laughing and one or two might you cry. The voice actors all do a great job as do the animators."
"Futurama is the whipping boy of modern prime time cartoons. Since it was made by the creator of the Simpsons it was expected to be exactly like it. Futurama had its own brand of comedic flair, which is absolutely hilarious. Bender, Fry, Leela, Hermes, Zoidberg, all of these characters are well thought out and work incredibly well together, on top of the fact that situations and anecdotes from previous episodes are brought up all the time, adding continuity to an already excellent series. I'll admit that I too was among the people crying foul when Futurama first came out, I didn't grow to truly appreciate it until it was put in syndication on adult swim, and more so later as I bought all the episodes on DVD. I don't think the world was ready for what futurama had to offer when it first came out, and everyone should give it another shot through adult swim or by DVD rental. It has solid entertainment value, and a unique comedic style.

4.5 out of 5 stars"
"Now that is not to say the Simpsons is bad or anything, I really like it, but it has jumped the shark for a few years now. Futurama is everything I love an animated series to be, funny, original and witty. I seriously don't know where to begin praising the show. Well for one thing the animation is amazing. The characters are really well drawn, the backgrounds are audacious and the visual effects are eye-popping. And the music is brilliant, it is cleverly composed with some funky songs featuring such as ""Conga"" and ""Sunshine of Your Love"" and the theme tune is definitely memorable. The writing is outstanding, the comedy works brilliantly and the more touching and subtle parts work just as well. The episode ideas springing from a brilliant concept are really original and fun, and the pacing is great. And the characters with the help of a truly talented voice cast are really unique and endearing, especially Fry, Bender and Zoidberg, and Leela is a feisty and headstrong character that I related to immediately. Overall, a truly wonderful show, with all the fun and originality that are lacking in the later episodes of the Simpsons. 10/10 Bethany Cox"
This show is so brilliant you don't deserve to watch it.
"Futurama is an absolutely hilarious show. The jokes are great and the characters are unique. Fry's stupidity is hilarious. Bender is great. The professor says some really funny stuff, especially the insults he comes up with. The whole show is an entertaining, comic masterpiece. I was actually pretty surprised at how good the last season was. My girlfriend and I thoroughly enjoyed it. I'm deeply saddened that this show is canceled.. Again!! It's better than a couple of the adult animated series that are still running on Sunday nights. The last season was so funny that it made us even more confused that it's being canceled. How is this happening when some other terrible junk is still on the air?? It's a brilliant show. The creators did an excellent job and I'd love to thank them for this. It's worth watching again and again! I will miss seeing new episodes."
"This show has always been ignored, or passed over by some old Simpson's fans, simply because it isn't the Simpsons.

Futurama and the Simpsons share little in common, aside from one thing...they are both extremely funny. Futurama however, continues to push the envelope of what is entertaining. With an extremely amusing cast of characters, plot lines, laugh out loud jokes and even some emotional moments, this show has everything. Adventure, Comedy and Romance can all be found within the cornucopia of episodes this show has to offer.

In the Simpson, the quality has gone downhill and has kept going further and further down. In Futurama it is the exact opposite. It just gets better and better and better.

Anyone can enjoy Futurama as it is full of smart laughs, slapstick humour, and great characters. I give this show ten out of ten. If you enjoy The Simpson's, Star Wars, or anything else, this show is perfect for you."
"One of kind anime show. I don't feel ashamed to say I have watched it about 5 times already and I will keep watching it, because there is no modern day match for the enjoyment and the quality of the fun stories of the world of tomorrow- Futurama! Shows like Rick &Morty are mere shadows of the popular culture, while Futurama is popular culture of itself, is original in it's majority."
"Futurama is one of my all time favorite cartoon series. Never gets old. This show is so smart and funny. Why FOX ever canceled this show is beyond me.

Instead they have crappy programs like that lie detector game show and other lame junk.

Adult Swim was dumb for no longer having Futurama in its nightly line up. It is the only reason I watched it. As far as it being on Comedy Central, at least it is still on the air. As much as I love The Simpsons I can actually say I like Futurama more. Looking at all the nominations and wins the series received while on the air with FOX just proves how dumb FOX was to cancel the show.

WHAT WERE THEY THINKING?

They brought back Family Guy. Why doesn't FOX and Matt Groening bring back Futurama?"
"I still laugh watching old episodes but the newest season is real cringe. The characters are watered down or something. Its especially noticeable observing Bender being really boring now. I dont know why they made this to Futurama but its really sad this being a cult classic until now. Its like the bloating and money grabbing has affected every show available. Dont get me wrong its ok but when you dont laugh or feel excited to watch more episodes there is something definitley wrong. Id rather see this series end before these new additional episodes ending in a high note. Unfortunately this is another show that isnt excellent anymore, just average."
"I love Futurama. It's a great adult animation, very rewatchable and fun. My issue is the reboot episodes don't really feel true to the show. Maybe I'm just judging them too harshly, but they aren't as good as the old episodes.

I really like Fry, he's a solid dumb and loveable main character. Bender is a good sarcastic evilish best friend. And then Leela is the voice of reason character that keeps the others in line. I feel like this main trio has a pretty solid comedic group archetype. Using a trio of main characters with these base personalities can and does lead to lots of comedic possibilities."
"man, this show was freaking awesome, so of course it got canned. it was funny, had great characters, wonderful dialouge and was way too good for TV. In fact, at times I find myself enjoying this show more then the simpsons. I find myself enjoying the antics of the characters more. so if i had to choose i would say this is more entertaining then the simpsons. although the simpsons had more better side characters (although zapp brannagin and his alien sidekick are friggin hilarious) in the end, i would advise anyone looking for a laugh to catch reruns whenever you can or buy the dvds. I don't think you'll be disappointed. a wonderful show canned way too soon."
"This is the best science fiction show I have seen. It combines all sorts of science fiction settings, technologies and tropes with a cast of lovable characters. The stories are all memorable and often get quite emotional. Futurama combines comedic satire with heartfelt plots and is overall a great series."
"As most of us know, Futurama is a really, really funny show, and every character has something special about them. There is nothing wrong with this show at all! I don't see any flaws, and I don't care if there are any. This is a show with a truly touching and hilarious story line.

The show is about Phillip J. Fry, a 25 year old pizza man who gets frozen in a test tube in a New York City lab on December 31, 1999. Poor Fry accidentally falls into the tube and can't get out. He is finally unthawed on December 31, 2999, exactly 1000 years later. He gets out of the tube and is mortified with what he sees, and at the same time, ecstatic. He hated his job as a pizza boy, which is what he did that for a living. When he came out of the tube, he meets Turanga Leela, another major character. Leela is quite obnoxious and has a quick temper, but some good comes out of her. Then Fry meets Bender, the slam-bang funniest character on the show! His trademark quote used in almost all episodes is 'Bite my shiny metal ass.', and no one says anything. Fry then becomes enrolled in Planet Express, a delivery crew in the year 3000 with Leela and Bender. The head of the Planet Express is Hubert J. Farnsworth, a 160 year old man. Well, it is a cartoon. At times, he's unbearable. Hubert is Fry's great x30 (the word great is used 30 times) nephew, making Fry actually older than his 160 year old nephew. The other three people who work at the Planet Express are Hermes Conrad, Amy Wong, a woman actually from the planet Mars, and then John Zoidberg, a hilarious human sized lobster. He has two giant claws that are sharp and used a lot to open food. Fry, Leela, and Bender are the crew who go on hilarious missions in outer space with the company spaceship. This show is anything but bad!

Futurama has a truly touching and hilarious storyline. I cried tears of joy in one episode, I remember. If you don't like the show, that's sort of okay with me, but here's what bender will have to say: ""People who hate this show can bite my shiny metal ass."" And the show kicks ass! Be sure to look for it on DVD and Blu-ray today."
"A cartoon shouldn't give you this many feels. The ending was perfect and if you want a really good cry fest, go watch the episode about Fry's dog. I'm literally tearing up just thinking about it. Jurassic Bark should have won the Emmy that year (the episode was actually nominated and lost to the Simpsons, go look it up). There may be cartoons that are more funny, but none that are more complete."
"I have watched this show every single night for the past 8 years and I do mean every single night. It is like nothing else I've ever watched. There is something quite unique about it that makes me feel comforted. Like finally finding your people that you can be yourself. When I moved from the U. S. to Japan it provided me with something familiar that I could always go back to when life got rough. I've just watched the 1st episode of the new season and I'm so happy that they brought back most of the original production team to give that Futurama feel. You can hear how the voice actors have aged, and for me it was very special to hear. Like I have been there with them the entire time just waiting for their return. I always imagined what new episodes would be like but now I don't have to. Thank you for bringing this treasured show back!"
"I grew up with the Simpson's, and here Matt proved he's no one hit wonder with a long standing show that is somehow better than his first creation.

Every episode is brilliant, some more so than others, but it's entirely watchable from start to finish in practically any order. Such a rarity in tv shows.

When I have kids one day, they will have this to grow up with and that's just fantastic."
"""Futurama "" was a excellent show from the same creator of ""The Simpsons"" .Like that show ""Futurama "" had a brilliant and satirical sense of humor ,and also many references to sci-fi shows that work very well . The characters are very funny and original , And while the story advances we learn more about them .The animation is very much like ""The Simpsons "" ,but it doesn't matter ,because the stories are hilarious and unpredictable . Many of the stories work very much fro the parallels between modern events ,so the sci-fi is just a element used to make satire of contemporary events . And even if you aren't a sci -fi fan , the show still have many interesting elements that make recommend it to anybody . This was a excellent show .I can't believe that it was canceled ."
Futurama is a show that pretty good. The characters on the show are very reminiscent of the Simpsons witch is not a bad thing. Considering is made by the same guy you can suspect that. All of the characters are all pretty good and funny. It follows a nice plot. But considering that it is not as funny as classic Simpsons it does get a lower rating.
"If you got a bad taste in your mouth it's always good to take some adequate counter-measures: after watching Transformers: Earthspark (I endured two whole episodes and somehow survived that ""experience""), that new but most disappointing new show, I put on Futurama to get something good before my eyes to clean my mind and sooth my aching heart 'n' soul. Futurama, like always, delivers: it's still a most fantastic and funny show that provides tons of fun for both the young and old. What's left to say - well, we can still hope that someone someday will be able to conjure up something new and good like Futurama, till then we just have to survive."
"I loved Futurama when it was TV and I always find myself watching it on my DVD player ( I have all 4 series ). I think the thing that carries it above other cartoons ( and it's not like I don't like the Simpsons or Family Guy ) is the wonderful mix of characters. Dimwitted Phillip J. Fry, who has trouble constructing a coherent sentence and whenever he attempts to say something profound it invariably ends up flying back in his face. Turanga Leela, a outcast amongst outcasts, who when not brushing off Fry is captaining the ship between planets while wondering about her own origins. Bender, a wisecracking, gambling chain-smoking robot that is on the crew of the ship for no apparent reason apart from bumming around. Dr Zoidberg, a penniless joke of a medical practionioner that has no friends and seems to ignite hostility for just being him. Hermes Conrad, a Rastafarian bureaucrat who when not limboing for his nation is filing and shredding with an obsessive fever. Professor Hubert J. Farnsworth, whose wonderous inventions are perhaps only eclipsed by his seemingly growing amorality towards almost all living things. Amy Wong, the daughter of the rich Wong family and as such finds herself slightly naive about things that are deeper than hair gel and nail polish. Add to this the military hijinks of Zapp Brannigan and his long-suffering lieutenant Kif Croker as well as thespian robot Calculon, Warlord alien Lur and President Nixon as well as others and I think you have a group of characters that all have their own quirks and flaws to add to a very funny show.

I only hope that they have enough sense to put it back on again."
"I thought this show was so good I emailed BBC3 to thank them for airing it, and decided to write my first IMDb review.

I thought it would be a comedy going in, and it did really make me laugh at times, but it turned out to be something very different. Some of, if not THE best storytelling i've ever seen in series format. I won't say anything else because I loved how it quietly surprised me. I suspect this show might not be for everyone (I struggle to elaborate on that) but give it a go, a couple of episodes in and I was completely absorbed in this dysfunctional human tale.

Every part of this TV shows production was so well done. Fantastic acting, editing, photography if that's the right word. I really can't think of anything else like it off the top of my head.. so I would suggest watching it based on that alone and will be interested to see what the IMDb algorithm suggests people might also like in time. As it is I don't think any of the suggestions are remotely comparable. You really will miss out if you pass over this one, and at just two episodes you'll know what it's about. You won't be disappointed by the ending if you choose to keep going. It was SO well done. Everyone involved should be so proud."
"Phoebe Waller-Bridge, I don't quite know how you do it dear but keep it up. As a 50 year old bloke this should be well off the mark for me but instead I find it by far the funniest, well observed and at times poignant thing on TV at the moment. Season 2 has hit the ground running and I am hanging on for every episode. Do yourselves a favour and binge this. Thanks to all involved with the production of this series."
"I watched the first episode together with my wife and she hated it from the beginning, while I instantly loved it! This special sort of humor is always highly divisive. Either you love it or you hate it. In my experience for shows like Fleabag there's no such ratings like ""quite entertaining and funny at times""! Phoebe Waller-Bridge is incredibly talented in so many ways, I can't tell what's more adorable about her work in Fleabag: the acting, the uncommon storytelling, the firework of weird gags...? Everything is fresh and unique. I really hope there's much more coming from her in the future, both as actress and as writer!"
"I cannot say enough about how incredible this show is. I absolutely love it. I don't think I've ever watched anything more perfect. Phoebe is an incredible actress, writer, and creator. Fleabag captures the essence of a true broken heart, I've never felt more attuned with a character. I desperately wish there could have been more seasons."
"Not my typical cup of tea. Watched an episode with no intent and before I knew it I was smiling. Then laughing. Phoebe has amazing comedic talent. Even an old guy like me can recognize her talent. Quirky, irreverent, intelligent humor. Not something in abundance here in the states."
"That's a lot coming from someone who didn't cry watching ""Grave of fireflies"" and ""Miracle from cell no.7"" types of movie. The show is also really well made, great cinematography, well written and the cast is *chef's kiss. Season 1 made me cry buckets and Season 2 made me smile so much my mouth hurts. Great comfort show to revisit once in a while."
"I've rarely seen anything this funny, and there it is....half an hour of non-stop laughter.

Phoebe Waller-Bridge is hysterical as she constantly shares both her innermost and her totally superficial feelings with the audience, even while she's having sex. She is totally bizarre, as are the entire supporting cast, and they won't allow you to stop laughing.

If they can keep up the energy levels of the first two episodes, they will have a major hit on their hands.

I had such a good time watching this, and I can't wait for the next episode.

Don't pass this by. It's one of the best shows TV has to offer.

Enjoy!"
"I never give 10 stars, since I'm personally dubious of all 10 star reviews. But lately, American 'comedies' are so full of social justice and religious/political engineering, I almost forgot what it was like to laugh. Finding this show (just started season 2)--it's an anarchistic breathe of fresh air, compared to the group-think slop being shoveled into our troughs here in the US. It's been so long since I watched something designed to make me laugh, instead of control the way I think, I'm gonna give it the full 10 stars. Very excited to watch the rest of season 2!"
"After the death of her best friend, an event she is partly responsible for, a woman drowns her sorrows in one-night stands and other hedonistic behaviour. Her family compounds her problems: the uptight, corporate exec sister, the alcoholic, obnoxious brother-in-law, the well-meaning but clueless father, the scheming, domineering father's girlfriend who moved in very quickly once her mother died. From here the only way is up.

Great comedy series. Created by and starring Phoebe Waller-Bridge the series pushes the envelope in terms of humour while having decent dramatic side to it too. A great device Waller-Bridge employs is voicing her thoughts directly to the camera in between dialogue. Very original and makes for some hilarious punchlines. Season 2 then takes this a step further...

On that note, the series does improve from Season 1 to Season 2. Season 1 was a good introduction to the main character and her host of issues and was very funny but did rely a bit on shock value for some of the punchlines. It all seemed about problems (and wallowing in them) rather than solutions. I did enjoy the Boo (the deceased friend) sub-plot though. It was the most emotional part of the series, it revealed the downside to the main character's behaviour and the interactions between the two of them were always wonderfully engaging and funny.

Season 2 evolves the dramatic side and feels more balanced. There are new challenges to be faced but things are a bit less outlandish.

While the series has some aspirations as a drama its strongest suite is definitely as a comedy. A few loose ends in the dramatic sub-plots makes the dramatic side feel a bit clumsy at times.

Can't fault the casting nor performances. Phoebe Waller-Bridge is excellent in the lead role and the other major characters are superbly played."
"The story of a dysfunctional 30 year old, laid bare for the world to see.

For anyone a bit messed up by life the writer of this series wants you to reassure her she is not alone. Set in London it is a touching lesson in the bizarre, crazy and irrational things Londoners will do for some control and stability in their lives.

This series is absolutely not for the sane, it's for the sad, miserable and insane, desperately looking to feel good about themselves (and in need of a good laugh).

Undoubtedly the beginning of something great."
I liked season 1. But season 2 has stolen my heart. I absolutely adore this show.
"Fleabag is a fantastic comedy, original and refreshing in this time of mediocrity.

I have to take issue with Coral Grainger's review. The character is supposed to make you cringe. But then Coral clearly watches Miranda. If your idea of comedy is Miranda or Mrs Brown's Boys then this is not for you. This works on so many levels and is a well written, clever comedy, reliant on 3D characters, plots and life issues. This is not your run of the mill 2D canned laughter BBC comedy.

Phoebe Waller-Bridge has taken her stage show and crafted it into this well executed, acted and directed gem. It is also a triumph for female writers and the amount of feminist comment in there is not lost.

The great deal of pathos will resonate with so many people in a similar life position, and there are a lot of us out there. I guess some people's lives (Coral's) are just too perfect that she cannot disconnect and walk a mile in somebody else's shoes.

Coral also blasts the sex scenes in this 'daytime show.' I do not understand that as the show is on-line and has a guidance warning before it starts! I think that is my main point – this is a comedy which is wasted on-line. Stick to Made in Chelsea Coral. Sadly, Fleabag is far too clever for the generation who will watch it.

Fantastic, well done Phoebe."
If you don't like it no one can help you. Watch it or be the poorer
"I'm still so annoyed with BBC3 for switching to online only, I still enjoy watching the show on my lunch break at work, but it doesn't beat watching it on the box.

Fleabag is one of the best shows to come from BBC3 since the likes of Gary Tank Commander and Cuckoo. I don't get why a show like this isn't given a more prime time viewing slot, it seemed to be lost in obscurity and just deserved more.

Some of the situations obviously are a little unusual to say the least, but the writing is just so good.

Phoebe Waller-Bridge is proving herself to be an actress and writer etc of huge talents, Fleabag is genuinely funny, just as good as the recent channel four series 'Crashing' a project of hers I also loved. Olivia Colman can do no wrong, but it's nice to see her cast in a very different role, so often playing a 'sweet' character, she shows her versatility. Bill Patterson great also,"
"Fleabag is shaping up as the most over-praised, over-rated TV series of the decade - though it's a close race with Killing Eve. Yes, it's irreverent and, yes, it's funny. But 10 out of 10? C'mon! It rarely reaches the sublime heights of outrageousness of Absolutely Fabulous. In fact, it's more like a really dirty version of Miranda. Nothing wrong with that, but it's hardly hugely original. That reviewers are falling over themselves to lavish 10s and lavish praise on the series probably says more about them and their need for messy, chaotic, self-absorbed anti-heroines than at does about the series itself."
I know I'm in the minority but I found Fleabag crude and cringeworthy. The constant sexual context throughout was unfunny and the acting poor.
"Im watching it for the second time. Or is it third? Its so intelligent, witty, funny, edgy, deep.

Phoebe Waller-Bridge is spectacular. Impressive even. The supporting actors as well. Its well wrtiten, the story line is so good, and the dialogue is crispy sharp. Its funny, creative, and deep.

The one thing i do enjoy the most, is her interaction with us as the viewer. How she communicate with just a glance, a quick look, so many different meanings. Making a connection to us, almost making us, the viewer, a part of a conspiracy, the plot. Making us a complicit. Its almost a litle Richard III over all of it. I love it.

If you havent seen it yet, do it. Today.

Its pure genius."
"I started watching this after hearing all the positive reviews and awards. I watched the first 3 episodes, and was disappointed. I found it the story interesting and well produced but ultimately too sad and depressing and too much that was unliveable to be funny. I decided it just wasn't for me.

Then, a few months later I felt like giving it another whirl, partly because I've been enjoying the cracking dialogue in 'Killing Eve' and I know Phoebe Waller-Bridge was also involved in that.

I started watching where I'd left off. Perhaps it was because now I knew what to expect, or because I reached a subtle turning point in the story, but it clicked. I love it. I love the main character, and yes the story is sad, but it's also happy, and absurd, and real, and laugh-out-loud funny. I've just finished the whole thing and I thought it was perfect, a real joy.

There are plenty of reviews out there so perhaps it doesn't need another but I wanted to write this for anyone like me who doesn't get on with it at first. If you stick with it, you might find it gets better."
"I'm only just now watching this. After reading the plot description, I thought it sounded ridiculous and there would be no way to intertwine horror classic characters in one show and have it be anything other than nonsense. Boy, was I wrong. The whole thing is deeply steeped in gothic horror, but they explore many other angles and do some excellent character study. Some really great acting in here, and as mentioned repeatedly, Eva Green is just spectacular.

Be wary of the low star reviews, and notice that most of them complain of it being slow. That should tell you something right there. There's nothing slow about it unless you have the attention span of a child? I don't know, it's a ridiculous claim.

Ive seen mention of the third season being not as good, I'm deep into 2 so I may see that but it won't sway my feelings. I feel like it's a gift already!

Other shows I've loved: Kingdom, The Dark, Mindhunter."
Penny Dreadful is one of the better Supernatural/Horror TV series I've ever seen. While I have to admit that I'm not the biggest supernatural fan this hooked me from the start and kept me coming back for more until the next thing I knew I binged the entire series! Eva Green & Josh Hartnett are the stars here as they lead a pretty stellar cast! I'm glad I finally gave it a chance as should you.
I actually enjoyed Penny Dreadful much more than I thought I would. I thought it would be just another another supernatural series that's worth watching but would end up forgetting after a while. It's not. I was hooked from the start. It has so many twists and turns that it will keep you entertained through the series. It's only three seasons long but they are 3 great seasons. All three seasons are equally good. Having three seasons this show never grows stale and goes out while still interesting. Eva Green and Josh Hartnett are both fantastic actors and this is some of their best work of their careers. If you're a fan of this genre then Penny Dreadful should be a must watch for you. I promise you won't be disappointed!
"All hail to Eva Green! What an actress! If for nothing else you should see it for her. And I must say for all the other actors - bravo. The first season is amazing. I must say that I'm not overly fond of watching horror movies but this was something different. Let's say that not all episodes are horror. The combination of characters, the writing, the dark atmosphere, everything was brilliant. It is an interesting journey through characters such as Frankenstein, Dorian Grey etc. But I must go back to the acting and once again say it's a masterpiece. I really recommend this one."
"If heaven and hell are real I pray I'm forgiven for my fascination with such dark shows. Just by looking at the poster you know this is going to be something unholy. You got Frankenstein, demons, the Christian devil himself, God, vampires like Dracula and Dorian gray, werewolves, witches, and not the pretty kind, all put in a fiendish Victorian setting with a remarkable script and great cast lineup to go with it, how could you not love this show. It's heartbreaking that it only had 3 seasons but after Vanessa Ives character arc was completed it's hard imagining the show going forward despite the assemblage of characters they could have made center of the show. It just wouldn't be the same without her.

This is definitely one of my favorite shows ever, first show I ever binge watched too. I remember wanting to watch this after seeing how genius the poster is but didn't think a horror tv show could be interesting. I got S1 late afternoon on a Friday; that was when I learnt that horrors could be intellectual, not just jump scares and gory murders. By Sunday morning I was finished with the whole series, left me feeling void inside because I knew I wasn't going to find another series like it again. If you're a fan of the genre, here's a gem for you."
"Well, I'm trying to write a completely spoiler-free review here, but I guess it's safe to announce that 'Penny Dreadful' looks positively gorgeous. Great production design and cinematography: by the time we get to see Victorian London as night descends upon the city and the fog starts creeping through those narrow cobblestone alleys, nearly every frame looks like a beautiful, Gothic painting (and not once did I spot a fake looking CG-background). As far as the actors are concerned, they portray their obscure, troubled characters with a certain kind of ""theatre"" intensity that fits the story and the turn-of-the-century setting very well.

Story-wise I don't want to give away anything – but of course, there are unholy things lurking in the shadows that need to be fought (and they look rather convincing: the make-up effects are another strong point of this show). Like the iconic ""Hammer Horror"" films of old (usually starring either Christopher Lee or Peter Cushing – or both), 'Penny Dreadful' draws its setting, characters and general inspiration mainly from some famously dark tales written by Mary Shelley, Bram Stoker and Oscar Wilde (and to a lesser extent from sir Arthur Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes stories). And just like the Hammer films - who may seem rather tame now but were shockingly violent for their time - this show is neither for purists of said literary works nor for the faint of heart.

While some scenes are genuinely scary in a tension building, ""old school"" kind of way, we also get blood soaked action sequences that will probably put off some viewers, but seem entirely appropriate given the show's title (in the 19th century a ""penny dreadful"" used to be a booklet of cheap, sensational fiction printed on pulp paper which could be purchased for - wait for it: a penny).

My overall verdict: 'Penny Dreadful' dishes out a hefty mix of gory violence, classic horror creatures, sex and action, but it never forgets to build atmosphere. The B-movie elements are undeniably there, but they're deliberate (the title says it all), and this is by no means a cheap affair. Beautifully crafted and with a great cast, I strongly recommend this show to anyone who likes the old ""Hammer Horror"" movies as well as films in the vein of Tim Burton's 'Sweeney Todd' and 'Sleepy Hollow'.

But not just for the fans of ""Goth Horror"" is this well worth checking out; I would say that after 'True Detective' and perhaps 'Fargo' this is one of the most promising new TV-shows of 2014.

"Penny Dreadful doesn't get enough credit. It is a perfect show. I'm obsessed with it. I didn't find it until a couple years ago and I have already watched every season twice. I have searched for another show like this but there are none. Especially not the series to follow in the Penny Dreadful family. It is written so poetically, like a book from the same time. The sets are beautiful and capture every detail from the 19th century. Every actor played their parts perfectly, especially Eva Green. It is a dark, gothic story that is profoundly unsettling. I hope the creators can find the same magic again and create a show that is as bewitching as this."
"That's not a joke... I have literally watched the entirety of Penny Dreadful 4 times now!!!

This show is SOOOO GOOD I cannot stress it enough. Why were there only 3 seasons?? I'll never understand.

The writing, the acting, the characters, the story lines, the plot, the costumes, the effects, sent straight from heaven, or maybe hell (inside joke).

Eva Green is a gift to the screen. Vanessa Ives story is such a heartbreaking and lavish horror.

If you love horror, if you love good storytelling, if you love great television I suggest you give this show a watch.

Tread carefully though, because you might end up rewatching it every year, just as I have."
"Where do I begin? This series is in a class by itself..Cinematography and music score from the opening credits to the episodes themselves is stunning and breathtaking to behold...Someone creating this has the heart of a poet and the eye of an artist..The dialogues are Intense, deep and soul stirring and the entire collection of actors here come across the screen as Absolutely giving their All to the performances...their heart and soul emote thru the scenes like no other production ive ever seen..its that intense...Some people have said its centered around eva green, and while Noone can do possession like eva, she is electrifying and terrifying to behold, id still say that ALL, each and every actor in this series has extraordinary screen presence and bring an incredible level of realism and feeling to their roles..This is gothic horror at its best...The dialogues between John clare and eva or dr frankenstein are heartwrenching and gut moving to hear...the beauty in the soul of ""the monster"", his aching lonlieness is palpable and makes you feel for him, despite the horrors he has committed. I am loving this series, as you can surely tell..its my 2nd time watching it,as i watched it 1st when it came out and now a few yrs later im even More impressed..The opening credits and score is so beautifully done, the timing of image to music and the choice of imagery, that i find myself Wanting to watch it and listen to it...Many other shows ,one skips thru the opening credits but Not this one!...This show is Art and poetry , beauty and horror told with great depth at levels that will move ur soul...Its a treat to the senses ...It is Gothic horror storytelling at its Very Finest!"
"There are few moments in life when you get to drip and drool your eyes and ears at the same time, while your heart fights your soul reaching to understand and become a lover of evil. Rare are those moments. There may be many that do not share my perspective, nor do they taste my words and vision, but then again, I am sure that some are like me. Hungry to feel, to truly feel life, and thirsty for ambivalence, for the evil to have a good face and vice versa and more importantly to see that even flawed ones have a faith to preach and fulfil.

The story captures you entirely, it tenses your moral beliefs and makes you see a side of you which, in some cases, has never emerged, or, if it did, it will be like candy for children. The characters are immortal, at least the main cast. The way they can evolve is a tribute to the writer, director, producer and more importantly to them, as they go beyond themselves as individuals and become even more than a true character, they become immortal. Eva Green...was made for this role, or maybe the other way around... The historical aspect brings front characters of tales and stories, of mythological and biblical implications fluctuating the narrative line between the world of the living and that of the dead...or undead.

If the style of the above description matches your taste, you will most surely be enchanted by this series. If it does not...well, don't let my poor reenactment of the style be an obstacle in watching this truly magnificent piece of art.

It's more than a TV series, it's music, it's image, it's story. It's poetry."
"A fantastic series for all 3 seasons.

Brilliantly written, great use of the characters.

Epic acting!"
"After a slightly shaky start, (I think trying to encapsulate the stories of Frankenstein and his monster, Dracula, Dorian Gray, not to mention a rip-off of ""The Exorcist"", with a werewolf thrown in for good measure, might have been going a creature or two too far), ""Penny Dreadful"" turned out to be one of the year's more pleasant, as well as nastiest, surprises. Unlike the pretentious, art-house gore-fest that is ""Hannibal"" this was imaginative, fast-moving, just the right side of silly when it needed to be and intelligent, (and suitably gruesome), in just the right proportions, adhering very much to the spirit of the originals if not to their text. It was also very well acted by a decent and starry cast, (as a young Victor Frankenstein and his creature both Luke Treadaway and Rory Kinnear were outstanding while even Josh Hartnett acquitted himself quite well this time round), written and directed. For once I'm looking forward to Series Two already."
"This show has everything to make an awesome show. I was expecting a lot but after watching the first season I ended up quite disappointed. Problem is that I should have liked this show. I like this type of shows, I like Showtime shows, I like the period and the theme. I even like the main actors.

This show is strange, awkward, slow, doll, lame, boring and often quite stupid and frustrating. I was always hoping it would get better but it never did. I fell asleep many times trying to watch the whole thing. I don't get how some people can claim this is scary even a little, I've seen spiders scarier than anything in this show. Everything in this show was done better so many times...

They mix creatures like vampire, werewolf and demon and characters like Van Helsing, Frankenstein or Dorian Gray. Yet the only thing I actually found interesting was this Dorian Gray which is really just some eccentric British dude...

At first characters are interesting cause you don't know anything about them so its the mystery around their story that is interesting. Yet the more you get to know the more they become lame and boring...

There's not a lot of action and when there is some its quite ordinary, banal and lame. The main story is quite messed up, slow paced and not interesting. Again the more you understand what's going on the more you think they had nothing to say and just wanted to mix things together to make a dark Gothic show.

On a more positive note its visually awesome, the costumes, accents, scenery and everything 19th century-like is really well made. Actors are all very good. Also I like how its always dark, dark colours and dark mood. Its nice that its a very mature show for adult.

Still, if they make more of this I hope they'll come up with a story that is actually a little bit interesting... I mean, this is not asking too much..."
"The first episode of Penny Dreadful does a number of things right, making me hopeful for the future of this series.

1. The atmosphere is perfect: dense, Gothic, surreal and unsettling. The camera work is fluid and imaginative, and the grimy London settings are really well designed, almost expressionist at times. I was particularly impressed by the scenes in the gentlemen's club, shot from a high angle, and laid out in a curious Victorian grid-pattern.

2. The characters range from predictable but very welcome, to genuinely unique. Timothy Dalton is the former: a generic British adventurer, about equally suggestive of Alan Quatermain, as seen in Alan Moore's League of Extraordinary Gentlemen, and Sir Richard Francis Burton, real-life explorer extraordinaire. But the pink-haired Egyptologist is a character I've never quite seen before. His dialog is colorful, erudite and truly off-beat.

3. The dialog, now that we're on the subject, is literate and dense. This alone would make the show worth watching. There's a Victorian flamboyance about it, but also some real intellectual content. When's the last time you heard the word ""outré"" spoken by a character in a TV series?

4. The pace, the steady evolution of the plot, are a refreshing change. Too many shows are forced to rush ahead because they're not really about anything. Moment-to-moment activity is all they've got. Penny Dreadful feels like it's building up something more than that. (Time will tell.)

5. Finally, a very welcome omission: the shortage of jump-scares. There's really just one, and it's placed in such a way that it's almost a spoof of itself. Several other situations, which most shows would have exploited for a cheap shock, are handled with admirable subtlety. There is some gore, but no more than needed to establish a seriously scary tone, a sense of danger.

Penny Dreadful isn't exactly going where no entertainment has gone before. It's clearly 'inspired by' two previous efforts. Most obviously, the League of Extraordinary Gentlemen, a comic that came off rather poorly on the big screen. But also the very under-rated film Van Helsing, which brilliantly re-imagined the classic horror movies of the 1930s, but failed to find an audience perhaps because of its highly energetic style.

Penny Dreadful seems to have learned from both of these sources. Where League of Extraordinary Gentlemen was lightweight and loose with logic, Penny Dreadful is atmospheric and well-plotted. Where Van Helsing was kinetic and flamboyant, Penny Dreadful is quietly creepy.

All in all, it's off to a great start. Let's hope the producers can continue 'in the same vein.'

UPDATE: Closing in on the end of the 2nd season, my admiration for this series continues to grow. The atmosphere of Victorian menace is denser than ever. The characters more flamboyant, the dialog more poetic. I'm not sure where the story is going, or, indeed, if it needs to be headed for any specific destination, when every moment of it is so enjoyable. Rating enthusiastically unchanged: a solid 9 out of 10."
"The pilot episode was a typical getting-to-know-you episode where it introduces most of the characters and some intriguing aspects. At first, I was like, ""Oh gods above not another vampire show"" - boy, was I wrong. By the end of the second episode, I was totally hooked by Eva Green's performance alone. Just stunning work by her in the séance scene. Totally blew me away.

Don't judge a show by it's pilot. Otherwise there would be none at all.

This show is definitely not your average telling of famous stories (vampires, Dorian Gray) as it takes the most gruesome aspects of those tales and incorporates them in whatever manner suits the storyline; Penny Dreadful does not shy away from the taboo, something that has been plaguing certain stories such as Frankenstein and Dorian Gray. This show loves the grotesque and downright sinister nature of storytelling and can depend on its actors to do the job right.

I am highly intrigued by what's to come. It's gritty, filthy, and utterly captivating. I can't see love triangles or any soap opera clichés on the horizon and that makes me optimistic."
"Penny Dreadful is to horror what Game of Thrones is to fantasy and Walking Dead is to the zombie apocalypse - its all about the characters and story lines that are only possible when set in their unique universes.

This show is amazing. Everything from the sets, to the acting and directing... Eva has turned in two Emmy nomination worthy performances already.

Even if you don't like horror - go check this show out. Such a unique twist on the classics. I can't tell you how excited I am about TV right now - people are finally starting to get it... there is a market for mature, gritty, raw, and complex characters set in worlds that were once considered nerdy and childish."
"I had to add a review of this show after i saw the minority of reviews were so negative, i really can't believe that anyone would rate this series at 1/10 that is a disgrace in itself. the production values would rival most high budget movies and the acting is definitely 2 steps up from anything else horror orientated on TV( with the exception of billie piper who does an irish mish mash of accents while pulling the faces of a bulldog chewing a wasp)this however is a minor complaint, even josh hartnett pulls it out of the bag as far as the rest of the cast go. If you like your classic horror tales or goth horror then this is definitely worth checking out, i grew up watching the mummy,Dracula,the wolfman and frankenstein on late night TV and i have to say this series revisits those nights curled beneath the duvet with the class and atmosphere of the tales from which it draws it's inspiration. well worth a look guys, don't let the downers put you off!!"
"I watched when it premiered on Showtime. I watched all three seasons, and would watch them over on-demand, the night before a new episode aired. Some of the finest television I've been fortunate enough to watch.

I loved the way they did a mash up of all the literary monsters and ghouls, and made it work. Rory Kinnear is simply amazing - truly one of the best actors, ever. Eva Green is as talented as she is beautiful. Timothy Dalton is a delight every time he's on screen, and Josh Harnett make my heart beat just a bit too fast. The sets and wardrobe are lush and beautiful.

I love everything about this series!"
"We finally watched Season 3 of Penny Dreadful off the Showtime App. This storyline focuses on Vanessa Ives finally meeting the man behind her persistent super natural encounters, Dracula himself. The band will need to get back together if she has any chance of ending her suffering. We also discover how Dorian and Lily's relationship ends and Dr. Frankenstein and the Monster continue to try and find themselves. This season was by far the worst one. The delivery of who The Monster was before he became the Monster could have been delivered so much better. I did like how the storyline came full circle. That was the only storyline that at least came full circle but was still a mediocre closing. The final fight sequence and the delivery of every character's conclusion felt rushed and was unfulfilling. I was so disappointed with the final episode. I'd score this season a 6/10, Season 2 a 9/10 and season 1 a 10/10."
"Well I'll try and not reveal much however Penny Dreadful is most certainly one of the best series on our screens at the moment. It is somewhat of a slow burner at times however it absolutely burns with a restrained ferocity very much like it's actors and characters. There's a palpable energy in every performance as there is a lot of meat to each character. Everyone is an anit-hero and personally I find all the performances very engaging. Timothy Dalton radiates a commanding and duplicitous presence that matches Eva Green's which is hard to do. Even more surprising is Josh Harnett and Harry Treadaway keeping toe to toe with them both also. Billy Piper's just warming up too. I'm a veteran Horror fan and rarely have I seen such quality in feature length movies. I just watched the last in the current series and it was emotional, the trick to the P Team is that the monsters are center stage and they are very human. Rory Kinnear induces both horror and extreme pathos that very much surprises. Logan has crafted something special, something very well thought out and acted and executed in every aspect with care. The script is the only one on screen at the moment that reminds me of The Game of Thrones in the fact that every line of dialogue is loaded with meaning, coupled with the Victorian setting means that everyone is hiding something and every word is crafted. Very unusual and highly recommended, nothing is as it seems in Penny Dreadful and the characters are all the more relatable for their failings and apparent monstrousity."
"As the creators' fascination with 19th century horror literature comes to life we are introduced with a result that is part gory part calculated constraint but a pure visual pleasure. The show takes you to a setting evoking a sense of alarm under all the intrigue.This feeling is heightened by the score which is both evocative and hauntingly beautiful.

Timothy Dalton plays Sir Malcom, an explorer, who needs to bring together this group of mysterious individuals each seemingly having a secret of their own to locate his missing daughter.

Both Dalton and Josh Hartnett are reasonably good but it's Harry Treadaway and Eva Green who steal the show with their performances. Where Green can be both cold and beautiful Treadaway does an equally good job as a young Dr. Victor Frankenstein especially in the ""plant the flag on truth"" scene.

With the show currently in its initial stages much remains to be seen as to how it unfolds with so many characters (monsters??!!) to be introduced into a single plot. But as of now one thing is for sure that this show seems more about thrill and gore than horror. If that excites you then this show might be for you!"
"When you first begin this show it seems like it might not go to very great places. The stories are sometimes lackluster and the comedy doesn't always fit, but as the first season progresses and you start to learn more about the characters and the stories become more inter-woven it all actually makes sense and stands as a pretty solid first season.

As the show has continued it's aged like a fine-wine, it's got great stories with crazy twists and turns in every episode and enough great characters that you have to find someone to connect with, whether they be a hero or a villain. The acting is phenomenal, the writing gets better and better each season, and the show is always open to try new things.

Even when I expect this show to disappoint me, it doesn't. It is easily one of the most under-rated shows on television, not just in the superhero and sci-fi genre, but altogether. This show deserves the world."
"Agents of Shield was one of the best and most underrated superhero shows ever created. The first season wasn't any good so some people stopped watching which was a big mistake. I barely made it through the first season myself but if you can power through it you won't regret it. Like many people here have already said, each season gets better than the one before it. It starts off as a spin-off from The Avengers as it follows S. H. I. E. L. D. one year after that first movie and is originally part of the MCU. Then they made the incredible choice to break away and make the show their own, and that's when it gets good.! It follows a S. H. I. E. L. D. team led by Phil Coulson and the rest of his team (Daisy ""Skye"" Johnson, Melinda May, Mack, Leopold Fitz, Jemma Simmons, Grant Ward, Yo-Yo, Deke and more characters that come and go throughout the seasons). It has some of the best writing for a superhero show and some of the best characters. If you haven't seen this yet or stopped watching after that terrible first season then do yourself a favor and go watch this as soon as possible."
Agents of Shield was such a great show. If you can get past the first season (which was by far the worst season) I guarantee that you will enjoy the rest! It just took a while to gets it's footing but once it did it was one of the best shows on tv. It's one of the rare shows where every season just gets better and better! I already miss it!
"It started slowly, in season 1, but I'd heard so many positive accounts of the writing that I persevered.

Wow. It's amazing. The character development, the plot twists, the reveals, the twists and turns, the drama, the fight sequences, the effects, the acting, the whole story - it's truly awesome.

If you watched season 1 and gave up, I heartily recommend you get back to it and watch to at least season 2 and you'll be hooked. There are plenty of moments where I've laughed out loud, plenty moments where I've almost cried, plenty times when I've shouted at the screen - it's full of drama, adventure, action, suspense and even comedy.

No spoilers. Just watch it. Of all the television shows I've watched, it's definitely in the top 10, maybe even the top 5. Give it a go - if the IMDB review scores were ignored from 2013, this would be scoring a 9.0 or higher instead of the measly 7.5 it currently, undeservedly has."
"Marvel's Agents of S. H. I. E. L. D. is a thrilling and action-packed television series that takes viewers on a captivating journey through seven incredible seasons. As a fan of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, I found this show to be a fantastic addition to the larger Marvel universe, offering a fresh perspective and expanding the lore in exciting ways.

Season 1 introduces us to Agent Phil Coulson and his team of skilled agents as they investigate strange occurrences and protect the world from various threats. The plot is filled with twists and turns, and the character dynamics are well-developed, keeping me engaged from start to finish.

Season 2 continues to build upon the foundation laid in the first season, delving deeper into the characters' backstories and introducing new mysteries and adversaries. The stakes are raised, and the action becomes even more intense, leaving me eagerly awaiting each new episode.

In Season 3, the show takes a bold and unexpected turn, introducing the concept of the Inhumans and exploring the consequences of their emergence. The narrative becomes darker and more complex, and the character arcs are both compelling and emotionally charged.

Season 4 brings a fresh and innovative approach by dividing the story into three distinct story arcs: ""Ghost Rider,"" ""LMD,"" and ""Agents of Hydra."" Each arc offers a unique storyline and explores different themes, showcasing the show's versatility and creativity.

Season 5 takes the agents on a thrilling journey into space, where they face new challenges and encounter fascinating alien civilizations. The high-stakes nature of the story and the exploration of new frontiers kept me on the edge of my seat throughout the season.

Season 6 continues to push the boundaries of the show's narrative, introducing new elements and exploring the consequences of the previous season's events. The character development remains strong, and the plot twists keep the audience guessing.

Finally, Season 7 brings the series to a satisfying conclusion. The agents travel through time, encountering different eras and historical events, while also facing a formidable new enemy. This season beautifully ties up loose ends and provides closure for the characters we have grown to love over the years.

As a fan, I enjoyed all seven seasons of Marvel's Agents of S. H. I. E. L. D. The show consistently delivers compelling storytelling, well-rounded characters, and impressive visual effects. It seamlessly connects to the wider Marvel universe, with references to the movies and appearances from familiar faces, while also carving out its own unique identity.

While it is sad that the show has come to an end, it is a testament to the incredible journey it has taken us on. Marvel's Agents of S. H. I. E. L. D. has left an indelible mark on television, showcasing the power of storytelling and the impact of well-developed characters.

In conclusion, Marvel's Agents of S. H. I. E. L. D. is a must-watch for any Marvel fan or anyone who enjoys thrilling and well-crafted television. With its engaging plotlines, memorable characters, and a perfect blend of action, drama, and humor, this series will keep you entertained from the first episode to the very last. Farewell, Agents of S. H. I. E. L. D., you will be missed!"
"This show is simply amazing, it has great writing, superb acting, unpredictable storylines, deep and interesting themes, great attention to details, and amazing pacing, it's the best show when it comes to using a 22 episode season without being full of filler. The characters on this show are quite well written, they feel, talk and act like real humans , I care about all of them to some extent..in fact, I might be more invested in their lives than I am my real friends..oops! It's not only the main characters though, I often find myself really loving characters that only show up for few episodes, all the props to the writers and the cast. Now the show isn't perfect, it does take some time to gain momentum, the first season while enjoyable is rather slow compared to the rest of the show. also the show tends drop storylines or leave some things unexplained, that doesn't bother me personally, but might bother others. There is also the connections to the rest of the MCU, which some people see as not enough, others too much, and yeah it can be a bit frustrating when the crossovers you imagine don't come through, but it's not something I'd hold against this show, I think they write around the MCU well enough, all things considered. In fact, I like that the show adds a 3rd dimension to the movies, It is more interesting to me than characters showing up for a quick team up or the like."
"I had previously written a review based off of this show's first four episodes, and I gave it a 7. I felt that, as of that time, it was an average show, and that it could go either way. Most of the first eight episodes were good. A couple were great, even. But: episodes nine and ten were stellar. This series earned its 8th star.

The main characters are good. Agent Coulson, Skye, and Agent May are all very good, and, though some would disagree, I find Fitz and Simmons both likable. As for the minor characters: the people making this show aren't afraid to make up new characters, whether they're hero or villain, super- powered or non-super-powered. They already have a couple of compelling villains that are driven by more than simple greed or madness. The show's special effects are particularly good, which you might well have guessed. The show uses offshoots of classic story-lines such as Extremis. They also make references to the events happening in the Marvel Cinematic Universe at large. They are also beginning to link the events of individual episodes together very nicely. There is a good deal of mystery as to what happened to Coulson after the Battle of New York, and Skye's and May's rather ambiguous background is intriguing.

On the downside, the show contains some gratuitous content (and I'm not talking about showing blood in the action sequences or anything, I mean including things that are genuinely unnecessary). Also, some of the dialogue is a little cheesy. Additionally, some people who have seen a lot of television might find some of the plot elements predictable (although I personally don't).

Let me stress again: this show had potential, and, as of the most recent episodes, it is fulfilling it. It is truly earning its place in the MCU."
"I have to admit that I was less than thrilled with this show's beginning. I didn't think the characters were well defined and the plot seemed very lackluster.

I did continue to watch, though, and I am glad that I did.

Each week, the characters are developing and the chemistry between the actors is getting better. The writing and the quick witted dialog are classic Joss. It just took some time to work out the kinks.

The story lines are getting tighter as the show goes on. Also, as each character develops, there are questions raised that keep me coming back each week for answers.

I'm glad that I stuck with this show and gave it a chance. It is turning out to be a great ensemble action show that I hope will last a long time."
"This is an offshoot of the Marvel Cinematic Universe and sometimes an overlooked step-child of the highly successful movies. SHIELD is a global security institution tasked with protecting the earth by using superheroes and some supertech. Phil Coulson (Clark Gregg) returns from the dead to lead a small team of specialists.

The first year tries very hard to tie itself to the movies. Sometimes, it's to its own detriment. It can't help but feel inferior. Also, the movies never returned the favor which only accentuated a classic system between the two. Eventually, the TV show stops trying so hard and stakes out its own path. It does get caught up in a mess like the Inhumans but mostly there are some great season-long serials. With a few stumbles along the way, the show is able to find its own voice and its own cast of characters. They have fun adventures and even with some surprises. There are some very good years."
"I heard an awful lot of people dogging this show at its inception. I wonder if they gave up or kept watching? Because if they kept watching I don't see how they could still be hating.

The past two weeks in particular have seen me literally standing up, pointing at the TV, and yelling things at it. Sometimes all I can manage is gibberish in my excitement; things like ""What did the? Did he just? Who's gonna?"" There have been so many jaw-dropping moments here of late that I literally do not know who or what to believe.

I failed to see Captain American: The Winter Soldier before ""Turn, Turn, Turn"", but am not upset by the fact that the show revealed the huge plot points rather than the movie. Yes, I will be seeing The Winter Soldier ASAP, but my heart has been so firmly gripped by the show that it felt more right to get the crazy news from there. I am sure the writers did a great job of making sure neither vehicle gave away too much.

This show has really come into its own since things began to come together after ""The Bridge."" I love these characters, including the ones I don't know whether to trust anymore, and have been blown away by the world being revealed.

If you hate it, re-watch it. If you still hate it, I'm sorry. But oh my goodness I am a complete SHIELD junkie!"
"Get better. If you watch 1, 2 or 3 is worst thing to see, no directions and bored. The first half of S01 is bad af. I'm glad to be patient and see how good this show becomes. I totally recommend!"
"I pity people who stopped on the first half of season 1, because apart from that, is one of the best shows I've ever watched. If IMDb ignored the reviews from season 1, it would be a solid 9"
"Agents of SHIELD is by far the best TV show based on Comic character (beside Netflix Marvel series like Jessica Jones Luck Cage , Daredevil and Iron Fist ) the characters are well develope . It's not like typical Superhero show with particular Villian and our hero defeat him and save the world , it's very complex and well written . the story is running parallel with the Marvel's movies (but without huge spoilers ) , and make you feel that marvel's world is so big and connected . Phil Coulson is the protagonist in the show but they don't focus on that , they give other character a very huge part in the story and you keep forgetting that there is a central character , and the character are so intersting , facinating and complex . It's worth watching and i hope they continue produce more seasons ."
"I remember how I felt after watching the first episode. It was 'meh' to describe it best. I think it was only out of sheer boredom I continued to watch it. I especially didn't like Skye. I found her too intrusive and irritating for my liking. But I knew the show still had some potential. The other characters entranced me. Sure the plot was bland and boring but I knew it was only the first few episodes out of twenty two. This meant there was room for development. And by gum did that last episode delivered.

The things with new series are is that they require patience. You have to be very picky if you expect an amazingly complicated plot right at the beginning. A slow start makes sense. It matters on where the show takes us afterwards. And we've been to a lot of places in AoS. It just took time to pull everything together for a neat finish. And I'm glad they took their time; how else are we able to achieve such a deep and rich relationship with all the characters?

I find it really funny how some of the viewers are still bitching about how there were no major SUPERheroes featured in the show. Well, the show made it clear that it was gonna be about the agents and the strength of humanity. Who cares the mains don't have any superpowers? It made me admire them only more.

This show lacked nothing at the end. But perhaps I shall give it a nine for the minor inconvenience of the first couple of episodes."
"You should give this series about a season before judging it, as a large part of the first season is setting the scene for what comes after. And in my opinion, everything that comes after, is definitely worth the wait.

As this television was born from the MCU you can expect superpowers, aliens, mysterious artefacts and overarching plots that make you want to rewatch it to enjoy its brilliance even more. This TV series might have grown out of the MCU, but quickly paved its own path, using Marvel as its inspiration, but not its limitation.

Watch the show, expect the unexpected and enjoy yourself."
"I have been anticipating this show for quite some time now, and my expectations were high. Let me start out by saying that I am a big Marvel and Avengers fan, so there was no question for me whether to watch this show or not. The fact that Clark Gregg (plays Phil Coulson) was in the cast only heightened my expectations and excitement! The pilot was, in my humble opinion, very decent. I wasn't blown away, but my expectations were met and I was intrigued by the story and entertained throughout the episode. I will definitely be tuning in for the next couple of episodes and ignore some of the bad reviews that I've been reading. The show is interesting and has potential to become a great show that will last for many seasons, which i hope it will.

My advice to you is, ignore the bad comments and reviews of the show and go take a look for yourself, you wont regret it!"
"Its such a cliché to say that every season gets better, I know. But M.A.O.S does just that. As Season 1 wound down, there was speculation that the storytelling wouldn't support the longevity. We wanted to see our favorite heroes from the Marvel Universe but even tie ins with other marvel characters such as Jamie Alexander as Sif from Thor and Sam Jackson as Nick Fury felt like hand me downs from an older sibling. Luckily we got a season 2 and so on. The show's strength seems to be that every new season seems to turn the story on its head and milk more action and drama. With season 4, the show has finally reached a point where it doesn't need any gimmicks. At this point, who cares about the other MCU characters! These characters own their own universe right now. At this point I'd rather see them make an appearance in one of the MCU movies! Season 4 did give us the best Ghost Rider we've ever seen... Now I want to see a Robbie Reyes movie. The season 4 storyline with the LMD's and especially ep 4.15 reminds me of when Star Trek Next Generation finally grew out of the shadow of the original and proved it could carry itself on its own merit. Well done guys.... BRAVO!"

"Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D had a rocky start considering it's inception was the brain child of Joss Whedon and with backing of Marvel off the back of the hugely successful Avengers movie. The show suffered from being in the shadow of the movie verse and over promised on something that it never had the ability to deliver which was a story inter-woven with the events of the movies. I could pick apart the show's first season for hours talking about the trouble of episodic T.V in a world that has moved on from that and the poor execution of and end of season twist with one of it's characters. Most viewers tuned out after that and it's a shame because the events The Winter Soldier was the best thing to happen to the show. It allowed the show runners to break away from the movie's and to do it's own thing and this is where the show became interesting. With a greater focus on it's own cast and telling their own stories this is a show that season by season has taken some exciting twists and turns and broken out of the mould it's own frame work. AOS has done unusual of starting bad and getting better each season, it has matured well and I would encourage anyone with an interest in good sci-fi or hero-esc stuff to give it another go."
"This show is not about The Avengers it's about S.H.E.I.L.D. S.H.E.I.L.D appear in most Marvel comics X-Men, Spiderman, Fantastic Four etc. This story is about their fight not the super heroes.

If your watching this show because of the Avengers, you will probably be disappointed.

The story is very straight forward, new technology is out there, the rich, powerful, individual's and organization's around the world are trying their best to get their hands on it. Of course there doing this illegally and of course the innocent will get caught in the cross fire. S.H.E.I.L.D's job is to protect the world form it's new reality, since the Avenger battle in New York. The general dialogue and interaction is not great, but the humor of Agent Coulson(Clark Gregg) is good and the dialogue improves in the more 'serious moments'. The character's and acting again have some positives and negatives, Agent Coulson is a treat to watch, the two main S.E.I.L.D agents are solid and I am optimistic about their development over the season. The rest are cliché in a bad way and very annoying, I'd have to get into spoiler's territory to explain in detail.

It'll be interesting to see the how the grand scheme of the season develops(there better be one), I assume there will be an organisation or individual who will be the main focus down the line.

Overall I think 7 is fair, I can't wait to see what the Agent's of S.H.E.I.L.D face next week."
"If you go into this show expecting anything like the movies, you are going to be gravely disappointed. Right now it's at about a 5 out of 10. I thought the pilot was at times kind of a snore fest. The writing at times was juvenile at best. I expected so much more from this show, with all the hype and all. I hope it improves in the coming weeks, or it might be taken off my dvr. The pacing of the show somehow needs to be changed. I like the lead actor a lot, and was glad to see him carry his role over to the show. Maybe the wow factor is yet to come. Things need to be explained a bit better as well. I'm sure they can get it right. with so much to watch on TV will there be enough time to do just that."
"I reviewed the show during the first season, when it was just off to a rocky start, and I said it had potential. But that potential has been satisfyingly reached, and continues to increase with every consecutive season. Without giving any spoilers I'd like to know that there are a lot of twists later on in the first and second season, that really make it a lot more worthwhile to hang in for, and when you go and re-watch the first season with those twists in mind, you realize that it wasn't just something they threw in to make it more interesting, it was something they planned from the beginning and dropped little hints towards that no one noticed. Ward was my least favorite character, until his true nature was revealed, and then when you go back and look at it with the experience of later events, you can see that there's much more underneath the surface. They were playing the long con, fooling people and thinking they were an average episodic show, when they had much more in mind for it. I have never been excited for any episode of agents of shield as I am the season three premiere, and I can't wait for the secret warriors story arc. The 10 I'm rating this is a bit preemptive, because I expect that season three maybe one of the best things to happen to the Marvel universe since Iron man 1, but it's also a bit of an apologetic rating for misjudging it early on in the first season. I now prefer agents of shield to arrow which used to be my favorite superhero show, but is now trailing in a close second.

The visual effects get a 10 out of 10, on par with supernatural or fringe The acting gets an 8 out of 10, added points for Agent may, Skyes impressive character development, and a lot of the humorous moments between Colson and Nick fury, or the infinite likable agent tripp, points docked for Fitz and Simmons ""trying to sound smart"" speak in season one, although a lot of their more annoying badly written character quirks are ironed out by season two The writing gets a nine out of 10, mostly because hard to write something I don't see coming a mile away, though it might be a bit generous considering a few of the missteps in the early episodes of season one

The fight choreography gets a nine out of 10 for how well it blends with the visual effects, though it might've been a 10 out of 10 if daredevil hadn't come out with that awesome fight scene in the hallway the same year

I now have nothing but high expectations and hopes for the show and I hope it only improves further. A few areas of improvement include Bobbi Morse who is not likable at all, and maybe some kind of seriously superpowered villain, or possibly the skrull invasion, or something on par with that? So far the major antagonists are a bit interchangeable, Whitehall being the major exception, who is probably the best written villain yet. But I feel this show does best with the villain that is both superpowered and covert, mixing subterfuge, espionage and superpowers in action. But the good news is they set up the foundations to make something like that happen spectacularly"
"I don't even know how to describe how much I love Spartacus, both the original and the prequel. I've watched the entire series all the way through at least four or five times because it's just that good. All you have to is read through the reviews to see how beloved this series is. The entire cast is just incredible. I think most people thought when Andy Whitfield tragically died and they had to recast the role of Spartacus that it would drop in quality. It didn't! As good as Whitfield was, Liam McIntyre stepped in and was just as good. It will grab your attention from the first episode and hold it throughout the series. If you haven't seen this amazing show yet stop what you're doing right now and go watch it!"
"It's so good I'm watching it all over again. 10 years later it's still holds up. Amid all the glorious violence I had forgotten just how surprisingly emotional this series was. If you have not seen it, watch it!

For fans of Gladiator, Xena, Hercules, and works by Sam Raimi. You need not have seen the original 1960 film Spartacus to enjoy the series as they are not related.

Warning - every episode contains nudity and explicit sex scenes. You have been warned.

And don't forget to watch the 6 episodes of Spartacus: Gods of the Arena, which aired between seasons one and two, but could be watched after this series. This was basically a holdover for the fans while it was hoped for and assumed by everyone involved that Andy Whitfield's return would be eminent.

Sadly, Andy Whitfield was taken from us a year and a half after the final episode aired. If you like Andy and enjoyed his performance make sure to check out the documentary Be Here Now. RIP Andy Whitfield."
"Spartacus is ridiculously underrated and absolutely one of my favorite tv shows ever! It is one of the rare shows where each season is just as incredible as the others, all 4 seasons are fantastic & some of the best tv I've ever seen! I've watched the entire series 3 times already. After the original actor (Andrew Whitfield) who played Spartacus sadly died of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma after Season 1, they had to recast it and the actor who replaced him (Liam McIntyre) as Spartacus was just as terrific! Do yourself a favor and watch this incredible series immediately...you will not be disappointed! It really is the perfect show!"
This series rocks! It is full of action packed historical fiction plots. As well as plenty of gratuitous nudity! Hehe
"I started watching this very belatedly in early 2019 while waiting for the final season of Game of Thrones. I figured some swords-and-sandals would fit the bill in the meantime.

For the first two episodes, that's exactly what I got. Nothing special; a lot of gory violence, graphic sex and nudity, and colourful baroque mock-Shakespearean dialogue so over-the-top that I couldn't tell whether the acting was good or not. However, I had seen John Hannah (Batiatus) and Lucy Lawless (Lucretia) in other things before, so I stuck with it.

And damn, did the show hook me quickly after that. Yes, the dialogue is absurd and nobody ever spoke like that, but the actors deliver it with such unrestrained gusto and are clearly having such a blast making the show that you can't help but get swept up in it. Also, the dialogue has the added virtue of being clever and well-written: for example, there's a scene in the final season (don't worry, no spoilers) in which Marcus Crassus is having a discussion with his son Tiberius and a young Julius Caesar. Crassus is speaking to both of them, and they are answering him -- but Crassus is completely oblivious to the fact that Tiberius and Caesar are simultaneously having their own verbal sparring match against each other, while still advancing their three-way discussion. I rewound that scene a few times just to watch it play out.

Gory violence and graphic sex can only sustain a show for so long; fortunately, the characters are beautifully written and developed, and their relationships with each other (romantic or otherwise) are allowed to evolve and progress. By the end of the show I had come to care greatly about the central characters -- and what else could possibly be the mark of well-written characters effectively portrayed?

It's the stuff of TV legend by this point that Andy Whitfield, who gave a virtuoso performance as Spartacus in season one, was diagnosed with cancer shortly after filming wrapped, and that it took his life. The switch to his successor Liam McIntyre took a little bit to get used to, but McIntyre stepped into the unenviable position of taking over from a well-liked and tragically departed predecessor in a central role, and made it his own. No small feat, that.

In closing, if you're not a fan of gory violence, graphic sex and nudity, and casual profanity, this show won't be for you. If you're a ""fan"" of those things, watch the show, and you'll be surprised by how quickly they take a back seat to the story and the characters. Enjoy!"
"The complete series is an absolute masterpiece. As a former Australia producer I am so proud of the most sincere work not only from the cast but also the crew. Based in New Zealand it brings a complete smorgasbord of the great talents from director, producers, cinematography to a unique editing style and I must impress upon the casting just perfect. To all involved you do yourselves proud and you bring credit to our industry. Job well done!"
"For me the pilot was something of a mix between the graphic violence of 300(it even includes somewhat similar battle sequences), the sex of 300, the idea of Gladiator and a bit of Rome. I almost stopped watching it and I'm glad I didn't do it. People would see the first episode and dismiss it as ""gore and sex"" time-wasting perversity. And they would be mistaken. The plot, filled with at first glance one-dimensional characters, is so varied, so deep, full of plot twists and unpredictable outcomes that you may find yourself glued to the screen.The sex is still there, the sexy images as well(muscular men and beautiful women), but the characters have gained so much depth and perspective, that you can't say someone is just white or black(with two exceptions). There are so many shades of gray in between, that most of the times even if you want to hate a character for plotting against the protagonist, you find yourself siding with him on another level. The protagonist is not a saint, the ""bad guys"" show they can love and cherish, and you see the other side of mighty Rome, the one not shown in ""Rome"". This show, even after the less than spectacular pilot, can be and for the moment is great and it's not the gore or sex that make it so.

In 300, Rome and even Gladiator, to which Spartacus: Blood and Sand is usually compared, the main characters are free men and women, people who act on their generally free will(yes, even in Gladiator). This show is different. Spartacus: Blood and Sand displays the Roman world through the eyes of the downtrodden, the helpless and the people without rights - the enslaved, THE underdogs, who eventually tried to defy the might of Rome, who lost and lost in an epic and tragic way and in their fall still achieved greatness and immortality. Among the nudity, spilling blood and duel sequences, Spartacus: Blood and Sand shows the viewer why freedom is such a cherished thing, what happens when we lose it and why people throughout time have risen to regain it and died pursuing it or defending it.

Some people mock the characters for being ""one-dimensional"" and demand more complexity. Others have voiced their contempt of the less than accurate representation of ""the complex social system of Rome"". Spartacus: Blood and Sand does not seek to represent the social system. For the people at the bottom of the ladder it was irrelevant whether Sulla was killing senators or Pompeus was gaining power. As for the one-dimensional characters, let me pound the obvious and say this - when you have to kill a friend at the command of your master, or be killed as well, there's no possibility for inner struggle or soul searching. You can't really disobey your master when humiliation, rape, torture and death lie just a whim away.

It's early to say definitely whether Spartacus: Blood and Sand will be a great TV show. It certainly is for now and gets better and better. Unless the creators manage to screw up gigantically, which they have avoided so far, this child of Starz can become epic."
"Yes, the show starts out dull and mindless. Yes, the show offers full frontal nudity. Yes, it's bloody violent (if you measure it in buckets of blood). No, it is NOT a storyless show.

To get it out of the way: If you can't stand a naked breast; skip this one. I know how some people are very sensitive to naked skin, but I guess a chopped off head is OK? (Yes, I'm kicking your way you ""Oh, that's Janet Jacksons covered up breast on live TV. I have to call the TV network""-people).

Each episode added a new layer as I see it. The characters grow in dept, and the conspiracies grow ever more entangling. I always wanted to see more after the second episode. The show exploded! For a show like this to even work the producers had to make a choice between kiddy-TV and adult TV. They chose the latter and hit the damn spot. Spartacus Blood and sand is one of the few shows that is just for us ""big kids"". I don't care if people are naked or headless on TV, as long as it suits the show. In this case it had not worked without it. Praise the gods that someone had the guts to think past the double morals of todays television and just press on! Rome was no flower-covered heaven on earth.

The acting can seem stale at first, but each actor grows in their role as the show progresses. A few of them impressed me, as I had deemed them to be c-graded actors a long time ago (Xena, anyone?). Some of the stars of this show seem to have found a show that suited them as much as they suited the roles they had to fill.

To avoid spoilers I will not say much about the story. What I can say is: The story evolves at the same rate as the actors/characters. Nearing the end you will beg for more! It's hard even to catch your breath after what I have just seen: The last episode offers the greatest form of chatarsis I have ever witnessed/felt in a TV show.

I will root for Spartacus in season 2 (and 3, and 4).

Sorry about the spelling errors and such."
"This is not a series for everyone and many people will find a lot in it offensive. They will have good cause. If you are under 16 you should not watch it. Why am i so excited by it then: For the ones that want to see fights, blood, brutality, sex, men looking like gods, blood, erotica, excitement, blood, swearing, allot of skulls being bashed, sweat, savagery, arena fights, honor, friendships intrigues, assassinations, and lets not forget some more blood, this is a show for you.

It is brutal and it is one of the best shows out there. It is not a soup opera and if you are one of those people that got excited by a show like CAPRICA skip this one.

This show makes your hart race. The first episode is the weakest, but by episode 4 which i just saw i am swearing by all the Roman Gods that this is what i was born to watch. It is raw bloody entertainment!

This show is so unique, it is in a category with THE WIRE, thought they have noting in common and their uniqueness lies in completely different places, they are bot light years away of what is being made.

For a low budget with computer graphics, after the first weaker episode, the show becomes so realistic, by episode 4 it has griped me in its razor sharp clutches and the downward spiral of darkness is leaving bloody marks on my soul!

If you like it you will love it, if you don't like it you will hate it."
"Blood and Sand was released in the golden age of TV shows, when they were starting to get good and not just some cheap filler for your Wednesday evening. Netflix had recently started its streaming service, but people are still watching TV every now and then and Spartacus would show up late at night.

Spartacus has everything that today's public truly desires: violence, sex and a good story, mirroring the wishes of the Romans in the gladiatorial age. And Spartacus excels at all of it. The show starts with the warning that the graphic violence is there due to the historical portrayal of ancient Roman society. Yes, that's totally the reason for your boobs and violence: historical accuracy.

If you'd just look at some of the screenshots from this show, you'd be forgiven for thinking that it is utter trash, as you behold a bunch of half-naked bodybuilders and fake blood effects. And while Spartacus is no Citizen Kane and you won't be using it as study material for your history major, it is a surprisingly high-quality show. It's just very stylized and this stylisation can come off as cheap.

Spartacus Blood and Sand as well as its prequel, Spartacus Gods of the Arena, concentrate on the time leading up to the Third Servile War, rather than the rebellion itself. This is an interesting place in time to focus on. The story is mostly that of revenge, but there are a number of other clear-to-understand themes present: corruption in pursuit of power, spectacle, betrayal, identity, social class and of course, bromance. Lots and lots of bromance.

The primary brain behind the show is Steven DeKnight, who's worked on shows like Smallville, which is exactly the kind of show I would name as an example of why I used to hate television shows. It was therefore surprising that the same person who wrote for Smallville also wrote for Spartacus. Apart from a few issues in the first few episodes, Spartacus is comprised of intricate plotlines and has a distinctive dialogue that is generally well thought out. Although the dialogue is theatrical in nature, it is still natural and clear enough to be understood, without being pretentious. The pacing is good throughout the show. The episodes do not drag on and so the material is not stretched beyond its worth, like in so many other shows of the time. The intensity is maintained throughout.

Andy Whitfield's portrayal of Spartacus has surprising depth and intensity for a previously unknown actor, God rest his soul. The classically trained John Hannah was an excellent choice for the ambitious dominus of the gladiatorial school. Jonah gives a deep performance, which in combination with the writing for this character, makes his character far more interesting than Spartacus, who only wants vengeance. Lucy Lawless, as the wife of the dominus, makes the complex relationship with her husband work. It is really cool that the show made the antagonists such believable people with complicated backgrounds and motivations. They did go a bit too far with Craig Parker's Roman legate, but he is not in the first season that much.

Of course, the acting and the dialogue are not without flaws. Sometimes, the character development is hard to buy and the naked warriors in the snow make you wonder if the show let go of its senses for the sake of style, but those flaws are quickly outshined.

With regard to the visuals, the obvious question comes to mind: is Spartacus ripping off the style of 300 (2006)? Yes. Yes, it does. The naked bodybuilders, the intense CGI skies, the excessive blood, the macho culture, and the slow-motion fights. It's all here. The fake blood and the CGI do make it look a bit cheap, but the fakeness becomes a part of the theatrical theme that runs throughout the show, along with the style of dialogue, and frankly, Spartacus overshadows the movie 300 and makes it look like a rip-off from Spartacus rather than the other way around. Even though Spartacus uses a lot of computer effects for its backgrounds, there are also quite a number of detailed sets, that sell this show on a physical level.

Once the rebellion starts, with the 2nd season (technically 3rd, if you could the prequel), called Vengeance, the show lost me. With a different lead actor, due to the death of Andy Whitfield, and following the departure of John Hannah, as the primary antagonist, the show had nothing but CGI and naked models left to prop it up. The rumour is that the other seasons are not bad, once you get used to the new cast. However, what I really like about both Blood and Sand and Gods of the Arena is that they have a satisfying end without any major cliffhangers designed to make you watch the next season. So, if you decide to step out at season 1, you can do so without any penalties.

I conclusion, Spartacus is less like a complex wine and more like big juicy steak - great for some, but can be a bit much for others. The grotesque violence and sexual filler make it seems like teenagers are the target audience, but the show proved popular not only with my testosterone filled male friends, but with the ladies as well."
"Spartacus changed my life in better. Even after the dead of the first actor who played Spartacus, i continued watching and i loved it. It's about force, power, humble, the sense of life, Love and much more. If you need strength or if you are depressed, you must watch Spartacus. Have patience and watch till end. You won't regret it!"
"I felt skeptical about the upcoming series when I first saw the trailers but thought; maybe it will be better ... the voice-overs did promise greater things. However, from the first episode I felt real disappointment. Rather than being more realistic it's more Hollywood. Yes, it does offer graphic violence - more on that later - and full frontal nudity but it falls short in a number of other areas. But first let me digress to some of the other points: By far the best performance I've enjoyed in this offering is that of John Hannah as Batiatus. His consummate skill as an actor leaves me feeling he deserves more success. His significant other is Lucy Lawless as Lucretia. She is well cast and certainly entertains and keeps up with Hannah. She's beautiful and shows it and comes through feeling like there's a nice bit of underlying intelligence I'd like to know better. One of the most fun characters is Viva Bianca as Ilithyia. She plays the part with a kind of delicious wickedness that's absent malice. She is also quite something special to look at, especially disrobed; which brings us to the male flesh offerings. Andy Whitfield as the title character Spartacus does a credible job but I can't overcome the idea he's in the part because someone in Hollywood thought he'd just look good. His antagonist in much of the episodes I saw is Manu Bennett as the gladiator Crixus and Peter Mensah as Doctore; a sort of gladiator teacher/overseer. Whitfield and Bennett snarl at each other appropriately and put up with full body depilation as their major sacrifice for their art.

The costumes, makeup, sets, and other production are rendered with quality if not historic accuracy. Without researching the issue, I find it hard to swallow the prevalence of depilation. It just doesn't ring true to what I recall from studying ancient history. The ancients were rather proud of their body hair as proof of their maturity and not even females shaved anywhere; none of that is evident here. But I suppose it's a minor point but I just felt that it flew in the face of the claims that they were striving for more historic accuracy. That gets us to the gritty parts, the violence, nudity and sex. The violence depicted here is over-the-top Hollywood all the way. The copious amounts of arterial blood that appear at the slightest wounds just smacks of sensationalist violence rather than accuracy. That - the violence - is a subject I know all too much about. Even severing an artery doesn't produce that much blood that fast. The sort of violence in the real world also produces a good deal more gore; not to mention that none of the film makers can ever hope to duplicate the accompanying odors. Worse, to me, by far is the fact that the bloodiest parts seem to be uniformly rendered in slow motion; thereby seeming to emphasize the bloodiest violence as the most important part of the offering. This aspect disappointed me the most.

The nudity and sex are more realistic than likely anything that has been presented by the modern media thus far, but it still falls far short of the reality of those times. Nudity then was a lot more prevalent, a lot more common and a lot more matter-of-fact.

I found it curious that the violence is far more emphasized that any other part of the equation; even the nudity and sex. I had the certain thought that if the sex were given an emphasis equal to that of the violence then we'd be treated to full screen sized vaginas opening in slow motion. It all left me feeling that the sad fact is that violence - even the most brutal types of depictions - are still far more socially acceptable than the relatively calm and peaceful pursuits involving nudity and sex. That still feels like an indictment against modern society. At least the ancients were more-or-less uniformly and honestly depraved. If I watch the remainder of the series it will more than likely be to enjoy the non-violent performances of Hannah, Lawless and Bianca. They are the best of it."
"After the first season you'll notice changing in the main actor ""Spartacus"". That's because Andy Whitefield passed away because of cancer. The series deserves a try but this is an appreciation post for Andy."
"I watched the whole Spartacus series back when it first came up and now I'm revisiting it. Still, it does stand it's ground. I had no recollection of Jai Courteney being in the series and I don't like him as an actor but as Varro he is just great. All the acting is great, even when it's over the top, it all just fits together so nicely. Yeah, the GCI is a bit funny now and then but after just a few episodes, I really started to enjoy it. This show is sad, exciting and just pure fun to watch. To Andy: you made such an impression on younger me and you still do. You are a legend."
"I can't stand much of whats on TV. What I love about this show is the amount of sensuality and poetry it brings to the table, while not being sensory with respect to sexuality, violence, and ethics. I usually hate romance, but the romance in this movie is genuine, there are several forms of love and lust that are identified in the episodes. The fact that they have homosexuality in it despite possible conflicting interest--what would seem to attract small target audience--does suggest a good portrayal of sexuality at that time (Although i doubt that only a couple of them would be subject to homosexual lust because many of the mentors and mentees mated at that time).

As a previous rater stated, the characters have shades of evil and good. Their ethics seems to match what values were imbedded in the roman civilization. The reason there is so much blood and it over indulges is because the show not only explicitly includes sensual dialogue, but the way it is directed and the tactics of capturing violence and glory are not 2D and speak to its sensuality. Bottom line: if you are a passionate person, you will enjoy the dramatic dialogue and poetry, the sexuality, and the brutality."
"I don't wanna write a long review, i just wanna put words and thoughts in one sentence : I CAN NEVER WATCH ANY SERIES AFTER WATCHING SPARTACUS"
"If you want a series about Roman history, one can watch HBO's Rome (a very fine TV show). If you want to see a trashy and outrageously entertaining TV show with nonstop gore and nudity (both male and female) as well as graphic sex, Spartacus (very loosely based on the history of Ancient Rome's slave gladiator turned rebel leader) should be the choice.

Supposedly, TV shows are by necessity tamer than movies, yet I haven't seen any movie as consistently graphic about sex and violence as Spartacus. Suffice to say that almost everybody in the large cast of mostly muscular men and gorgeous women, gets naked in the series at some point. Episode 9 in particular – subtly called ""Whore"" – is a highlight in that regard.

A bit slow to start (I struggled with episode 1, but get hooked after episode 2), this admittedly not for all tastes series, was filmed in New Zealand with a mostly Australian and Kiwi cast. Its striking visual style can be compared with 300 (the gladiator's trainer, the great Peter Mensah, had a small role in that movie). The show is finely led in the titular role by Andy Whitfield (unfortunately he died of cancer after the first season, and was replaced by another actor in the following season). Yet, even if most of the cast is great, the best performance to me is by John Hannah as the devious Batiatus, the owner of the Gladiator's school. Hannah, whose background has been mostly on British comedies, excels here. While he initially seems to lack the toughness one supposes a master of a gladiator's school should have, he is eventually seen as a charming yet also very cruel and cunning man. Also remarkable are the performances of Manu Bennett as the knucklehead (but eventually noble) gladiator Crixus, Viva Bianca as the gorgeous but scheming Ilythia, and Nick Tarabay as Batiatus slimy aide, Ashur."
"its been said many times on this site but i want to add by voice, Spartacus is the TV show now and one of the best ever, along with Sons of Anarchy.

sure it started life as a 300 clone but now the story line, acting, characters, plots twists, everything are beyond the best TV and movies ever made. sure, that's a bold claim, but how long does a movie last, even multi-part epics like Godfather and LOTR only last a total of about 7 hours. in only 1 season of Sparticus we've seen characters evolve and schemes develop.

the script writers must be some kind of gods to come up with this. like many, i love that the bad guys aren't all bad, the good guys not all good. all TV and movie writers should study this to see how real characters are developed and stories created.

and the acting, where to start, Andy Whitfield and John Hannah are brilliant and Peter Mensah just owns the screen every time he's on camera. That guy should be the next Denzel or Samuel L Jackson.

and as to those who say 'too much sex, too much violence' i say 'bring it on!'"
"I went into this with a skeptical attitude and wanted it to be great! I love Epics and being a fan of the Epics of the 1950's and 1960's, and the original SPARTACUS with Kirk Douglas in particular, I was very interested in what would be done with this version. I have no problem with differences in the interpretation of the story since the true history of the actual Spartacus is very sketchy. Historians know very little about many of the details in his life and the military campaigns, so I'm open to changes in one dramatic version over another.

The problem I have is mainly with the production values of this version. Let's start with the script. I realize that all films cannot take the course of Mel Gibson's THE PASSION OF THE Christ and present a subtitled film with the actors speaking the original language of the historical period. Kevin Costner brilliantly used this technique as well with the Native Americans in DANCES WITH WOLVES. However, a film maker doesn't have to take it to that extreme. In the historical epics of the past, scripts were often careful to not include dialog which sounded too contemporary in order to give it the illusion of a past time. This helps the audience's acceptance of the story having taken place in times past. Ben-Hur (1959) is a good example of this. Spartacus (1960) has some dialog problems but is also, for the most part, a good example of this.

That said, this version of SPARTACUS seems to go out of it's way to sound every bit like Martin Scorcese's GOODFELLAS, complete with use of the F-bomb every couple minutes along with every other contemporary expletive one might imagine, including the ""C"" word, the ""B"" word, the ""S"" word, etc. Simply put...It sounds absurd. Can we at least try to give this some semblance of ancient history. With the expletives and the grunting and groaning of the muscle bound performers during the battle scenes, it sounds and looks like the warriors originated with the WWE.

Next up is the violence. I stop short of referring to the violence as exploitive, which it is, but it is SO extreme that it is silly. The use of slow motion, normal motion, slow motion, normal motion mixed with squirting blood all over the camera, all over the other actors, squirting out fast, squirting out slow from this angle and that angle is once again, absurd. It is SO overdone that one is desensitized after watching 45 minutes of the first episode. At one point a character gets punched in the face and even THAT is in slow motion. It's laughable! This viewer got the impression that this was being filmed by students in a high school film class who couldn't get enough slow motion and gory blood spilling. Most of the blood spilling is CGI anyway and looks fake.

That brings up my next criticism. I highly doubt that there is one scene in this travesty that was filmed on location. EVERYTHING, including the most simple scene appears to use the CGI technique and it makes the entire production look like one massive computer game.

Next we have the overuse of sex scenes which are equally as silly as the violence as they are all choreographed to look like the covers of cheap romance novels with men who look like they're from Chippendales and women who look like they stepped out of the Victoria's Secret catalog. No one looks natural. It's buffed bodies and big boobs. Because of the sexually explicit nature of some of the scenes, I can't go into detail here. I guess the tamest way to put it is that some decadent scenes appear as if they were filmed in an S&M club.

This is truly an exploitive piece of garbage that falls just short of being pornography....bad acting and all, but I'm sure it will find an audience. After all, Shakespeare said it best, this kind of exploitation is there to ""Split the ears of the groundlings who, for the most part, are capable of nothing but inexplicable dumb shows and noise."""
"Starting off I was immediately hooked onto the show. Mainly because of Sam and Dean being so much fun to watch. Jensen and Jared's chemistry on the show is so good. Other supporting characters too like Bobby, Castiel, and others also help the show. The show itself may be a little corny at times, but that's the fun of it. Yes the show may have gotten mediocre to down right ridiculous after season 5, however the first 5 seasons are entertaining, funny, emotional, and captivating. As weak as the later seasons may be, Jensen, Jared, and Misha are the reason why people still love the show. Even when the writing was at it's weakest the cast always delivered."
"Plot

Two brothers follow their father's footsteps as hunters, fighting evil supernatural beings of many kinds, including monsters, demons, and gods that roam the earth.

Cast

Where would you even start? Anyone and everyone, incredible leads, solid regulars and some great one off cameos. No Paris Hilton, I'm not including you.

Verdict

15 seasons, 15 years, 327 episodes, like it or hate it Supernatural was a remarkable success story made good mostly in my opinion by the fantastic cast who kept the show enjoyable because you came to care about them so much. This made even more intense by the fact any character was expendable, even if statistically the chances of them returning was still very high.

The show changed greatly over the years, for me the first 4 seasons were the best. They had wafer thin storylines and more focused on ""Monster of the week"" writing and I loved that. From season 5 onwards it become heavy focus on angels, demons, heaven, hell and that took it in a direction I wasn't overly keen on. But again, the cast were so great I soldiered on through and though surprisingly that focus never shifted it was still very enjoyable and regularly threw us old school standalone episodes and plenty of gimmicky ones (Most of which worked).

The perfect blend of comedy (With two guys with great natural timing especially Ackles), horror and drama though Supernaturals quality dips it never falls into the realms of being bad. Lowest episode I still rated a 6/10.

Which brings me to an apparently controversial one, most people despise the final episode in fact many dislike the last two. Me? I understand the hatred of the final one, but had no issue with it myself. Was it cheesy? Absolutely. Did it feel a tad tacked on? Yep. But it worked, it returned to the simple notion throughout the show that what they do is dangerous and any hunt they go on could be their last, it doesn't need to be a big-bad that brings about their end the death everyone seems upset by made sense to me as did the beautiful finale montage sequence. Did it do enough nods to previous characters? Absolutely not, however that was their episode, it was the end of their journey nobody elses.

And don't even get me started on the soundtrack, I'm of that right age, I'm a classic rock/metal fan and every episode was elevated by that. They always seem to pick the right song for the right moment, God Was Never on Your Side by Motorhead as the finale of Season 14 for example was fantastic. And Carry on my Wayward Son? What needs to be said about that masterpiece?

I love Supernatural, I'm a big Supernatural fan and always will be. I'm so happy I got to do that journey from the start and commend everyone involved.

Thank you Eric Kripke.

Rants

Who was your favorite character (Excluding Sam & Dean)? It's a tricky one isn't it, because there were so very very many. I adored Charlie, Bobby was a consistent joy but for me it was always Crowley. His unfortunate exit damaged the show for me, but the sheer quality overcame that. He was just, flawless. A couple of rants/monologues he did are among my all time favorite television show scenes. Can Mark Shepherd do wrong? If he can I've not seen it.

Breakdown

Leads are amazing Remarkably on point comedy Some great stories Incredible array of characters Best soundtrack ever Shows length is such an accomplishment Some ropey fight scenes A lot of repetitious melodrama A few poor writing decisions."
"Sam & Dean Winchester, the BEST brother duo. I love their relationship and the chemistry that these actors have on screen together really seals the deal on making the audience believe that the bond is real. I especially enjoyed the visuals they were good for the time that this series was airing. The whole spin on demons, angels, heaven, purgatory, and Lucifer was creative. I appreciate that it wasn't the typical angels are good and demons are bad narratives that are usually being taken. However I can admit that towards like season 13-14 things do get alittle redundant and repetitive, almost like they ran out of ideas."
"Supernatural is so much better than I expected it to be. I just binged the entire series on Netflix and it has quickly become one of my favorite shows ever. Jensen Ackles (Dean) and Jared Padalecki (Sam) were perfect for their roles and lead what is an overall great cast. I know most people hated the ending and while I didn't like it either, it doesn't take away for how good the show is overall. Most great shows struggle with a good ending, I just don't think that should take away from years of enjoyment you got from the show. I know this show was on forever and has 327 episodes but I still miss it. I definitely plan on watching it all the way through again sometime in the near future because it's just that good."
"I never watched Supernatural when it was actually on but a few months ago I thought I'd give a try. Well, I just now finished it and absolutely loved it. I'd even go as far as to say it's one of my favorite supernatural shows of all-time! Jensen Ackles and Jared Padalecki both did an amazing job as Dean and Sam. Their chemistry together is what makes this show so special. Like any great show some seasons were better than others but even the lesser ones are still worth watching. The only real negative about this show is the ending. It was awful, like really awful. As bad as the ending was I still give this 10 because I enjoyed almost everything else. I would love to see them come back for another season or even a movie to fix that ending but it is what it is. Anyway, I'm glad I gave this show a chance because I can add it as one of my favorite shows ever."
"You can really sum it up to one sentence. Supernatural family for life.

I have watched this TV show since season two, re-watched it countless times, that's hundreds of hours of my life just for one show, and better believe that I don't regret a second of it. There's no greater joy than watching this show, I have the Winchester tattoo, and one day I will watch this show with my kids. Yeah. It's that good. It has absolutely everything that you want out of the TV show. If you're reading this give it a shot, at least watch the first two seasons and trust me you'll be hooked. I know that most shows get stail and kind of boring after countless seasons, but Supernatural never did. See for yourself."
"I love the story behind it and I think the show is funny. I love dean's sarcasm. Dean is my favorite character. I love this show so much. It has a spiritual meaning behind it and despite the gore and violence, the show brings me comfort and safety. I see why it's so popular. It's a very good show and it talks about how family is so important and saving people is a good thing. Dean is a very lovable character. I wish Sam had more personality. Dean has a great personality. What's not to like? I could go on and on about this show all day. People say it's bad after season 6 but not really. I see the humor in it and this show has a lot of character,"
"After being disappointed by mediocre to bad new shows like Threshold and Invasion, I am glad that there's at least one new show that really delivers. Supernatural is in a whole different league, with proper style, suspense and great production values. This is a dark, moody show that understands how to use the television medium. The story isn't exactly complex, but the storytelling technique pulls you in and holds your attention, making you want to know more about the supernatural beings and the rules that govern their shadow world. I'm usually not a fan of darkness and horror, but this show is effective. It's dark urban fantasy and it has the potential to go a long way. As it is, the show is way, waay above average, and I rate the pilot episode an 8 out of 10."
"It is not the same show it used to be, now it's so lame an full of nonsense. Sam and Dean keeping getting those really really lowend jobs, come on! they have been to hell and back, all the weak creatures should run away from them and not towrds them.

Most of the episodes of every season are not about the main plot... Guess what? Those episodes suck!"
"I really enjoyed the show at first and would always look forward to the next episode. Having said that, the unhealthy codepency between Sam and Dean, especially Dean who is willing to sacrifice anything and everyone so that he and Sam could continue their little adventure together, started getting old. I still watch occasionally and have enjoyed some of the characters that have come and gone, God/Chuck comes to mind as a good one and Crowley was awesome. Still, when I do watch, I find myself kinda hoping Sam and Dean get obliterated."
"The best thing I've even watched in my entire life. It has a little bit of everything.

This TV show has played with vary different times lines, characters, genres, sub genres, character development, christianism and different types of gods and religions, problematic topics, importance of family, etc... Simply a work of art, Supernatural is a work of art in all the sense of the word.

Every season is a whole new different concept and storyline that somehow connects everything all too well. Every single little thing is tied together and meticulously used in order for that to happen. Just amazing."
"My favorite show ever!! If you are wanting to watch it PLEASE do. I know 15 seasons can be intimating but its soooooooo worth it. My aunt got me to watch it one day and im so glad that i listened to her because it literally changed my life, i know that sounds dramatic but its really true. Now that i've finished the show (and am rewatching it) i think that the first couple of seasons aren't the best but once you get to season 3 its definitely better. My favorite season is 10 because thats when rowena is brought in and she's amazing!! Now the ending wasn't my favorite but i don't think it was anyone's favorite."
"But! I love this, u got to love this. The tales, the ghosts, the demons, the Angels and so on. There is something for everyone. Its silly, its cool, its fun and you name and this series got it. There is just one thing I hate with this serie, it ends. First time I watched it, it realy didnt catch me but yes I had to go for a few more episodes and after 4 I was stuck. I have been counting down with a tear in my eye knowing that all good things come to an end but I will have the memories and the ability to watch it again from start and thats on my ""to do"" list withing a near future. So dont just sot there, go watch it."
"Supernatural is a one of a kind show. Previewing old tales and logic of beast that hunt human kind to this day. It makes you feel apart of a fight that could possibly be raging on today. With such likable characters that keep you engaged to the very end. I must say I don't agree with the general understand that only season 1-5 is the best works if the show. I rewatch this show every year starting around Halloween and sometime in the spring I find myself crying during the last episode understating the full cycle of a hunter is complete with a match made only in heaven.

Dean is by far my favorite character, followed by cass and Sam. I love the dad even with all his flaws but understand how the mom becomes the returning figure in the series because of her toxic yet parallel relationship with dean. Funny how Sam is his dad and dean is his mom."
"This series gave me strength and great comfort in challenging times in my personal life.

No matter what happens , this show gives me great comfort and happiness.

The acting is superb, some seasons are not that as exciting but I have always wished they would never end.

I strongly believed that Sam and Dean are my friends and they gave me great comfort to watch.

I would always be a loyal fan to the series and I hope when the right times comes the show will be renewed .

In today's world we live a channeling times so it's reassuring that we can go to this beautiful bubble where we can forget about our daily struggles.

Thank you for the creators and actors to make this happen .

I will always be a fan."
"15 years , 327 so only jumping if you have a lot of spare time on your hands.

It has its ups and downs, ignore all the controversy around the external things, just make your own judgement, it sets a high bar which some episodes didn't reach, it made mistakes, it's perceived as a show that would appeal to women because the leads are good looking. They are, but it's not, it's unique in being one of the increasingly few shows that portray relationships between sibling brothers who are straight white men who can and do show they love for each other in the most extreme ways, it brings in an extended cast to help carry the load as time goes on who are likable, some storylines crash and burn , other soar, but there something for everyone to enjoy.

It's well made, fans of cinematography will be able to luxuriate in the amazing lighting, direction, the sets are second to non and Canada officers her own take on America's back roads that whilst not authentic, give an atmospheric feel. Just sit back and enjoy the ride."
"Just watch the first 5 seasons that actually has a beginning, middle and end. Those are the seasons that really worth watching. And then pretend like the rest doesn't exist because each season after season 5 is worse than the previous one (especially season 12) And that finale... Oh GOD!!! It's just doesn't worth it."
"I personally have been waiting to see a show based on spooky plots and this show delivers. Supernatural is somewhat endearing in that the main characters (the only ones who will be recurring) are brothers, however, the writing makes the characters more believable. They are different from each other, each with their own take on life and things that are not typical. I think as the show goes on it will continue to get better,though it is great now. I can't wait to see more of this show!

Another plus is the little bits of humor placed here and there, which, when done right, is always a plus. Some of the best shows/movies are ones in which one minute you are sitting on the edge of your seat biting your nails and the next you are laughing at some irony or funny statement/joke a character has said. Also, having two very attractive men in the cast doesn't hurt, either ;)"
"For real. It was a 5 season story and the creator/show runner left after that season ended. Look at the end of the last episode of season 5; it was done, finished, all story lines wrapped up in a bow and they pulled out from the lovely moment at the end to show the flickering light of the street lamp. It was perfect, symbolising that the Winchester story was done, but evil would carry on in the world without them.

But then surprise!! They keep panning down and decide to undo what they've spent 5 years working towards in the dumbest way possible.

It's because the show was so liked by fans and the money as too good, so they (network, executives, whoever made the final decision) decided to carry it on for fans as opposed to staying true to Kripkes vision. And due to the lack of overall plot and cohesive story, as nothing was planned, it sucks. It's a slow decline from there, but it's consistent. They even wrote an episode at one point where Sam and Dean get transported to an alternate reality where they are actors in a tv show called Supernatural... Cause that's good writing.

So do yourself a favour, and only watch the first 5 seasons, it's all it ever should have been, and fans were placated to hell and back in the ten seasons that followed, and from all the reviews I've read, sorely let down by the ending. And fans are by and large the absolute worst writers there are, so just keep that in mind.

First 5 seasons I'd give 9 stars, because there are elements that could have been a bit better, though my criticism is slim. Every season after I would give a 1, hence the 5 star rating across the board."
"During the 90's I was a big fan of the X-Files to this day I still am. The X-Files had great stories and character development, which is needed for a great show. Supernatural has that from the very first episode. I admit that I missed the first 10 minutes of the show, but I knew exactly what happened and where the story was going. Most shows you tune into after the first few minutes your lost and you lose interest, unlike Supernatural. CBS's Threshold, may not live up to the X-Files, but Supernatural does.

One final note, as long as the WB doesn't do any tweaking of the show this series will last for quite a few seasons."
"I was here from the start, at first it was entertaining, then the characters grow on you and it becomes something else.

The show is with you when you leave your parent's home, then the show is with you through your studies and after that. You know these boys. Ok they are invented characters, but so well written and coherent you find yourself one day horrified you know them better than your own siblings.

At some point i realized i was incapable of giving an objective critic about this show. I just liked it, whatever they threw at us.

For the record, after the episode ""changing channel"" i had bursts of uncontrollable laughter everywhere for 2 weeks. That was pretty incapacitating. Even thinking about it 10 years later, can't stop giggling.

Some episodes drew the tears as well, and not just a little. I'm looking at you, Bobby.

Best shark dodging ever too. I hope there is a prize with a statuette for this somewhere."
Hands down the best show I've ever watched. The gang are simply amazing. You can't help but love each single character. The plot has been flawless even though I'd have loved a better ending but I believe it's the most sensible one since they had to shoot it after season 2 so that the kids don't look older 7 years later. The writers have done such a great job and The fact that they've covered every single detail in the show makes it terrific.
"One of the more original and funny sitcoms I've been watching. After all, if it was bad it would not last for almost a decade. I've heard they spoiled it near the end, but after five seasons I have absolutely no objections.

8/10"
"How I Met Your Mother will go down as one of the better comedies of all-time (and rightfully so) but there's no doubt as to who's the best part of the show and that's Neil Patrick Harris (Barney)! He steals every scene that he's in and is funny in just about every episode. The entire main cast (Harris, Josh Radnor, Jason Segal, Cobie Smuthers and Alyson Hannigan) is great which makes this show so funny. The first season isn't as good so you may have to power through it out it's well worth it. Also, as most have already said...it has one of the worst finales to a show in the history of television! If for some reason you're one of the few people who haven't seen this yet then I highly recommend you do. It's almost impossible not to smile and have a good time during this show."
I have to admit that I created imdb account just to rate this show after watching it.
"How I Met Your Mother is one of those comedies that you can watch anytime it's on tv or even binge watch it and it will always be funny. The standout of this show is the hilarious Neil Patrick Harris as Barney. Not saying the rest of the cast isn't funny, because they all are, it a weak link on the show but Patrick Harris will go down as one of the all-time great sitcom characters. This has everything you want in a good sitcom, every episode will make you laugh out loud. Just be warned though, the ending is awful. Google worst tv show endings ever and i guarantee you How I Met Your Mother is on it. But being a sitcom it doesn't really take away from the show overall. It's still worth watching if you want a laugh."
Great show to binge watch. As it is mainly all flash backs it doesn't even have to be in order
"I love this show!! It's one of the best sitcoms on the air and one of the best CBS shows!!! I disagree with the other comment - Barney is the best character. He's the funniest person on the show. I love how the entire ensemble has chemistry together!! It actually feels like they're friends in real life. And I don't think they need new writers, they just need to grow a little more. This show gets better with time. I laugh so hard with the show that my sides hurt every time I watch. I recommend this show to anyone that has a great sense of humor and wants to laugh until their sides hurt. I hope that this show has a long run on the air."
"Great up until S5, good in S6-7, awful and unrewatchable from the very start of S8... What a shame"
"Last season made me nervous, depressed and confused! First seasons were good, but last season catastrophic!"
"I've enjoyed the first few episodes of this post ""Friends"" comedy. It really captures some of the humorous albeit awkward situations that late twenty-somethings are finding themselves in these days.

Alyson Hannigan once again presents her hilarious, quirky sense of style and humor. Along with her boyfriend, Marshall, they are an excellent representation of the couple who are trying to figure out an identity in the ""not still partying like college kids, but trying not to be all grown up"" stage of life.

The lead character, Ted, provides great entertainment. Audiences will be drawn in by his sensitivity and likability. He's not desperate to get married, but merely ready to find the One, tired of game playing.

Overall, I think this is a half-hour well spent. The humor is edgy, unpredictable, and you will find yourself reminiscing about those first few years after you graduated from college and struggled to find yourself out in the ""Real World."""
"How I Met Your Mother is a brilliant television series with a very well developed and detailed storyline that spreads out in to nine seasons and an outstanding comedic cast.The character development is outstanding,we learn so much about Ted (Josh Radnor),Robin (Cobie Smulders),Barney (Neil Patrick Harris),Lily (Allyson Hannigan) and Marshall (Jason Segel) throughout the course of nine years,you learn to love these characters very early on in the series and hope for the best for all of them as we watch their future progress,the show came out a year after the final season of Friends,and it was certainly a great replacement.The series last season is certainly the worst of the nine,I'm not going to lie,it made some risky choices that might not have worked out as well as the writers thought,I'm not sure how I feel about the last episode,it contradicted a lot of character development and had an unanswered question,after nine seasons,you would expect everything to be wrapped up.It will hit your funny bone as well as your heart,How I Met Your Mother is a fantastic series that I would highly recommend to anyone looking for a great comedy series.

Follows the story of Ted Moseby,as he tells his two kids the story of his life leading up to the day he met their mother.

Best Performance: Neil Patrick Harris Worst Performance: Britney Spears

Best Episode: The Final Page: Part 2 Worst Episode: Slapsgiving 3: Slappointment in Slapmarra"
"This review will fall into two pieces, inspired by the latest 2 episodes ( seriously guys, what the f... is going on with the musical bits and ridiculous rhyming).

Until season 5, somewhere mid-season 6: some of the best comedy I have ever seen. Hilarious, right on the spot, with great one-liners and characters. Absolutely wonderful.

Anything after that: what the f... went wrong? Lame jokes, terrible musical bits, awful dialogue, just plain awful TV. And yet somehow, I am still watching, just to see the last episode. Com' on guys, this should have finished 3-4 seasons ago: on your epic legendary peakness.

Thanks for all the wonderful laughs, but wow, you really overstayed your stay!!"
"I previously reviewed this show in the middle of the 7th season giving it an 8/10 because despite it dragging and having far too many filler episodes, it was gaining forward momentum to a finale. But after hearing news of yet another season renewal, I had to come back to change my review.

This show has hit its peak, steadily declined, and then suddenly lost all control and crashed into the wall of mediocre TV sitcom. When the creators lose interest in the main character, you know it leads to no good. Yes, Barney and his awesome catchphrases and clever ideas are a riot, but this is not his show, yet he has become the main character. Going back to season 6, this show has had him go through all these dramatic twists, turns, and changes in his adult life to lead him to being a better man. Good for him, but once again, this is not his show.

Ted has become an average joe with only a few solid episodes per season. Other than that, he is the butt of every joke, far from the witty, intelligent architect that was introduced back at the start. Even older Ted is starting to lose steam. Having to hear ""we'll get to that later"" for what seems every episode now really makes me shake my head. It's a formula that has worn out its welcome.

I loved this show and thought it was one of the most creative sitcoms brought to television in recent years, but I feel as though the people behind-the-scenes have abandoned what made this show so amazing in the first place, and have focused on that paycheck that comes with good ratings. The only reason this show has a 6 is because the first few seasons were so amazing.

Season 1 & 2: 10/10 hands down with Seasons 3 & 4 being great viewings as well. But how can this show appeal to a new audience knowing it would take 9 seasons just to get to the what the title represents. The journey should have ended a few seasons ago.

The creators and CBS represent Older Ted, while we, the audience, represent his kids--Dad, if we wanted to hear about Uncle Barney's entire life from childhood to adulthood, we'd ask him. Get to the point of your story, you're wasting our time."
"The Strain is about a viral outbreak in New York City that turns you into a vampire. It follows a team, led by the head of CDC and other residents of the city, as they look for a cure to this virus all the while as they wage war against the evil that plagues their city. It's a show that never slows down and at times doesn't make a whole lot of sense but you'll still have a good time watching it. The best thing about this show is Corey Stoll, who finally gets a job as a lead on a show and he doesn't disappoint. This show may not be for everyone but for anyone who enjoys a good vampire or supernatural show then you'll probably enjoy this too."
Everyone is so right about the kid. The kid from the first season is okay but the new kid actor they got after him ruined the show!! He's a terrible actor i'm sorry :(
I finally finished watching The Strain recently and have to say I really enjoyed it more than I thought I would. I'm a fan of vampire genre and deadly outbreak type shows so I'm not really sure why I out it off for so long. This is a lot different than any other vampire/deadly virus show that I've ever seen. I was definitely entertained from start to finish. All the characters and their background stories were all very interesting. Like most shows there are a few annoying characters but for the most part they're all pretty good. They also reward you with a great ending for sticking with it through the four seasons. It's hard to stick a good ending that is satisfying but this show pulls it off.
"I loved the series. Would have been much better if they killed off Zack in season 1. That kid was a worthless character. But other than that aggravating annoyance, the series was great. I was hooked from the beginning."
"A superb drama, fantasy, horror series by Guillermo del Toro and Chuck Hogan. I loved its uncompromising vibe and atmosphere, its ""gruesome"" screenplay, its near outstanding development and to some great extents its acting, besides Corey Stoll and Max charles who nearly undermined the series flow, especially in the last season.

One of the few series that truly combines horrific screenplay, storyline plots and gripping visual effects since the first episode.

Highly recommended and one of Guillermo del Toro's brightest and finest works."
"Yes, it has its flaws. It's full of plot holes and annoying over-used tropes. Yes, the kid character is incredibly annoying but I guess he drives the plot forward. Yes, the actor playing the kid is terrible and only has two emotions: Squinting with his mouth closed and squinting with his mouth open. Yes, in classic horror movie fashion everybody takes horrible decisions, they don't make sure their mortal enemy is actually dead, they go on silly speeches before going for the kill, allowing the antagonist to escape.

But overall, it was pretty enjoyable and different.

Great acting, apart from the kid.

7/10."
But this kid has got them beat hands down! I like the show overall and he's the only part of the show I could do without.
"I recently decided to watch ""The Strain"" as my Halloween series over October and can say I was pleasantly surprised by how well the story unfolded. The main characters, aside from the kid, were all fantastic. This show has a good balance of story telling, along with action and drama to keep you entertained. Furthermore, they did not stretch it out too long. 4 seasons was the perfect amount and the ending was good / provides closure to the series.

Reading other reviews I did see a lot of negative comments regarding the kid. And while I agree he was not a great actor nor did his decision end of season 3 make much sense, I feel that season 4 built on his character a lot and made the ending more satisfying."
"I like Del Torro's work so I was anticipating this show for some time. It started off strong, good concept, different take on things & I enjoyed maybe the first half of the season. The effects were good for TV. Then it became cheesy & super predictable. The acting from some of the cast was barely mediocre. The boy/son was hard to watch, he came off bratty & not a great actor (sorry, I know he's a kid) The ending, I won't spoil but was disappointing for a season finale. I highly doubt I will tune in for season 2 when there are so many other, better put together shows available like The Knick or Penny Dreadful. The best story line was about the old man when he was younger but that was it. Sorry, not a fan."
"Do not listen to the bad reviews, this TV show makes you want to watch more. Great acting and great writing. Each series gets darker and you see more character development as the world descends into chaos. Guillermo Del Toro has made a fantastic TV series worth watching."
"I'll start off by saying that this series compelled me to create an IMDb account.

There are many things that makes this show one of my all time favorites: 1) The intense, noir setting 2) No unwanted random scenes (Everything contributes to the plot) 3) Fast paced (the beginning is a little slow but it's very gripping) 4) Del Torro and his direction 5) Great animation and CGI 6) Very believable and rational story line 7) Dark atmosphere and background 8) Apocalypse and survival strategies

I'm a person that enjoys dark, intense setting with good story line and action I love shows like Death Note (anime), Lost, Game of thrones, the 100, etc

If you like any of the above mentioned shows or a thrilling, dark themed apocalyptic series, you're going to absolutely love this!

People who are asking so many questions right at the beginning of the show and are calling this stupid, are dumb AF. Literally everything is explained as the show goes on!

The first episode is captivating to say the least. It's a little slow after that, but it picks up pace real quick and from that point on wards it's one crazy ride with some kick-ass characters and a dark, apocalyptic atmosphere."
From the 2nd season on the kid actor is very bad. He cannot act. What is even worse is the character of the kid. The kid needs to be punched in the face. Over and over until he is knocked out. Over all the show good. Could have been been done in 2.5 seasons. Del Toro leaving was the worst thing that could have happened for this show. There is a major fall off once he left the show. The first season is by far the best. The last season is not worth watching unless you just have to watch them all. Stroll is a strong lead and shows he can carry a show. Durand also does a great job. In my opinion it my be his best role.
"Season 1: I was so excited I could not stop watching it. I love Vampire stories but not like Twilight, you are not supposed to fall in love with vampires. That is why I could not get into Twilight... but this story has got me completely hooked and I cannot wait to see what is in store for us in the coming seasons.

Season 2: So far I am absolutely loving this series, here is my character assessment.

Zach - He is a complete JERK and I am not sure what I would do if I was Eph, probably let him go.

Fet - What can I say about Fet except he is the epitome of machismo and I absolutely LOVE his sense of humor and MAN is he sexy!!!!

Setrakian - This character from the beginning caught my attention and I want to know how his character turns out."
"An interesting show with potential, but it's still too early for the jury to render a verdict. The cliché characters could be it's undoing. The writers need to stop insulting the intelligence of their audience and do their homework. As indicated by other reviewers, the CDC would never handle a biological threat in such an off-handed casual manner. And would anybody really believe they would allow a single corner to undertake the autopsies of an entire plane of dead passengers? We get it's science fiction but please don't insult the intelligence of the audience with such blatant plot flaws. This show has the potential to be another Walking Dead, but if the sloppy writing continues it will just be plain dead. My finger are crossed with hopes of some better writing to follow."
"Been meaning to get more into it I watched around 6 years ago before I was doing reviews even then I loved The Strain. Very interesting especially the Sci-Fi/horror aspects, some of it is a little stale but for the most part worth watching! Nice to see Corey Stoll with hair most projects he doesn't have any he looks better with hair. For someone has a lot of sleep struggles I'm gonna thoroughly enjoy a series like this that has a lot with investigating weird phenomena's and various other occurrences. There's not enough horror series or at least not enough that aren't about zombies or poorly made teenager shows, I'm surprised there's not more like Fringe or creatures I'd love that."
"I've been really looking forward to this series having read the books and thinking they were perfect for TV. The casting has been spot on, although John Hurt leaving was a bit of a disappointment, everyone has been good. COry Stoll's hair however seems a bit off putting. It is a series I'd recommend binge watching however as I think the sense of urgency from the books has somewhat lost for the weekly episodal first series. The great thing about the approach to the old and tested vampire mythology here is that it's fresh mix of science and religion. This will be expanded upon in the coming series which is good to hear. Only other complaint is the Master. Abandoning CGI effects for more traditional left him looking a bit more comical than intimidating for me unfortunately. That left aside however it's movie quality stuff in a TV series and worth a watch for any horror fan - updated now for the 3rd series, unlike the books which gallop along at an excellent pace this is being drawn out with unnecessary fluff. Unfortunate that."
"This show is one of the best most underrated post apocalyptic shows of all time and adds plenty of depth and complexity to the vampire mythology and genre as well as is ahead of it's time showing how the virus and mutations can spread and how corrupt the government can be in handling it.

Characters are interesting, varied and three dimensional, the action scenes are superb and show existential horror and survival perfectly and the writing for the most part is great people I loved all the seasons and while they originality wanted to do 5 seasons but got 4 they ended the show in satisfying way and concluded the story perfectly.

Overall watch this it's an amazing show and incredible example of how to do vampire mythology or post apocalyptic shows superbly well."
"Pretty okay for the most part, wish they'd have kept the first Zach. The first kid was fine, the second one is so unlikeable. A whiny brat, that one. Charlotte is a huge downgrade from Dutch, her mouth is so wide she'd make a great Strigoi.

I do love Fet & Quinlan!"
"Review for Season 2: The Strain very quickly turned to absolute garbage after the end of Season 1. It's mainly the writers' and the directors' fault. Most of the actors did the best they could with what they were given. And the special effects were still okay though not as good as Season 1. It's truly the story that took a turn for the worst. And it was impossible to care about anyone when their choices become so unbelievable. But the most grating part was the new actor for the boy, Zach, who the writers and directors chose to let play the most annoying character imaginable. I almost didn't finish this season. And I certainly won't be wasting my time on Season 3 or 4. Such a shame when Season 1 was such a promising beginning."
"I did not watch much of the show when it was originally on TV. Now, about 25 years after it started I decided to watch something that ""is 90's"" and BH 90210 was the show that right away got into my head.

So I went through all the 10 seasons, now in my 30's and I must say I really enjoyed it. The fact that the actors were older than the characters doesn't bother one at this point anymore, actually it helped. It almost brought the feeling back of me watching the show about the older kids who are already in high school, just like it was back when I was 10 and caught a few episodes.

It is of course very cheesy, yet entertaining. One can see how Aaron Spelling started and set up the formula for the teen dramas that followed Beverly Hills. It is also great to see the 90's go by in their clothes and the things they live through.

I loved their high school years, but I enjoyed the show pretty much until Valerie left. After she was gone it went downhill for me, but by that time the show was almost over.

While Valerie was my favorite female character, David was my favorite guy. He was a sweet kid from the start, although he has done a lot of stupid things during the show. Most characters had their charm. But even though I liked the show pretty much until the end, when it came to the adult time most of the original cast has lost their charm. I liked Kelly at first, but in the final years of the show I couldn't stand her. Steve stopped being fun but an annoying guy who will have a kid. And when Dylan came back he seemed like an annoying parody of himself.

Still, the show is a classic for me. As somebody who once in a while likes to watch some cheesy soap, this was a good entertainment with a great cast that fitted the show very well and will always be the faces that I associate with the 90's pop culture."
"I admit I haven't watched this show for years, so am going on memory here. I watched every episode of Seasons 1-5. When the quality took a nosedive after Season 4 (but Andrea was still around) I started watched it less and less. From what I gathered the plotlines just got more and more ridiculous. The new main actors were all plain like vanilla, like Vincent Young, Jamie Walters, Lindsay Price, Vanessa Marcil, etc. None of the new replacements excited me at all. (Daniel Cosgrove was not bad).

But, in terms of pure gold, the Brenda years, love or hate the actress, Seasons 1-4, were the best. Season 5 clocked in some golden moments too although I hated what happened to Andrea's character, going from brainy nerd to reluctant mother. After that I wouldn't watch anything as a repeat or catch up on what I missed."
"Several years ago, in 2016 I think, I was grabbed by some nostalgia and I started to rewatch ""Beverly Hills, 90210"". Of course, after three seasons it began to bore me and I moved on to something smarter. Since this month I was in total business and private chaos and I had neither the time nor the concentration to devote more seriously to films, I returned to it again. After the fourth season, I must admit it feels good. When you work from morning to night, seven days a week, this is the right choice to relax before going to bed. I think I'll definitely see it through all ten seasons. Maybe it has no value in an artistic and cinematographic sense, nor in terms of philosophical depth, but it has emotional and nostalgic value for us who grew up in the '90s and it is great for letting the brain out to pasture. And to be honest, it is very well made. Perhaps the stories are Utopian and with fairytale happy-endings, but they also make sense and point. The acting is quite solid and technically there are hardly any flaws. In this genre, only ""Heartbreak High"" beats it.

"Well, growing up during 90210's run, I missed out on all the hype that this show received. Now, thanks to SoapNet, I can watch shows that were on while I was busy playing dress-up.

Let me be the first to say, that I never ever thought that I would EVER watch 90210, or get hooked on it. During a few weeks that I was grounded from my computer, I didn't have anything to do after I did my homework at 5 o'clock, so I turned on the TV. I normally would have put on Angel, but it was an episode I didn't care to watch, so I stopped on SoapNet and low and behold, 90210 was on. Immediately I went for the remote to change the channel but then I stopped and actually watched it. I was HOOKED. Mostly what hooked me was the romance between Dylan and Brenda.

Anyway, mostly what I remembered or heard people talk about 90210, was that it was all about drugs and sex and who was sleeping with who what week. (I don't know if that's true yet, but I have a feeling that it's getting to that point. I'm still in the ""high school years"".) As I watched more of the plot lines going on in the first, second and third seasons, things seemed really familiar. As I looked more at them, I really began to realized that 90210 curved the pathway for today's teen dramas like ""Dawson's Creek"", ""One Tree Hill"", ""The O.C."", etc. Without 90210, these show's most likely wouldn't have been created.

So, the question becomes, do I think 90210 is a good show? So far, yes. But I think it was essential to have something like this (at least in the first few years) on the air for teenagers to watch so that it could make a pathway for other shows of this kind."
"90210 was a place where 8th graders like me thought high school would be: We would all have a car at 16, we would have a hangout spot to eat and dance with no parental supervision and that there would be lots of DRAMA!! 90210 has the campiness of Dynasty mixed with 80's after school specials and more guest stars than the Love Boat! Watch it for the love triangles, the cool outfits, hair bangs and it's fun to see where a lot of actors had early roles. Also the seasons of BB and AB (before Brenda 8/10 and after Brenda 6/10) are like watching two different shows with the same name. Luke Perry will always be a dreamboat. In real life, that was not my high school experience, although we did have a Subway across the street to hang out at senior year."
"""BEVERLY HILLS, 90210,"" in my opinion, is an absolute FOX classic! I don't think I've seen every episode, but I still enjoyed it. It's hard to say which episode was my favorite. It would probably have to be the one where Brenda (Shannen Doherty) has a fight with Kelly (Jennie Garth). However, I think it was always sad when friends fought. I always wanted to cry at that. It would have been nice if all the main characters stayed with the show throughout its entire run. It seems that no one stays with a show throughout its entire run. Everyone always gave a good performance, the production design was spectacular, the costumes were well-designed, and the writing was always very strong. In conclusion, I hope some network brings it back on the air for fans of the show to see."
"Beverly Hills 90210 was an example of a show that was hit because it had a good concept and great timing, becoming popular at a time when shows of its type were really taking hold in America.

I originally watched it at an age slightly younger than the depicted cast (depicted because the real actors are mostly 5-10 years older than their characters), the target demo of the show, and it worked!

I was glued to my tv wanting to know what was next, who was dating whom. But was it actually that good at the time, or was I seeing this show with ""kid eyes""?

After now re-watching the entirety of the series to answer that question myself, I can safely say it's the latter. This show is actually quite bad overall, mostly due to repetitive storylines and inane character actions, but also due to one really horrific casting choice via Mr. Nepotism.

One thing is for sure, 90210 doesn't lend well to streaming. Having a week+ break between episodes must've made them seem more fresh, because watching one after another it becomes painfully obvious they keep reusing the same storylines, slightly different characters or actors involved.

""Who is currently cheating? Who is currently fighting? Who is currently in trouble with the law? Who is currently on drugs? Who is currently trying to woo someone new?"" Rinse, repeat. Repeat. Repeat.

Also, actors leave the show, and yet rather than come up with new plot lines for new people, the writers lazily give the newbies the old actor's stories.

Valerie replaced Brenda, Gina replaced Valerie. Noah replaced Dylan (for a while), Matt replaced Brandon. All were just slotted in with the previous character plots. And so forth.

I also hate how practically every argument or misunderstanding in this series could have been solved instantly if any character literally just said out loud ""Wait, that's not what I meant!"" Boom, disagreement solved.

But the absolute worst part of this series, and the thing that killed it and made it ""less than"" it could have otherwise been, has to be none other than ""Saint Donna"".

It's a fitting nickname, the other characters even refer to her as such at times. But if you watch the show closely as it progresses over time, it becomes more and more obvious Donna / Tori Spelling is controlling the direction of her character, and all must bow to Donna.

First of all, the casting, supposedly to avoid nepotism claims Tori auditioned anonymously, but that's a ridiculous argument because the producers knew who Tori was, she visited her Dad on other sets her ran. And she only got the casting call because of ""who"" she was to begin with. I mean, if she is such a great actress, please tell me about all the roles she got not involving her Dad or her later association with the show. You can't.

But nepotism happens a lot in Hollywood, her casting wouldn't have sunk the show by itself. No, it was the writers later turning 90210 into ""The Donna Martin Show"" by season 6-7, thats when it really got bad. With no Brenda to steal lines, Donna was given more lines / a larger role, and the series just buckled under her inability to carry it on her own. Was this really the writer's idea? Or hers?

Whatever you believe about that, the shenanigans on set led to the exits of Brenda, Dylan, and Brandon's actors.

Ultimately, I'm sad to think how good this series could have been had the original actors and plot lines stayed in place. But, Donna needed more lines, so an iconic tv love triangle was forever left unresolved."
"Beverly Hills 90210 is one of the best drama shows of the 1990's! Especially since this show aired on FOX were most of the good drama shows air. This series is about the lives of a group of high school students living in wealthy Beverly Hills neighborhood, then in the later seasons of the show they move on to their college days as they got older. The kids become friends and enemies, fall in and out of love, and go through an endless series of crises as this small group somehow becomes personally involved in every newsworthy social issue from alcoholism to South African apartheid to pregnancy to AIDS. Jason Priestley was one of the coolest actors on this show and so was Ian Ziering! The best actresses on this show were Tiffani Amber Thiessen and Kathleen Robertson. Tiffani Amber Thiessen was also on another FOX series called Fastlane and Jason Priestley is currently on another good FOX series Tru Calling! I can not believe that this series went all the way through the 1990's! I can't wait until they start putting this show out on DVD!"
"Throughout the 1990s TV's ""Beverly Hills 90210"" (that # is a zip code) was a mega-popular program that spoke volumes to millions of unfocused teens all across the American nation, and beyond.

Put plain & simple - The ""all-important"" message that this series clearly communicated to that decade's lost generation was this - ""If you're not young, beautiful & rich - You're nothing!"" (And, yes, as you can well-imagine, zillions of gullible teens bought into this empty-headed propaganda, hook, line, and sinker)

Literally overloaded with ""rich-kid"" stereotypes - ""Beverly Hills 90210"" absolutely reeked of vicious rivalry, cry-baby angst, and petty personal dramas that had me convinced that one really wasn't any better off coming from a wealthy family, at all.

I cannot believe that this super-shallow series of pretty boys and girls actually ran for 10 seasons. 'Cause watching these 21 episodes from Season One was certainly more than I could stand."
"While ""Beverly Hills 90210"" was making its ten year run, I never watched a single episode. The affairs of rich kids in Beverly Hills really didn't interest me; and, even though Jennie Garth and Tiffani Amber-Thiessan are real eye candy, that wasn't enough to tie me to watching a weekly continuing drama with what I thought would be such an uninteresting subject. However, when the Soap Opera Channel offered the show in sequence five days a week and my wife encouraged me to watch it with her, I reluctantly agreed. I'm glad I did, because ""Beverly Hills 90210"" is, in my opinion, the best written and produced continuing drama in TV history. Why do I say this? Because ""Beverly Hills 90210"" survived two radical format changes and remained consistently watchable for its entire 10 year run. Actually, ""Beverly Hills 90210"" is three different shows: an excellent ""high school teenagers in love"" show; a very good ""college kids antics"" show and a good ""Yuppies in love"" show. The creative talent managed to produce three above average shows with an amazing consistency of story lines and talent, using mostly the original cast. Nobody else has ever done this, at least to my knowledge. The producers are to be commended for keeping the cast remarkable intact, even down to the minor characters. To the best of my knowledge, only one character was played by two different actresses, that being Andrea Zuckerman's grandmother. Compare that to the more prestigious soaps, ""Dynasty"" and ""Dallas."" On ""Dallas"" alone, two actors played Gary Ewing, Digger Barnes, Miss Ellie and Kristen Shepherd (who shot J.R.), and three actors played Jenna Wade, and all of these characters were more important to the show's plotting than Andrea's grandmother.

While all three shows are above average, the ""high school teenagers in love"" episodes are the best. However, I believe they were also the easiest to plot, since teenagers have more restrictions on their behavior and their problems are generally more direct, easier with which to relate and generally easier to resolve. This is only slightly less true for college students, but it's a whole different ball game by the time one gets out of school and into the ""real world;"" and, by the time these episodes were written and produced, the characters were no longer fresh. The loss of Shannen Dougherty (""Brenda Walsh"") was the series first major blow, and the series slipped badly her first season away (the fifth). However, after a weak start, Tiffani-Amber Thiessan (""Valerie Malone"") became a very impressive cast member. However, Shannen brought an inventiveness to the series which was never regained.

The second major blow the series suffered was the loss of Kathleen Robertson (""Claire Arnold""), at the end of ""the college years"". While other original cast members had left, including Gabriella Carteris (""Andrea Zuckerman""), Carol Potter (""Cindy Walsh"") and James Eckhouse (""Jim Walsh""), I felt the loss of Kathleen Robertson the most. Kathleen's ""Claire Arnold"" was a fascinating blend of three of the main characters; she exhibited Brenda's daring, Kelly's poise and Donna's madcap sensuality. The show lost a lot of it's warmth with Kathleen's departure, as well as the (unfortunately) correct decision to place less emphasis on the older adult cast members. This happens in life as well as young adults leave school and are out on there own. The show also lost it's innocence when Donna (Tori Spelling) lost hers to David (Brian Austin Green).

The final blow to the series happened over two seasons. The departures of Luke Perry, Jason Priestly and Tiffani-Amber Thiessan badly shook the show, but for very different reasons. Luke Perry (Dylan McKay) brought a lot of romance to the show; Jason Priestly (""Brandon Walsh"") brought a brash, crusading spirit; and Tiffan-Amber Thiessan brought a wholesome, mature sexiness that was sometimes at odds with the character she played. Worse, for their first seasons at least, the replacement characters, Vincent Young (""Noah Hunter""), Lindsay Price (""Janet Sosna""), Daniel Cosgrove (""Matt ) and Vanessa Marcel (""Gina"") while all fine actors, did not bring the missing ingredients to their characters. While Season 9 was clearly the worst of the season (due mostly to unconvincing plotting), Season 10 was a triumph, starting strong and getting better every week. Lindsay Price shed the somewhat dowdy image of his first season and a half and showed how beautiful and sexy she can really be (not to the mention, the best natural figure of the female stars). Daniel Cosgrove gained stature as ""Matt""; and, while never acquiring the ""Brandon brashness,"" certainly captured Jason Walsh's earnestness. Most importantly, warmth and romance returned to the series. I watched the last episode wanting more and that's a great testimony to any show.

Here's my rating of the series pilot and 10 seasons

PILOT  ** ½ SEASON 1 - *** SEASON 2 - **** SEASON 3 - **** SEASON 4 - *** ½ SEASON 5 - ** ½ SEASON 6 - **** SEASON 7 - *** ½ SEASON 8 - **½ SEASON 9 - ** SEASON 10 ****"
"This was the most popular show in my country in during the 90s it was watched by everyone from teenagers to pensioners Brandon and brands could have been elected president of the world for their popularity. This is how most of them world though america was (especially behind the courtain boy wore they wrong)

Speiling obviously knew what he was doing.

This show was rebooted several times without it's success.

If someone wants a reminder of the 90s a rewatch of this is a must."
"I was watching the show every week, waiting 7 days for new episode. I watched it again in 2010. Again at 2015. Now it's time for the 4th time, 2020. Every time i have this incredible feeling that i am again kid, waiting for my mom to scream ""Turn off the TV and do your homework"". Awesome days..."
"I went back and watched all seasons since I didn't finish them when I was younger. I still felt some type of way when Brenda left and felt like the show took a huge loss when Doherty was gone. Tiffany Thiesson was a nice addition and kept the show alive with her drama. I felt like having her take everybody's leftovers was just lazy writing, as well as the whole crew playing musical boyfriends. In real life, girls don't remain friends when our friends date our exes. It would have been nice to see women of color play a main lead or long term date one of the main guys, but of course it seems that every time a black character was introduced, it was in some type of agonizing stereotypical sense. Wrong side of town, dangerous, angry; then there's the one where the single mother leaves her kids home alone to go to work and the white people are there to judge and play savior. It is what it was for those days and for the times that it was for television. Most plots were written well and the actors did a great job in their roles."
"Baywatch is bad too. But in a different way. Baywatch is like driving on a mountain road. There are potholes, ravines, twists and turns. You never know when you'll suddenly meet a fallen tree, or be inches away from a 100 foot cliff. You will crash. It will hurt. But there's variety. The disasters are various, sundry, and exciting. New ways of being terrible every time.

Beverly Hills, 90210 is like getting stabbed with a fork. Over and over. Same fork. Same place. Every 44 seconds for as long as you watch. It hurts like hell. And it's boring like hell. Again and again. Stabbed with the same fork in the same place. Fork. Stab. Fork. Stab. Fork. Stab."
"After watching the entire series, I like a number of others, have gone back to watching season one's episode. It doesn't take a Rhode Scholar nor a T.V. expert to see that this series 1st was created to center around the Walsh family.....Brandon and Brenda in particular. Eventually it started to create equal story lines and exposure of ALL of the main cast members. In the 1st season Brenda hooks up w/ hot H.S. prospect, Dylan McKay. Of course it was revealed that McKay wasn't supposed to last in the series. But as we all know he later hooks up with Kelly Taylor. It's written later on that Dylan and Kelly have known each other since elementary school.....and Kelly described Dylan as being ""a guy she's had a major crush on her whole life""......causing so many fans to view them as the true soul mates with the hot chemistry between them. I was personally saddened at 1st when Dylan chose Kelly over Brenda. I will always prefer Brenda and Dylan just like I will always prefer Brandon and Kelly.

First season, Donna was such a minor character. Her rise seemed pretty obvious. First you usually saw Brandon and Steve or Brandon and Dylan as 2 different set of best buds. It took awhile before seeing the 3 together let alone just Steve and Dylan with no Brandon. Of course we see David Silver grow from being the freshman geek to the accepted cool guy. Andrea's character also grew. She seemed like she could have been outcasted at 1st.....pretty much just Brandon's friend. But in the end she was very much accepted and respected as part of the gang.

I am an older, afro-american male. I mention that to say that a number of people wouldn't expect me to gear towards this show. But I love this show and always will forever!"
"7 because it has a catchy theme song.

Other than that its just about white people who are in relationships and drama happens so instead of solving it they become jerks to each other. Where have I seen this premise before?"
"From the opening scene, this show delivers fashion and stories with romance and edgy storylines. Not too controversial but mixed with 50s era concepts and classic Beverly Hills fables. The best show on Fox by far."
"I have always adored Beverly hills 90210, since I was a kid. Brandon, Brenda, Kelly, Donna, Andrea, Dylan, David, Steve, Clare, Valerie & co accompanied me through elementary school years, then high school, then life. This TV show is certainly the best of the 90s decade(if not the best ever!)and the new 90210 has nothing to do with it, really: it is just a boring, full of clichè and pale imitation of something that was almost flawless. The characters of the Original 90210 are so real that they manage to make us believe they really exist, somewhere in the amazingly beautiful Beverly Hills. We all feel we know deeply each of them, we all feel that warm sensation when we see their well-known faces on TV or on the page of a magazine: it is pure nostalgia. We all know by heart the amazing OST song and we miss them all now that TV shows characters mostly look like shallow, boring, selfish people with no ethic or good feelings inside, it is only a matter of ""appearing""; maybe that is the portrait of what we have become nowadays, and this is more than sad. I still dream of meeting friends like them (and living in Beverly Hills, of course!), I will never forget what their adventures meant to me, to all of us."
"As a pretty engaged Batman fan (I read the comics, played the heck out of the Arkham games, saw all the movies, the first Animated Series and I even play the tabletop miniature game) I was apprehensive about this show.

After all, what could be good about a Batman show without Batman? Not to mention the fact that all the rumors mentioned different takes on characters, etc?

I tried it anyway... and I'm glad I did!

There is an awful lot to like here. First of all, the characters are interesting: interesting enough to make you forget all about Batman! You root for Gordon, you're annoyed at Bullock, Fish gives you the creeps and Penguin... let's just say he's moved up in my favorite villains list (and he was near the bottom, let me tell you!).

The acting is great (again I must mention Penguin) and while some have said it's over the top... maybe it is, but it's never distracting and fits within the universe that we're presented with.

As I mentioned above, the series has its own take on the universe - you'll soon recognize certain characters, even though they're introduced in ways that are different than what you knew from the comics - and yet, even as a seasoned Batman fan, I was never bothered by the differences and enjoyed the fresh perspectives on familiar characters.

Also, don't worry about the writers shoe-horning in characters, just to get them on screen. Every character I've seen makes sense within the series.

The first season (which I'm basing this review on) has overarching plot lines, but occasionally has ""freak of the week"" episodes. I was never bored, though (as I regularly was when watching Flash or Arrow) and it's obvious the writing went towards longer plots when it was clear the show was doing well. It never steeps to ""cop show"" levels, which is an achievement.

Finally, I must commend the ""atmosphere"" of the series. It all feels very ""Gotham"", including the shots of the city skyline, the sets, the extras... it all comes together feeling very Batman, without actually having Batman in the mix...

Do I have any criticism? Not really, no. I would love it if they do a Batman series to tie into this one... there's so much they could work with.

Go see it and enjoy it!"
"I though Gotham did a great job at building the world of Batman as he grew up and before he actually became Batman. Jim Gordon (Ben McKenzie), Harvey Bullock (Donal Logue) and the villains were all the real stars of this show. The only weak link is the actor who played Bruce Wayne (David Mazouz). He just doesn't come off as someone who can play a tough guy or beat people up, quite the opposite actually. All his fight scenes were so unbelievable and actually made me laugh. But overall the show is very good and worth watching!"
"Gotham chronicles the life of a young Bruce Wayne growing up and young detective Jim Gordon as they take on a corrupt Gotham City. I though Gotham did a great job at building the world of Batman as he grew up and before he actually became Batman. Jim Gordon (Ben McKenzie), Harvey Bullock (Donal Logue) and the villains were all the real stars of this show. The only weak link is the actor who played Bruce Wayne (David Mazouz). He just doesn't come off as someone who can play a tough guy or beat people up, quite the opposite actually. All his fight scenes were just so unbelievable. But overall the show is very good and worth watching!"
"I've never really watched any batman related stuff before except BatMAn trilogy of Christoner Nolan, so I don't really have any expectations on what characters should be.

Season 1 is decent, boring forgettable characters, the mafia bosses were super lame even Gordon and Bullock didn't do anything memorable, all I cared about was what Penguin, Master Bruce and Alfred would get up to, and they had about 10 minutes of screen time every 2 episodes.

Season 2 however is way better, probably the best super hero show for that season. Some very interesting villains come along that actually do stuff for a change, they start killing about 10 red shirt cops every week, and you feel like the characters are actually impacting the story and the city rather than which mafia boss runs the local fish and chip shop from season one.

Season 3 and Season 4 reached Pinnacle of Awesomeness.

Not a Comic Reader, so I found the TV series too good."
Gotham is a unique and wonderful insight into the famous city before the birth of DC's most beloved hero. The show mixes comic book content with their own twists. On top of that they have one of the most talented casts on tv. To name but a few Ben McKenzie is an excellent lead as the young Jim Gordon. David Mazouz is a young man with extreme talent and handles every storyline that comes his way as Bruce Wayne grows up. Sean Pertwee is an ass kicking and witty version of Alfred to rival all those who have gone before. Whilst Robin Lord Taylor and Cory Michael Smith are nothing short of extraordinary in their portrayal's of the infamous Penguin and Riddler. Highly recommend it to any DC and in particular Batman fans. I love it and long may it continue!
"I must say, if you have an...average opinion of season 1, I don't blame you. The show was decent, good at times but it lacked continuity and it had way too many ""Villain of the week"" scenarios and all the side story lines were seen as irrelevant mostly.

Now after watching a few episodes of Seasons two, I can say that just the first episode is way better than maybe the entirety of season 1 ( maybe a stretch but I just think it's amazing ). So if you are done with Gotham after the first season, please give it a go as I feel that the makers of this series have injected some new life into it and it shows in every episode so far."
"I've been very frustrated by Gotham. The premise is solid. The characters are interesting. The actors are generally excellent. The atmosphere is wonderfully seedy. The overall story arc of corruption is quite good.

But from episode to episode, the quality varies widely. Much of the problem is the crime-of-the-week format. While the various side stories are generally quite good, the main investigation is often rather dull. And that's a huge hunk of the show. Gordon himself is a decent character but he's less interesting than Penguin or Selena or Nygma, yet gets more screen time than all of them put together.

Some episodes are great, and most episodes have great segments, but at times (as during the dreary, 3-part, serial-killer episodes), I've considered giving up on the show altogether."
"Jim Gordon (Ben McKenzie) is an earnest new police detective in the corrupt Gotham City. His girlfriend Barbara Kean takes a turn into darkness. His partner Harvey Bullock is revealed to be a weary veteran willing to work within the corruption. There is Bruce Wayne, the billionaire orphan, with his butler Alfred Pennyworth. Selina Kyle is a street kid who finds connection with Bruce. Oswald Cobblepot is a minor crime figure who rises to the top. Edward Nygma is the police tech who goes mad for riddles.

The show was initially sold as Batman without Batman or Gotham with young Jim Gordon. It's actually teen Batman before Batman. It's a little weird to have Catwoman/not Catwoman, Joker/not Joker, Penguin/not Penguin, Riddler/not Riddler. What may be worst are the non-comic book characters. The Balloonman in the third episode is probably the quintessential new character. It's odd. It's a valiant try but it doesn't work. It doesn't fit as drama or comedy. I actually don't mind Jada Pinkett Smith as Fish Mooney but she struggles to fit as the tone keeps changing. Eventually the show figures out how to be an alternate Batman verse. Cameron Monaghan as Jeremiah Valeska is the high point as Joker/not Joker. Robin Lord Taylor is consistently great as Cobblepot and probably kept more of my attention through those first two inconsistent seasons. It's a shaky start but the show eventually finds its footing."
"Season 1, season 2 was epic it' sucks after that bad story writing, villians keep reviving again and again and it keeps repeating somehow managed till season 4 couldn't take it anymore what a waste of time. This series is over-rated asf"
"Gotham has long been the TV show many like to pick at, its first season, while compelling was mostly a mundane origin tale. Happy to report that since that time, the show has evolved into something really special. Lavish, atmospheric set pieces, great performances and a constant drift from episodic story arcs are just a few qualities to love about this show. Moreover it does justice to many comic book characters that everyone knows. While it does face some tonal inconsistency and gets the villain-of-the-week treatment on occasion, at least it builds its characters and does proper justice to them."
"What a fantastic new take on classic DC characters and stories. A cast chalked full of new face actors and actress's, that are only no names for the time being most of these new actors really have the chops and have delivered very strong performances since season 1 episode 1. This show is stylish, smart, and wickedly entertaining. It does have some plot lines that can be comparable to soap operas but again the acting. Costumes, scenes designs, and creative camera work makes up for that."
"Gotham is basically about how Jim Gordan along with his accomplices solve homicide crimes, etc. If you think it's about Batman, you're wrong.

I was skeptical to watch this show, as I thought since Batman would not be there, it'll be boring. Well, I found it later I was so wrong. So Wrong. It got me hooked on.

I watched a couple of episodes and it wasn't too bad. I started watching more episodes, then I loved it. You really don't need Batman actually. Many villains come such as the Penguin, etc are there in the show . Penguin is portrayed by Robin Taylor ( Oswald Cobblepot ) . He surely deserves an Emmy for his acting. I also loved the acting of Cory Michael Smith ( Edward Nygma ) . He's bit a weird though, with all his strange riddles. Nonetheless, he is great. Ben Meckenzie did a good job in portraying Jim Gordon . I think the acting of Jada Smith was a bit too much. Sometimes it was just too bad but at times it was good.

Well, I must say Gotham is a very promising show. I simply LOVE it. I hope they also renew for many more seasons. Again, I would suggest you to watch at least the first three episodes."
"This is a rather entertaining and intense TV show starring Ben McKenzie as a young Detective James Gordon. He sides with justice and attempts to ride Gotham City of corruption, really bad guys and supervillains - all before the arrival of Batman.

It's very interesting seeing the introduction of each characters, especially that of a young Bruce Wayne and the villains before they became The Joker, Penquin, Riddler and Catwoman. Lots of intriguing episodes about the sources behind Gotham City's corruption, making the plot unpredictable and suspenseful. Action is a little overkill though, and the acting goes from too monotone (Ben McKenzie) to overzealous and overindulged.

Not a bad show, overall. Eager to see how everything unfolds.

Grade B-"
"I've been binge watching this show on Netflix right now. The storyline is okay, but each season feels painfully long and painfully slow. I think a 16-18 episodes per season could've told the entire story arc they wanted to show, removing all the painfully slow story progressions from 4-6 episodes.

I really wanted to give this show an 8, but man, it's hard to give it an 8 once the filler episodes start to kick in. Also, villains keep on dying and being resurrected everytime is such a pain to watch. They are just making a fool of the audience.

To be fair, the acting is good accross the board.

If you're into psychopath villains, this one is for you. I was never really a fan of such villains, but this show really changed my mind. Most of their villains are well written, to the point that I liked them more than the heroes - Penguin, Riddler, Barbarra, and Dr. Strange and awesome villains."
"Of late, I have realized that TV content is getting developed much better than movies and I find myself binge-watching many recent TV series than movies. This is happening all the more because of the gripping and taut story lines (TV shows, given their length, used to ramble on about the plot, but thankfully no more) and brilliant overall delivery.

Gotham stands out even amongst this new wave of brilliant TV shows. The first season of Gotham exuded brilliance. Tight direction, brilliant (overkilling this word no?) acting, fantastic casting and this amalgamation is truly one for the ages. Every cast member seems to be perfect for their role and they deliver and how!!

Without giving much away, Jada Pinkett Smith, you ma'am are as much of a powerhouse performer as your famous husband! What a performance by her! Every scene she is in, she totally steals the show. Robin Lord Taylor is mesmerizing in his role of Oswald Cobblepot. I found the entire cast to be perfect and the above two were mentioned for no particular reason but for their sheer brilliance on screen.

As a fellow reviewer, I too thought another 'Batman Begins' won't be much fun but I did expect some detailing seeing this is a TV show. But was I blown away! This was more of a Jim Gordon Begins or more correctly, Ascends kinda story. This storyline works perfect for this show as gradually the different villains are introduced in their own chilling manner (and man, the violence and mafia story lines are a delight) and gradually build up to why Gotham would end up needing a masked (and caped) crusader! Anyway, that's where I hope the future seasons are going. A lot to look forward to in Season 2 of Gotham and boy it sure looks promising!"
"The one thing that always kept me from enjoying the Batman films and series for as far back as I can remember are the villains, who all come out of sheer left field with little-to-no rhyme or reason and then the ""dark side"" of Batman, which honestly doesn't seem too ""dark"" aside from the drippy cave and all-black costume+accessories.

This Junior-League style prequel to the Batman story does such a nice job of setting up the Bruce-Alfred storyline and the Bruce-Cat storyline. If the producers could have just left it at that, with the simple underground councils/corrupt board in the background and the relevant training of a young Bruce Wayne (no spoilers) the series would have done well enough.

Alas, the story goes way overboard, making overly complex back stories for ALL the villains that end up making them annoying rather than frightful. Does EVERYONE have to die and be resurrected? Does EVERYONE have to own a bar and vie for what seems to be evaporating into a little dung heap called Gotham? What's the motivation? By the end of Season 4 the series has become exhausting to watch.

Sorely disappointed with everything except Sean Pertwee, Ben McKenzie, David Mazouz Camren Bicondova and, of course, the really remarkable sets."
"As the title says it isn't necessarily for Batman fans, this show is mainly about detective Gordon and his investigations. I would sum this up as more of a show like CSI with a Gotham theme. It's dark gritty and grotesque. You see the true nature of Gotham and how dark the city actually is and why Batman in the future fights to keep it safe. Very interesting show, but if you're looking for that signature high flying Batman style action, it likely isn't for you."
"The only thing preventing this masterfully crafted series from getting a perfect rating is the fact that its virtually impossible to have a flawless show over the phase of 100 total episodes. However to call Gotham underrated would be an massive understatement. The brooding, yet lively aesthetics, the multi dimensional characters, the exciting action sequences, and the engaging storytelling make Gotham an must watch television series. Robin Lord Taylor's portrayal of Penguin in particular is the standout performance, however virtually every villain, the riddler, joker, poison ivy, scarecrow etc, are perfectly portrayed, and certainly stand as the highlights of the series as a whole. However there is a strong philosophical message inherent within the show, beyond the action and flare, about law and order, justice, moral lines, and the greater good. The storytelling is another aspect the show perfectly nails. It isn't easy to nail an amalgamation of different narratives to create coherent television, however Gotham succeeds, engrossing the audience with its emotional resonance, and creativity. However, despite being one of my favorite shows of all time, Gotham isn't without its flaws. There is sometimes an excessive reliance on filler and ""too much"" substance which prevents the narrative of the series to flow more smoothly, and occasionally bogs down the pacing of the series as a whole. Furthermore there are sometimes one too many plot elements which slow down the series resolution, and prevents the series from spending more time on critical and more intriguing story elements. However despite the flaws inherent within Gotham, the series has all the elements which make engrossing television. Interesting characters, an engrossing narrative, and a central element which always pulls the audience to watch more, the city of Gotham, which in and of itself, with its enigma, visual beauty, and dilemas, stands as a character in and of itself."
"A show set in the Batman universe.. except without Batman? A lot of people didn't like this concept but i was one of the people who did. I wanted to see the villains' rise to power most of all.. but how would they be interesting with no Batman to counter them? Well that's where the early years of Jim Gordon come into play. The show follows Jim as he cracks strange cases whilst trying to help a young Bruce Wayne solve the mystery of his parents' murder. It seemed each week for a while we would see a new villain come in and act like they run Gotham City before Jim and Harvey Bullock shut them down, but it turned into more than that.

After a while the show did start to feel repetitive and i wanted to see more focus on a single villain that on a bunch and we ended up getting that by the end and i absolutely loved the finale, but before we talk about that let's talk about what i liked less. Over the course of the series we were introduced and hinted at early incarnations of villains we could expect to see. Scarecrow, Poison Ivy and even The Joker have been hinted at and whilst these are some of the best Batman villains i feel that they should have been left for later series' and that this series should have focused on three particular villains who i will talk about later. The biggest gripe for me was hinting at Jerome being the Joker.. Joker is obviously a big deal in the Batman universe and i feel without Batman being introduced then Joker should be left well alone, but also early hints to Bruce being Batman felt shoehorned in, i feel less focus should be drawn to him and the Batman references as well as the awful cat puns from Selina Kyle should have been toned down a huge deal.

However, i do feel Gotham is a very entertaining show to say the least. It is ridiculous and some of the characters act even more cartoony than they do on Batman: The Animated Series which is saying a lot. This isn't so much a bad thing because the show knows how ridiculous it is whilst still maintaining a gritty feel to it and i give it props for that. The acting is over the top but Ben McKenzie as Jim Gordon and Donal Logue as Harvey Bullock are absolutely true to the characters (especially Logue) and play well off each other. The villains i mentioned are Fish Mooney, a new character who isn't in the comics played by Jada Pinkett Smith who brings a stylish yet creepy edge to her character, she was one of the best on the show. I also loved Cory Michael Smith as Edward Nygma, his slow descent into becoming the Riddler was at times shoehorned in but when it worked it was incredible, especially in the finale. The absolute stand out of the show however is of course Robin Lord Taylor who plays Oswald Cobblepot/Penguin. My god, he gave one of the best performances i have seen in TV for years, he made me root for the Penguin's survival and the Penguin has always been low down on my list of favourite Batman villains (that is until now). If anyone can be praised for single handedly making this show work and bringing a whole heap of crazy, ridiculous yet incredible acting skills to the table it is Robin Lord Taylor who honestly deserves a lot more work. He has clearly earned it.

So no, Gotham does not go without its flaws and characters such as Edward Nygma should have got more screen time if they were to be introduced now to let their characters develop but i expect series 2 will open a new set of opportunities for them which i look forward to. If Jerome truly is the Joker though i'm not sure how i would feel. The finale, without spoilers, was very satisfying to me. Some of it felt maybe too ridiculous such as the scenes with Dr. Lee and Barbara but overall i was entertained and am intrigued to see more so that is always a good sign. A fun show that doesn't take itself too seriously. It doesn't quite scale a show like Daredevil but it doesn't exactly try to and it also gives us one of the best characters in recent TV with Penguin.

8.5/10"
"I know, i'm late. Anyways, it's a decent show. Like in every show there are ups and downs, and the more it goes on the more downs there are. I however did not like ""the making of Batman"" plot. I skipped most scenes with Bruce Wayne because i wanted to see what the villains are doing. Detective Gordon story is meh. At first it's fun but it gets old after a while as it's always going in circles. However, the last season is NOT the worst season. In fact i found it more fun than some seasons in the middle of this show.

You should give it a try. I'm not a comic book fan so i can't look at the show from that point of view."
"A futuristic world of stolen bodies (sleeves) and wins to be made right.

There are many threads to this complex tale, but enjoyable even when I lost the plot (due to ADHD not poor production).

The main characters are a cop with a fiery persona and a newly awakened criminal of epic proportions.

The attention to detail in mortice and world building were fantastic and well thought out.

Fantastic multilingual characters, religion vs science vs justice, fast paced action, humour, mystery and nudity. All the facets you need for dystopia.

The second season didn't rock my boat, but after season one was anything going to stand up? Probably not. Will I watch season three? Absolutely."
"By far the best series Netflix had come up with. Absolutely incredible visuals. The story line is deep and grabs you. It's violent and erotic and there are so many levels that makes this show worth watching. If you liked ""The Matrix"" then you will love this show. First season is the best but the second season is still incredible. The acting is solid and you have to watch each episode or you will miss out on vital keys to the story line. I said it before it is ultra violent and there are some very difficult scenes to watch. You can tell they spent a lot on this and that's why there was no 3rd season. Trust me. Give this show a shot."
"First season is great fun. Actors do a great job selling characters, action is fun, atmosphere and aesthetics are top notch.

Second season... Exists. Mackie didn't even bother acting."
"I can't say enough how much I absolutely loved Altered Carbon, especially Season 1! I loved Season one so much I just binged it for the second time recently. I know a lot of people didn't like Season 2 but I didn't think it eas that bad. It's just not close to Season 1. Joel Kinnamon and Martha Higareda were both excellent in that first season. They also had a fantastic supporting cast filled with good actors like James Purefoy, Chris Conner, Will Yun Lee, etc. This is a must watch for any sci-fi fan but even if you're not a big sci-fi fan this show is still worth checking out. Bottom line...is Season 2 as good as 1? Of course not, it would've been nearly impossible, but it's still a decent show worth watching!"
"First season is very good probably 10/10 after 15 mins you cant stop watching until the end , but the second season is 1/10 after 15 mins you want to stop and forget about it..."
"Season 1 of Altered Carbon is among the greatest Sci-Fi shows ever created so of course Season 2 wasn't going to be as good but it's still not nearly as bad as some of these reviews are saying. It's just that Season 1 was so incredible that when people compare S2 to it they are of course going to be a little disappointed. If season 1 never happened I think more people would like season 2 but because that first season is so amazing people automatically compare them. Don't. Everything about this show is great...the acting, writing, production, cinematography, etc. Are all as good as it gets. It's really too bad they only did two seasons because it's one of the better sci-fi shows I've ever seen."
"I am NOT a fan of science fiction, which Altered Carbon is, but I thoroughly enjoyed season one. The main actor was fantastic, the concept was interesting, the images were beautifully done and were a feast for your imagination combining both futuristic concepts while still incorporating retro ideas and images, and the script was such that you were rooting for the protagonist. I loved the idea of the Raven hotel with its Poe A.I. host. Having the A.I./human hate to friendship allowed for some nice growth over the season. Some of the rich vs poor social commentary was interesting and not as trite or black and white as you would expect. This had a everyone roots for the underdog vibe from the get go. I liked that they didn't insult the audience by explaining everything from the onset, it gave your mind things to puzzle out, which kept you engaged. Watch season one, you will not be sorry...even if you are not a sci-fi fan. My 7/10 rating is for season one only...you can stop watching at the end of season one and you will have a nice complete story. (I really wish I had stopped here.) Season Two- If I were rating season two I would give it one star, but only because you can't give negative ratings on IMDb. This was one of the worst things I have seen in the last couple of years and it was particularly disappointing because season one was so good. It really left a bitter taste in your mouth and has tainted to a certain degree how I feel about Altered Carbon all together. The show runners made some horrible choices of actors for season two, I think they were more concerned about checking boxes than actually delivering good content to their audience...which is a shame because they could have probably checked some of those same boxes by making some different choices and delivered a solid good quality show. Instead there was horrible and horribly delivered lines/dialogue by some pretty terrible actors...and clearly not as much energy was put in to plot/story development. The story was not engaging or entertaining...it was a snooze-fest. It also lacked new and interesting images...it didn't even keep the interesting images from season one (which shouldn't have cost them any more money to re-use!). The only thing that I liked from season one that they kept was our hotel Raven...but our poor Poe A.I. Is messed up. The only small glimmer of hope and microscopic light was found in our newly introduced archeologist A.I., but they managed to sour that before the end of season two as well. Please, please do not watch season two. Friends don't let friends watch season two!"
"All I have to say, is that season one was much more tightly written. Fewer characters, better director.(s) better cinematography, better camera manipulation? It took me a while to watch season two based off of my trust in those who said it was nothing like season one. But eventually I decided to watch it. I love the lore of altered Carbon, but season two was way more bloated and sort of directorially all over the place. I really can't emphasize the fact that it was such a bloated eight episodes. Which really makes sense when you watch it. But I really do love the first season. It goes down in history as far as on my favorite seasons of any show ever."
"The change in main actor was a big fail. But it's more than that... it's like I am watching a different show, one with a lower production quality all around... I guess the action choreographs are still up there at least, but the lighting, the sets, the acting, some kind of filter or something on the camera, feels like a downgrade... the scenes feel empty and hollow, the dialog lacking... really makes me wonder if so much of the appeal of season one was the main actors... Damn too bad. I was really looking forward to this one. I thought I would be ok with the change in lead... guess I must not be.."
"WTFH?? I mean it can't have been the lead's salary as I'm sure season's 2 actor, after the ""Avenger's"" and the other many roles, demands as much, if not more than season's 1 unforgettable run, throughout. So, what happened? Production design, cast, cinematography all seems to be at about the same level, except it's not isn't? Went from iconic to exhausting, and it's definitely not the lead, as he was just in the remake of that awesome 90's PS1 game, in which he was both funny and charming, and was able to carry the series' first season mostly by himself. So, the writing seems to be the most obvious suspect, and most likely guilty party. Also, it seems a gradual decline, as with every episode, it seems and feels to get worse and worse. What a trite conclusion to a story that began with such promise, specially amongst such ordinary, clone-like, series and films, in a whole sea of copycats and unoriginal content. Hopefully one day it'll be resuscitated by the right team."
"They did the series a disservice by miscasting Kovacs in season 2. Anthony Mackie is a great actor in his own right but failed to capture and continue Joel Kinnaman's and Will Yun Lee's take on Takeshi Kovacs. Takeshi is a serious Japanese guy and that didn't translate.

This could have been Anthony's opportunity to show his acting range. All I could think about was his Falcon character in the Marvel movies.

I'm so sad they cancelled the series, I really loved the idea of the immortality of consciousness."
"Honestly, season 2 feels like I am watching a cliche sci-fi show without any noir/ detective/ dark feels. These are the things that made season 1 great and you guys completely removed them in the followup. Please don't make season 3 if you are going to make it like season 2."
"Which idiot thought it was a good idea to ditch the actor who carried this series and made it into a success? WTF?!? Joel was and still is perfect for the role! Bring him back ffs!

Season 1 rating: 10 stars Season 2 rating: ugh ..."
"Arguable one of the greatest shows of all time and so little recognition. I wish I understood how shows like this don't gain the views the so deserve. This show takes you places and feel so much more than a production of sets and VFX. The ENTIRE cast delivered, in my opinion, awardable performances. In life we see and experience things that sometimes just manage to harness the ""right stuff"" and makes your interaction with it a wildly satisfying interaction of emotions and thoughts. I am not quite sure how Season 2 commanded a less rating than Season 1, they were both great, but Season 1 mastered the art of delivering a story and universe in an instant to the viewer. I hope everyone involved in making this production come to life continues to bring magic to Hollywood."
"Watch season one , watch it or 3 times... its such a great show. Do not watch season 2, its blatantly obvious funding was pulled the main actor cannot carry a show like this it is like watching cardboard... I was so disappointed that they ruined this."
S01 is one of the few series that I had to watch twice. Wow. S02 they tried to improve on perfection and made a heck of a mess.
"I dropped my rating from a 9 for season 1 to a 6 for season 2. The story is quite weak compared to season 1 and the acting is notably worse. The fight scenes are boarderline amature at best. The only redeeming character is Poe, he's great."
"Season 1 of this is one of the very best science fiction TV series ever. Honestly, season 1 is the spiritual successor to Blade Runner 1984. Its absolutely amazing. Vastly better than the Bladerunner 2049 garbage sequel.

I had massively high hopes for Altered Carbon as a series based on season 1. Unfortunately season 2 was utter crap by comparison. I like Anthony Mackie as Falcon, but he is terrible as Kovacs and the writing of season 2 is garbage.

But still, season 1 by itself is AMAZING and anyone who hasn't watched it should stop what they are doing and immediately watch it. Its fantastic. Just stop after season 1 ends (unfortunately).

Altered Carbon season 1 is the r3eason I kept my Netflix subscription. If they could come out with something this good just once every year I'd keep it. But they haven't since this. I sadly hope they will make a season 3 and it will be more like season 1 but I'm probably delusional at this point (sadly). If they made a new series of this that was even remotely as good as season 1 I'd love it and stay. Hell, frankly, I'd pay $250 to have a UHD copy of Altered Carbon Season 1 permanently. But sadly my hope is nearly dead in Netflix and I'm very close to cancelling after having been a member for ~20 years."
"Season 1 was excellent. While it had its flaws, the story was interesting and the world was immersive. Season 2 is just boring. There's no real coherent story of any interest and the visuals, while decent, are nothing compared to season 1. It's as if most things are shot in different small rooms or outside with a color tinted lens. I found myself falling asleep, having to force myself to rewatch scenes so I knew what was happening...all while not really caring about the story at all. The writing in season 2 is just awful. I love sci-fi and hope this is picked up for a 3rd season, but only if they do it right. If they're going to just string together another boring, incoherent story, they might as well not bother continuing the series."
"I'm reviewing Season One. Season Two might as well be dead to me.

I'm a long-life, lifelong sci-fi fan. This (S01) is one of the best Sci-Fi shows I've ever seen.

Once you get your head around the premise behind the show (the swapable bodies thing), it's what they DO with it that makes this show so awesome. The ambience, the tech, the concepts, the quality of the acting, the beautiful sets and visuals they're all first class.

Then you get to the plotting, scheming and mystery solving which add a dimension of cool and clever to the pretty visuals.

The portrayal of the many important characters, their personalities, aspirations and motivations, not just Kinnnaman as Kovacs, sets the calibre of the show so high it's almost a bar which other sci-fi shows should aspire to reach.

It's a true masterpiece of science fiction.

The second season takes a nosedive in the opposite directions.

It's abysmal.

It would seem that neither the Director, Producer, script writer nor any of the actors in the second season saw any reason to make the second season have any tangible connection to the first.

How can they NOT understand the concept that if you effectively transplant the mind of a man into another body he's going to be the exact same person... in another body ???! He doesn't undergo a body language and personality transformation into someone completely not him. Within seconds.

I don't know whether to blame terrible directing, terrible scriptwriting or terrible acting or a combination thereof, but the second season is just awful. Somebody made a horrendous mistake with the second season.

The first season was so superb it deserves somebody COMPETENT re-doing the second season so we can all forget that the Mackie abomination version even exists and maybe even move on to further seasons."
"This series is one of the best I have ever watched. I hope Netflix will make more episodes and TV series like that. The actors are acting beautifully, there was no (actor)character I didn't like. Some of them even playing multiple roles in a very convincing way. There is a lot of nudity in this series, but if you can see violence I don't think that nudity should matter. But it definitely not for children. The TV-series brings up a lot of ethics and moral about humanity, in the end, I don't think we are very far from this future.

If the cast and the staff reading this I want to thank you for this series and also to Netflix."
"3* goes to Season 2!!! AC first season was 11/10! The best in the past decade! And I was waiting so badly and so long for season 2, but after watching it, I'm so disappointed!!! Season 1 with Kinnaman and Purefoy and that fantastic world and flawless script was the best ever. Netflix really made it, probably on real cost!

But season 2 is a budget, boring, childish story. And without Kinnamann and originals script writers it is only 2/10!!!"
"I haven't read the novel upon which this show is based, so I can't comment on whether or not this is a faithful adaptation; I am, however, a huge fan of the sci-fi subgenre commonly known as ""cyberpunk"" (in case you're not familiar with the term, think of films/stories set in an urban, dystopian high-tech future like 'Blade Runner', 'Akira', 'Ghost In The Shell', 'Strange Days' or 'The Matrix' and you get the idea), and as such I can absolutely testify to the fact that 'Altered Carbon' is one impressive looking example of that particular brand of science fiction.

What stands out right from the start is the worldbuilding. Many of the characters have complicated backstories that are crucial to the plot, and the rich history of their world is equally important, but what this series does remarkably well is show rather than tell. Instead of relying on lengthy monologues for exposition which have a tendency to weigh a story down and make the narrative lose momentum, we get the clues we need via flashbacks or just by seeing and learning about this world through the eyes of the protagonists. And what a world it is: the production values are insane, especially considering this is a TV show. There is so much eye candy for a sci-fi nerd like me; nearly every shot is packed with such an abundance of visual information that I had to hit pause several times to take it all in.

But the world of 'Altered Carbon' isn't just ""decorated"" with visual effects and future tech to make it look cool (though it DOES look very cool); everything we see has a function and is there for a reason. It feels real and has that ""lived-in"" look that even big-budget Hollywood productions rarely get right. What I should probably also mention is that this is a hard R-rated show (if this were a feature film, it would actually perhaps be closer to a NC-17 than an R) which doesn't hold back in terms of sex and violence. Also, if you're not familiar with the genre or used to a more straight forward narrative where everything is explained to you, 'Altered Carbon' may initially feel a bit confusing or even overwhelming, because you're being thrown head first into a strange new world where you - like the protagonist - have to process an overload of information in order to get a sense of orientation. Stick with it though, and things will start to become clearer.

As for the plot itself, I won't give anything away here; it's enough to know that it starts with the protagonist being brought back from ""retirement"" to solve a murder mystery. But unlike the grand daddy of all cyberpunk films, 'Blade Runner', this has less of a brooding, ""noir"" vibe to it; instead it's an action-heavy, at times pulpy but very densely plotted story with lots of colorful characters and so much going on that it doesn't drag for a second.

To sum it all up: for sci-fi and cyberpunk fans this show is a must; for all other carbon-based life-forms, well, it may not be an ""altering"" experience, and it certainly isn't perfect, but if you don't give up after the first couple of episodes you could be in for a nice surprise. 8 stars out of 10 from me.

"La casa de papel started as a promising bold show. The first and second season had amusing and strong plot. Well defined characters and a storyline that could certainly catch your attention. The duel and chess between the protagonist and antagonist was surprising and full of ups and downs. Of course there were plot holes but you could overlook them in favor of the overall strength of story. The whole idea was bold and well developed, all and all, the ending was satisfying and well-written too.

But then came the third, forth and fifth seasons. The ones that Netflix actually created. The strong amazing plot turned into a cheesy foolish joke which was written by a class of third graders, and the smart kids weren't in the class!!

What a shame. There are so many problems with these seasons that I don't know where to even begin. Unnecessary flood of new characters whom you cannot relate to at all. The plot which was filled with surprises became totally predictable and utterly boring. You can watch a trick pulled again and again until it becomes a total cliche, but even then the writers won't let the worn out trick go away. Romance subplots are awful in these seasons. There are so many plot holes that you would wonder is it even possible to fit in any more? And as the plot gets more boring And flawed, writers just pour more gunfights into the story in hope of saving it, but it's a futile attempt, the gun fights are even worse than a bunch of stormtroopers trying to aim straight!

So please do your self a favor. Grab some popcorn, watch the first two seasons, but then forget that the rest of the show was produced. Save yourself a good memory of a great amusing TV series, which was ruined for us by watching the last three seasons."
"I've heard about how good Money Heist is since it started back in 2017 but for some reason I kept put off watching it. I finally gave in and started watching it recently and now I can't stop, it's every bit as good as everyone says it is. Some of it is absolutely ridiculous but that won't stop you from having fun watching it. The writing and acting are both excellent, there are so many twists and surprises that it will keep you on the edge of your seat and guessing throughout the entire series! It's a Spanish show but you can either watch it with subtitles or watch it dubbed in English. Just a little warning...once you start watching it it's hard to stop, you'll want to binge it as quickly as possible!"
"Season 1 and 2 were great and amazing, I'd say 9/10. But then Netflix saw a chance to make money and prolongued this show into 2 unnecessary seasons that completely ruined this show. I'm just sick and tired of this by Netflix. This last season was a disaster, filled with unrealistic stuff. Stop before it's too late."

"All my friends were talking about La Casa De Papel (I really don't get why you have to call it Money Heist) as it was the best series ever so I was really curious and excited to watch it. I waited a long time to start watching it but once I started I binge watched the first four seasons. So yes I admit it, it is addictive, you can't help to want to know what will happen in the next episode. That said the plot itself is sometimes very far fetched, in other words it would never happen like that in real life. The Professor thinks about every move the police will make, and that's fine, but sometimes it's just very unlikely and just a bit exaggerated. For that alone I can't rate this, for the rest excellent series, with a higher score. The cast is really good though, every actor did a great job, from the most annoying one to the heroes. Everyone will have their favorite character, some will die and some will survive, that what makes this show really entertaining, the not knowing what will happen. I strongly advise you watch this show in it's original language Spanish instead of watching it dubbed. It only adds to the excellent acting. I once tried to watch a dubbed thing, it's just awful, and I really don't get what people like about lips being out of synch. Can't wait for season five, let's bring it on."
"I found this Spanish TV series by chance, I really recommend you watch it. It's one of the best series that I have seen lately. A chess game between the police and the robbers, you will be surprised by its development. You can not foresee anything. (I hope that my review is correct, I'm not a native speaker)"
If you hear about this webseries but you didn't watch the masterpiece webseries then go and watch this masterpiece. I will bet you will watch this webseries in month one of biggest fan of proffeser. The acting and skill I watch no one can perform proffeser like alvoro moroto . He is very clever in acting and flim also . All character are connected and there is one compared abou webseries. Bgm is also famous. Bello ciao is one of the best and all time famous ot the narrator tokia and other are well connected we get emotion aacctament no doubt I webseries is end it's my first and one of the best web series of my life.
"I usually pick-up any TV series with thorough analysis after reading 20-30 reviews. But this one I picked randomly just because I liked the sound ""Bella ciao Bella ciao"" (you'll know what it is once you finish the show).

I bing watched it for almost a day because this damn thing is so fast paced & keeps you awake as if you're on a rollercoaster ride. The plot twists/ the anticipation/ direction/ oh boy 9/10.

Professor gave justice to his role. What a legend. You'll get addicted to the show and you'll start admiring some characters while hating the others. Seriously I got so much involved in the show that I started cursing some of the characters. Who thought a TV series on a money heist will be so interesting. Kudos to the creators.

Bella ciao Bella ciao Bella ciao ciao ciao"
"""Money Heist"" is a Spanish crime drama series that has gained a massive following worldwide. The show presents a unique and captivating story, filled with tension, suspense, and thrilling moments. The characters are well developed, with each of them having their own backstory and motivations, which makes for an engaging viewing experience. The show's cinematography, soundtrack, and attention to detail also contribute to its high production value. However, it can sometimes feel like the plot relies too heavily on certain conveniences and coincidences, which can detract from the overall realism of the story. Nevertheless, ""Money Heist"" is a highly entertaining and well-crafted show that is definitely worth a watch."
"If they could have stopped in season 2, this series would have been the best ever heist series that's ever made. But they didn't do it and season 3 and season 4 is meaningless and boring. Not convincing and illogical."
"To be honest, I am a biggest fan of this particular series. Each episode carries the suspense, and makes us more eager to watch another episode on the same day/time. I personally love the character of The Professor, mean while I admire the intelligence of Berlin and Palermo. The Director, had Characterized these Characters very well, and each situation grabs the pulse movements. Am very grateful to the director of La Case De Papel (Money Heist). In recent times, I got to know that there will be a Prequel of Money Heist i.e., Berlin is coming on December-2023. Most Awaited for It. Welcome Back Berlin!!!"
"What started off as a superbly intelligent and gripping drama series has slowly but surely fallen into the Holloywood trap of treating it's audience as if they are complete morons (sadly a growing market it seems).

If new to this, savour Seasons 1 and 2.

3 and 4 are OK, but by season 5, just take your brain outside and put a bullet in it before watching, there are plenty enough on offer.

Plot entirely replaced by countless hours of shootouts with literaly thousands of mostly non-lethal bullets fired, occassionally interspaced with drawn-out cutaways to superflous and mostly idiotic emotional drudge...... and that's about it !

Difficult to rate overall - 9 to the first two, and 2 for the last. So have gone with a 6."
"Well, the writers and producers outdone themselves. They started with a good idea, intriguing characters and an elaborate plot. By the end of season 2 it became apparent they could not drag this anymore. Season 3 was just a ""remake"" of season 1 but, my God, season 4 is an awful soap opera...seems almost like a ""filler"" season...no actual plot, no actual action...you could skip straight to episode 7 if u want and still..you wouldnt miss a thing. Hire better writers, because this cast is impeccable."
"Watched 8 episodes yet but took only 8 hours. Couldnt stop watching with all twisted episode ends. Intro video and music amazing. Directing and acting is fine. (Im not used to Spanish show, so.) Story keeps getting you everytime with every new information. Impossible to get bored. A well designed heist plan, extended through season. We're slowly learning plan steps one by one. that keeps couriosity high. i wonder how its gonna end. Hope doesnt take too long for Netflix to air part 2. we need closure and we need it now."
"Congratulations to the actors, director, writer and anyone who made this season of episodes possible. Every episode had it's gripping and human slow moments, such a wonderful balance. Couldn't wait to see the next episode. Each one had surprises, no standard script, which is so enjoyable. The actors played so well, better than many of the better known Hollywood names. Hope the next season is coming up soon."
Could not stop watching this series. What an excellent set of actors fully into their roles in a natural way. Refreshing storyline unlike most other movies or series about bank robberies. Can't wait for season two
"This has been a real treat! An amazing series, great acting, direction and such a suspenseful story it's really one of the very best I've seen ever. I love heist movies and I just found this one in Netflix and I literally couldn't stop watching through the night. The characters are simply amazing! Don't miss this!"
"Some fellow critics think themself to criticise it but they even know about what it's about. If you want to watch the show without spoilers i can guarantee your goosebumps and emotions. Intense drama makes you on the edge of the seat experience. I have watched GOT,Breaking bad etc series but i first I watched this series there is nothing compatible with this. I still want these types of shows looking for but cant get that intense and heart pumping and blood pressure increasing shows.

Finally I can only assure you that never hear the fellow critics now do yourself a favour watch this goddamn show.

A kind suggestion if you loved this watch prison break also you must live that too."
"One of the many great series on Netflix depicts a group of people breaking into Spain's national mint. ""La casa de papel"" (""Money Heist"" in English) is a series that you just gotta see. Rapid-fire dialogue, clever editing, and all sorts of twists and turns make this one of the best shows out there."
"It is a great non-hollywood european series. It is well paced, well directed, actors are selling their characters well mostly. It is a pleasant romantic fiction adventure, with a superficial revolutionary message which will make you probably have a good time if not biased. It is generally well done in most aspects, esp. If you consider that it is spanish. It's not a 10/10 and certainly not 1/10. What I mostly read here is bipolar reviewers based on their personal feelings which have to do with their expectations due to hype,or other things that have nothing to do with reviewing the show."
"With some engaging characters and a money heist script with several twists, this started off SO WELL!!!

Unfortunately, however, it would seem that sometime during the first season someone realized they had an audience they wanted to keep around for a while, and from that moment on, it went downhill, quickly. Like a marmalade that will only go so far, they began to water-down the story in order to spread it out for as long as they could make it last, ultimately making it almost unappetizable.

What seemingly would have been a masterpiece if allowed to run in its predetermined time, pace and format, became a stretched-out mess and with so much stretching, something had to give. As in a bad, pieced-together tapestry, this developed so many glaring plot holes that even those who are best blessed at being able to suspend belief in order to enjoy a tv series or film, will eventually find it tedious and disheartening that one needs to do it so DAMN MUCH to keep this story on the rails. Not only are there innumerous plot holes, but the telling of the story grows more and more formulaic by the episode, and is way too often preposterously predictable.

The acting is give or take, and while some of the cast excels, others do not. Worse, still, the characters much like the original title (La Casa De Papel), lack real substance and are merely paper, molded as the scene requires, rather than being given lives and backgrounds and breath and purpose of their own, even though they spout about ""purpose"" almost ad-nauseum.

Then there is the fascination which the creators seem to have with either the actress who plays Tokyo (Úrsula Corberó), or with the character itself or with what Natalie Portman's character in Leon the Professional would have grown up to be like (in their minds). In an effort to make an appealing character, which both men wanted and women could relate to, they bent her into a parody of a damaged superhero with psycho tendencies; an over-the-top, non-sexy, raging-hot, flip-the-switch temper; mommy-issues; street-bike stunt capabilities; good or bad, fighting abilities (depending on the scene); and oh, yes, a heart of gold or titanium or slush, which needs tending to and healing, also depending on the scene. In short, in wanting to create an amazing, powerful lead character, they morphed her into Frankenstein with sultry eyes. She reminds me of the quote from Pride and Prejudice: "" I never saw such a woman. Surely she would be a fearsome thing to behold."" A miss in my book. Raquel too, (played by Itziar Ituño), was denied the opportunity to be at least a somewhat balanced character, but unlike Tokyo's character which is purposefully built up, Raquel's character is a plot device which is torn down repeatedly and made to look ridiculous in many situations in order to further the script. The other characters in the first two seasons, Berlin especially and also The Professor, are written well (with the exception of THAT plot device in seasons 3 and 4 which I will not go into here). The rest of the main cast is pretty likeable on an interchangeable scale. I would be remiss not to also mention José Manuel Poga who plays César Gandía and Najwa Nimri who plays Inspector Alicia Sierra in Seasons 3 and 4. They are two of the toughest 'tough guys' I've seen in a series and do great in their respective roles.

Both despite and because of this, Money Heist (terrible change of title, by the way) engages you - ESPECIALLY AT THE BEGINNING OF THE SERIES, because it is a whole, undiluted, rich story at the beginning - with fluid, deep moments of brilliance, that unfortunately, come around less-and-less often, until we barely see them at all.

If you are intent on watching it, listen to the bad reviews and go in with very little and low expectations - perhaps you will then, like those who first discovered it, be surprised and will enjoy it. If you go in expecting much, you WILL be disappointed. It rolls over, like a gigantic wet blob, over its' own hype."
"Great story, directing and fantastic acting. You cannot stop watching!"
The more u watch it.. the dumber it gets.. idea of the plot is good. Direction is just like a soap opera.
"MacGyver is synonym for resourceful and creative. If you look those words from the dictionary, you'll see MacGyvers photo and a text: dude, who can make anything out of a roll of duct tape, dental floss and some loose pieces of stone.

That's the whole basic idea for a show. MacGyver (Richard Dean Anderson) is a secret agent, or something, who uses his brain before his brawn always coming up a clever solution on dispatching the baddies without the need of using a gun. Though he might do explosives now and then. ;) Mac's boss is Pete Thornton (Dana Elcar), boss of Phoenix foundation, that seems to dabble in a bit of everything, just like Mac. Another regular character is Jack Dalton (Bruce McGill), Mac's adventurous pilot friend who is often in trouble or is gonna get in one in order to help his friend.

What astonishes me is, that MacGyver has lasted the test of time reasonably well. Sure, there are lots of episodes, that feel a bit campy these days, but in all the series is still very watchable. And this comes from a person, who saw MacGyver for the first time back in 80's as a little kid (I was little under ten when it started in the TV here) and saw the series again in my mid twenties."
"MacGyver was so cool and inventive he had us all believing that we could get out of any jam with a paperclip and bubble gum. Everything he did was scientific and he was the closest thing to a cool scientist I'd ever seen. Even to this day, if someone does something creative with simple items I compare them to MacGyver."
"This is original; a James Bond for kids, or a boy scout yet in the spy business. Whatever the definition of it, (MacGyver) was a pure gold from the 1980s.

For being the actor who was unafraid to use his glasses during the audition, showing a lack of pretension that the show makers wanted in their lead--(Richard Dean Anderson) made it to be the title character. And how he portrayed it fine as innocent and intelligent secret agent that became one of the most memorable characters in TV history. We were waiting him, on the Egyptian national TV (channel one), every Wednesday night. Since the opening credits' electronic, nice and catchy tune, we gather craving what kind of scientific tricks he would come up with this round. It is a real cult favorite, and - strangely - the show which I've never met anyone hates!

At first, the episodes were close to the American super spy's adventures. Therefore it was ordinary at one point to watch (MacGyver) landing from a fallen plane, with a beautiful girl, in a hanging-to-a-parachute convertible car. It's the fanciful propaganda however through unique character of unarmed hero where ""mind is the ultimate weapon"". But this character itself, so its distinct resourcefulness, prevailed eventually as the attraction's core more than any ""save the world"" kind of Bond plots. Even (Dana Elcar) as (Pete) was having the most childlike face ever been for intelligence boss.

When the Cold War drew to a close in the late 1980s and the early 1990s, (MacGyver) became like a social worker who deals with family issues more than secret agent with ticking bombs, to watch him just saving a troubled kid from killing himself and stuff. At that phase of the show, there were these episodes where the lead traveled into time, by mysterious dreams, to live some different adventures in other lands and times; since his very time became that boring! But these episodes managed to be magnificent as well.

The excellent episodes are many. For instance, I can't forget ""Phoenix Under Siege"" where (MacGyver) was fighting an evil man in one building in such limited time pre-Die Hard. Or ""Target MacGyver"" where he unites with his grandfather to face some evil gunmen in a deserted cowboy city with just simple wiles. Or ""Good Knight MacGyver"" where he travels into time, to live a hellish night in the age of King Arthur.

Back when the show was on, I remember reading that some people accused it of presenting lies more than scientific facts at times (something got to do with generating electricity by cactus!). But anyway, we just believed the show as a show, a very engaging and entertaining one too. And the important meanings that we've learned from it were: Always be prepared. It takes a lot of study first to be a hero. So many wonders can be made by one Swiss army knife. And yes, brains can beat brawn.

Sure you'll ask: why there are no shows like (MacGyver) anymore? But with whole 7 seasons, the saturation was inevitable. Though, this spirit and these thoughts became old fashion nowadays. I believe that making a show for both kids and grown-ups, that enjoys and teaches them in the same time, turned out to be a lousy idea now in the 2000s, especially with the forensic medicine's too many bloody shows that may originate 3 types of generations later: forensic doctors, serial killers, and serial killers' victims!

Finally, I want to assure a little point of view. I used to list the shows that I watch, and then chronicle them by their production's date. So, if you knew that (Amazing Stories), (Moonlighting), (The Equalizer), (Spenser for Hire), and (North and South) were all products of the same year of (MacGyver)'s start (1985)--then you must admit: that was a happy golden age for TV.

Are the 1980s cool or what?"
"Okay, here's yet another one of my famous nostalgic-experience stories from my youth.

I'm writing this in 2002. I was born in 1976, so that means when ""MacGyver"" premiered in 1985-- I was nine years old. My father and my older brother used to watch it, but it never really kept my interest as I was too young to understand and appreciate the intelligence and physics of everything. MacGyver-- along with ""Hill Street Blues""-- was blown off by me when it started... only to be embraced whole-heartedly by me in my teen years.

When I re-discovered ""MacGyver"", I was in junior high, and had begun watching it on a daily basis in syndication on the USA Network. It came on at a great time-- 5pm. I was out of school by 3:30 every day, and had plenty of time to get home to watch it 5 days a week. True, I saw the same episodes over and over again, but I loved it so much, I didn't care.

One of the best things about this show is that MacGyver was the perfect role model for young guys who grew up watching the show. He didn't smoke, he didn't drink, he gave his rewards to charity, he never swore or got angry, he hated guns, and he used his WITS to get himself or others out of trouble.

--and ""MacGyver"" used an aspect not seen (to my knowledge) since the days of Sam Spade... the show used ""Film Noir""-- basically, you hear the person's thoughts in a voice-over while they're doing what they're describing.

Now, I can appreciate the biggest complaint about this show: some people don't like it because it's unrealistic that a man could make an explosive device with a lightbulb, a paperclip, and some cleaning supplies. Yes, some of the ""MacGyverisms"" were eye-rollers... especially in the series finale-- when he and his newly-found son escape out of some kind of pit by strapping fire extinguishers to their backs and setting them off. Yes, that's stupid. But come on, people! This is SEVEN YEARS of thinking up MacGyverisms! They can't ALL be gems! But most of them were REALLY clever and REALLY worked!

I know for a fact that this show inspired me to be a better, more-helpful person to others... and to use my mind to remedy situations. I've tried to watch ""Stargate SG-1"" with Richard Dean Anderson... but it just makes me sad, because I want to see the long hair and the brown leather jacket with the red plaid interior lining.

From what I understand, ""MacGyver"" is only playing at 10am Monday through Friday on WGN (a Chicago station) nowadays. USA dumped it (jerks) and I haven't seen it since. But I'm dying for another reunion show. I miss Jack Dalton. (Bruce McGill) I miss Pete Thornton. (Dana Elcar-- who's gone blind from Gloucoma, bless him) Both are fine, fine actors who added greatly to the show.

But... sadly, all good things must end. It's been off the air for years, but I still think about the show all the time.

If you've come here for a review to see if the show's worth watching, it absolutely is. Let your kids watch it. It's a wonderful influence, and I think you'll really love the outcome you'll get from letting them watch it. Hey, watch it yourself. You'll probably get hooked too."
"This show had a kind, intelligent, athletic, good-with-his-hands fellow from Minnesota (bonus: he is good-looking). I cannot ask for much more than that. The show was funny, good hearted and adventurous all at once. It should have gotten Emmy nominations but I think it was unique for the time. Now, shows that are similar are finally getting recognized.

The first five seasons were really the best; the last two seasons went for surreal moments of going into Mac's dreams and back in time. But, overall, it was always worth watching.

Once this baby is on DVD, I am doing all that I have to to own it!! Hopefully, someday soon...."
"MacGyver is a bonefide 80's classic and stands out as one of the best and that's really saying something considering the decade was absolutely awash with these kind of family oriented action adventure series. You had Knight Rider, The A Team, Magnum P. I, Scarecrow and Mrs King et Cetera. However, what really sets MacGyver apart was his seemingly never ending resourcefulness when in a tight spot. His counterparts would use a gun or his muscles to escape the bad guys, But MacGyver always used his wits and seldom used his fists, which meant that MacGyver as a show was always on the lower end of the scale when it came to violence.

Richard Dean Anderson played MacGyver, a government agent of some description sent on missions by the government, usually to some far away place with a strange sounding name to either rescue someone or something and with a dislike of guns, he uses his ingenuity to achieve these goals.

For instance, nine times out of ten, this would result in MacGyver being captured by the bad guys and incarcerated in a room with nothing but seemingly innocent objects like a dry twig, a coffee bean and a paper clip and MacGyver would use said objects to construct some kind of tool, weapon or radio to affect his escape. It sounds foolish, but it always leaves the viewer more than impressed with the results.

I've watched a lot of those 80's actions series and MscGyver feels completely different to the rest of them and I have finally realised why. This show, although American, has an old British ITC feel about it. It reminded me a lot of those 1960's and 70's actions shows that ITC were known for like The Persuaders and especially The Saint as it has the same narration by the main character, a pre credit sequence and the fact that Saint writer Terry Nation even wrote and produced some of these episodes makes that association stronger.

If you're looking for some family friendly action TV without too much violence, the. You really can't go wrong with this show. It's like James Bond meets The Great Egg Race. (If you're British you'll know what I mean). However, always go for the classic 80's series and not the 2016 remake which was a bit rubbish.

Enjoy!"
One of my favourite shows. I like when he made stuff out of things
"Magnum PI, Knight Rider and MacGyver is all you need for action pack TV adventures.

All 3 are basically the same thing. White guy has the skills of Captain America and solve cases and wins a girl in each episode."
"This is a fun show about secret agent MacGyver, who has a vast knowledge of science and is quite the handyman. He is able to make use of any mundane materials around him to create solutions to the problems he faces while out in the field.

This show is full of action and adventures from start to finish - great acting and suspenseful stories. I especially like seeing MacGyver using his unorthodox scientific measures in getting himself out of desperate situations or helping him solve issues he faces. Forget the usual conventional action stuff like weapons and firearms - this show uses anything from tools to bubblegum.

This is just the perfect kind of action TV show that is not over-the-top or overly violent, but can still attract many viewers with its good guy vs. bad guy elements and unique case-solving techniques.

Grade A"
"MacGyver was lots of fun, kind of like The A-Team which debuted before MacGyver. So much fun with MacGyver demonstrating his awesome DIY skills to the max without breaking into a smirk or ironic smile."
"Growing up in Norway in the 90s with only four TV channels available, this was the coolest thing on television at the time and for it will always have a special place in my heart. I recently bought the DVD collection and I rewatched the entire series. It's. Undeniably cheesy and unrealistic, the acting is questionable and the plot is not particularly impressive. But that's kind of what you expect from these types of shows. My favorite episodes will always be the ones involving Murdoc. Not gonna lie, he still scares the living !%&? Out of me just like when I was a child."
"As a kid, I was brought up with a couple of TV-heroes that I adored over all, and that I wanted to be just like. One of these heroes was special agent/survival-expert Angus MacGyver, a guy that, unlike other action-series heroes, didn't grab the nearest firearm when things got hot. For him, an used paper clip, the wrap from a bubblegum, a spring from the bottom of a rusty old bed and his trusty Swiss army knife (which has become MacGyver's trademark) would do the job.

The thing with MacGyver is that it's original. Rare to any other series today, it focuses on the brain instead of brute force, which is actually a good thing, considering that television today is heading for a more ""brains-off, action-on""-attitude. Angus MacGyver hates weapons and therefore never uses them, but instead, combining limited resources, he finds simple and elegant ways of dealing with the problem at hand. And the best part is, that (atleast in theory) MacGyver's inventions would really work, making it even more fascinating (even though some of them are not to be recommended to try).

Admittably, some of the episodes may not feature the best acting according to modern-day standards, and some of the ideas and solutions may be slightly used up, but seeing as the series aired in the mid-80's, I don't find it in anyway disturbing, rather the opposite, I find MacGyver to be a true treasure among the TV-series of today, and I recommend it to anyone who enjoys wit, humor and a good time spent getting surprised by the geniousness of MacGyver's contraptions!"
"I've grown up with Macgyver, and since I was a kid I've loved it! Now this is one of the rare 1980's action series, were the hero doesn't just pick up a gun and start shooting at his enemies. In fact MacGyver never kills at all, and this I found very inspiring as a kid as well as now.

And the fact that he does not always simply knock out the bad guys with his fists, he use his brain and ingenuity. Truly ""His mind is the ultimate weapon"". And the fact that all of his ""inventions"" work in real life (although I wouldn't recommend trying some of them) just makes the show even more incredible and also to some extend: educational.

In many ways Richard Dean Anderson created the persona for MacGyver and I think that most would agree with me, that if any other actor were to portray him, it just wouldn't be MacGyver at all.

Now MacGyver is the kind of hero that no one can hate, and that we all should look up to. The show is both very entertaining and morally inspiring. This is and will always be my favourite TV series."
"I'm 16 years old but that doesn't mean I can't appreciate one awesome show. Macgyver is simply put, the most unique and amazing idea for a show I've ever seen. He used no guns, no cussing, minimal violence (just what was necessary to get the job done), and was always teaming up with some sort of organization trying to help society. The show never gets tiring to watch...well I still haven't seen all the episodes yet but I'm working my way through the DVD collection.

There is one thing that's going on nowadays that I really don't like...all the Macgyver stereotypes that are so off the mark, it upsets me. Example:

""Macgyver can make a bomb with a piece of gum, a pencil and a paperclip.""

That is the most incorrect statement I've ever heard. When you find the episode with that in it, come to my door with the episode in your hand and we'll watch it together and see who's right. It saddens me to see that sort of thing happen these days. For one thing it's incorrect and for another, it's discrediting all the amazing ideas Macgyver had for getting out of tight situations. Sure Richard Dean Anderson himself didn't come up with the ideas, but I'm sure they had some pretty smart scientists working behind the scenes.

All in all this is one fantastic show that I will continue to watch for years and years to come. I recommend it to anyone interested in watching an extremely entertaining show that sets a good role model for anyone from small children to middle-aged adults."
"Tiny spoiler.

Richard Dean Anderson has gravitas. If not for his talent as an actor, I don't feel this would have survived to seven seasons and a few movies. The first few seasons see Mac globetrotting as an agent for the Phoenix Foundation...until the show got massive budget cuts and production relocations. After that, he basically hangs around the local boy's club and does odd jobs. By the end, he's even sold his houseboat! How sad."
"Every Tuesday my family would gather around the much-loved soapbox to watch attentively what MacGyver was up to that week. It was so much a part of our lives that people back home had MacGyver haircuts and once my little brother who was just four was so afraid of an episode that my dad had to explain that it was just a TV show but my brother was not convinced so my dad lied that he had even taken part in the show and that outside of it he was our real dad. Almost twenty years later, it is still a family joke. Nevertheless i think that in South Africa, in a time when we were experiencing harsh racism my family was able to enjoy few things and one of them was MacGyver. Moreover today as a journalist who faces crime reports ever so often, i find that message of anti-firearms in the series would be beneficial to today's society that is plagued by gun violence. I would love to see another episode of MacGyver and hopefully someday there would be a reunion. After the series was taken of the air, being a creative thinker i used to often come up with lots of endings but these days all i can remember is Richard Dean Andersons hopeful smile and truly the series made me believe that the ultimate weapon is one's mind."
"I watch this show when i'was kid and it was great show and i'still does.MacGyver is the best show i can say from 2 till 7 season i was never boring.Season 1 it's not got like the rest 6 seasons but i'can say that the season 7 was the best ever made.Some episodes were good and some were bad.But MacGyver was always ready for adventure and action.In this show the best characters in this show were Pete Thorton Mac's best friend and boss, Penny Parker,Mac's girl friend,Nikki Carpenter other Mac's girl friend,Jack Dalton Mac's best friend always get Mac'into trouble and Pete hate's him,Murdoc Mac's great rival and the Coltons' Jesse,Frank,Billy and Ma Colton.Mac always help people when they were in trouble in one episode Mac help a prostitute a young girl who she were on the run from home in one episode he help Lisa a teenage girl who had a drinking problems in one episode he help a high school student to not to drop out a high school in one episode he helped a student and his father who try to commit a suicide in one episode he blamed him self for Mike his girl friend s death and Nikki try to helped him and Murdock try to kill him in one episode he help a young hockey player to make the right chose.MacGyver never use a gun,he hades drugs,hades alcohol and he use his ultimate mind and his bright ideas to stop the criminals, he us his Scwich knife and he was always ready for adventure, i'want just know why they stop the show after seven years and Baywatch last for eleven years or maybe they sad it's time to move one.I'can say that MacGyver was the best action adventure of the 80's and it still is.I love Mcgayver and i always will."
"This is another one of my favorite TV shows of all time, and of course it's another of my childhood relics to this day is timeless to me.

As a kid I was really into the action films and TV shows, the 80's to me were just a golden age for that genre as we got plenty of memorable ones. This show was literally the first I saw and still the best action series in my book.

It's true that this show isn't complex, nor is it totally serious but that part of the charm of this show to me because just like in the action pulps it was a show that was concerned about being just plain fun.

Each episode was always something different, where MacGyver was always somewhere else either some far away locale or even someplace in our country and wherever he went you know there's trouble that he has to deal with. And, each of the situations are always something different, and in each there is a limited amount of time to deal with them.

This gave the show an unpredictability and suspenseful factor because I remember during the episodes, when a new life or death situation risen I was always on the edge of my seat wondering as the minutes and seconds were ticking; how the heck is Mac going to get out of this one, does a solution exist? Or even after an episode was over and I had to wait next week for the next one I was always exciting wondering where Mac was going to go and do next.

That theme song is awesome, it is one of my favorite theme songs of all time, even like how that title sequence is put together as you see an explosion with the Title and some scenes of Mac in action it just pumped you up for excitement and let you know your in for a wild ride.

And of course the characters are great, from the supporting characters like Pete Thorton whom I think is great, he's like the kind of boss we would all like to have. I really love how he's a two fisted boss that has a gruff charisma and also what's really cool about him is that he sometimes participates in missions so he not a desk jockey.

Jack Dalton is a lot of fun as he's basically the transporter for Mac and Pete. Not just does he participate in the missions to help his best friend Mac out sometimes but what's really funny about him is how he is always getting himself into get rich quick schemes which of course always land him into loads of trouble and grief for both Mac and Pete.

There are even some other supporting characters as well as a couple of villains that reacur which also make the show standout because back them that wasn't a common thing as it is now.

The villain Murdoc whom is one of my favorite fictional villains, Murdoc is basically the antithesis to Macguyver much as The Master is to Doctor Who. I really like his name which is ironic as it kinda sounds like Murder which is what the character is a master off. I love it when both of them square of with each other, it's like a chess match as both are pitting their intelligence's against each other. Where Murdoc engineers situations of death that seem foolproof, MacGyver has to always disarm them.

Of course the best character is MacGyver, he's one of my favorite fictional protagonists. Mac is just awesome, he's basically a modern day pulp hero much like ""Doc Savage"", ""The Shadow"", ""The Phantom"", ""Buckaroo Banzai"", ""The Rocketeer"", and ""Doctor Who"".

MacGyver is great because he kinda feels accessible, he almost the kind of hero that any of us could be. I love that he doesn't use guns or really rely on muscle except for his own brain which I think is a great message showing that you don't have to have muscle or lethal weapons to be a hero. It is just always amazing how he is always using logic and science to get himself out of predicaments and thwart his enemies and their schemes. It's true that not all of those scientific solutions would work in real life, let alone it seems convenient that all the things he need to do what he has to would be there. But I feel that's part of the charm and is true to the pulps as they were always concerned about doing and fun and put logic and realism on the shelf.

But Mac has this easy going charisma, I really like that he got lots of hobbies like myself which means he's always active and doing things. He can be a bit reluctant like myself as he doesn't ask to be in certain circumstances that occur but he always willing to do what he has to because no one else can.

And he's kinda a role model as he exercises selflessness, as he does volunteer or help out in certain outreach programs, which kinda makes the show a bit of a civics lesson.

And of course the action is great from seeing Mac getting out of the sticky situations and the fights. And there are plenty of memorable episodes like ""Partners"", ""Jenny's Chance"", ""Murder's Sky"" which has one of my favorite battles of all time seeing both Mac and Luke go against a gang of thugs in a parking garage, guess who wins.

Just like a great working invention MacGyver works well and keeps on giving.

Rating: 4 stars"
"Richard Dean Anderson never acted. He just showed up. Thanks to gum, Swiss Army Knife tweezers, and random fishing line and duct tape, he could disarm nuclear weapons and make gasoline from a wet fart.

I never could warm up to him, and his cast of imaginary players from an unknown organization that got its funding from inventing Silly Putty. His boss was generic. His best friend was the really bad actor from Animal House. Another guy from the ""Just Show Up"" school of acting.

The only reason to watch this show is for background noise. If you are walking by when MacGyver is putting together something made out of pencil erasers and chewing gum, it is worth a laugh."
"This show was excellently written and cast. Richard Dean Anderson was by far the best person for this role and he brought the character the attitude and look that added to his ""no drinks, drugs, or guns"" outlook that was inspirational and enjoyable for all ages. It'd be refreshing to see another show like this come along, but I don't believe it will.

MacGyver focused on the incurable do-gooder who couldn't say no to someone in trouble, and he always had a scientifically sound, absolutely brilliant solution. He was always as optimistic as possible, and he wasn't one to immediately jump in bed as is the norm for most television. His compadres always added to the action/adventure/comedy, and throughout the season you learn new things about the characters that add so much more depth to the story.

Quirky, smart, clean, nostalgic and full of age-less values... (the mullet and leather jacket didn't hurt either) MacGyver will be around forever, and well it should be."
"I cannot even began to describe how awesome this show is. Firstly I would love to point out I am 25 years old and as I type this I can say today was the day I finished watching the last episode of MacGyver. The series is truly amazing. Yes, it's a little cheesy at times and may be slow paced (Example is some episodes from the 1st season) for those who like the explosion/special effects but the plot behind each episode has *always kept me on the edge of my seat (*Minus a few).

MacGyver isn't your typical hero and is willing to go all out to complete a mission. A self-sacrificing person who gets used or taken advantage of because of his personality *cough* Jack Dalton. He's witty, knowledgeable, always getting into a tough situation that he's gotta 'MacGyver' his way out of and lastly he's a fun character that'll have you cheering and laughing. He's a character that might take a few episodes for him to grow on you but once you start watching it's hard to stop and you soon find yourself learning more about MacGyver and seeing that his personality never changes as the seasons progress.

I happen to stumble upon this show right before I went in to have all 4 of my wisdom teeth removed and was desperately looking for something to watch for the next few days while I laid in bed. I won't lie, the first few minutes of MacGyver had me yawning but then I soon found myself sucked inside the show, wanting to know what happened next. I bought the whole series on DVD after watching the first season.

All in all, I love this show and would have had a loved to have seen a season 8."
MacGyver was a unique and fun show...Richard Dean Anderson was perfect in the lead role and was also great in Stargate SG-1. Most of the episodes would get at least an 8 rating...the only thing about this series that I didn't care for was the soundtrack. For some reason it was annoying to me...sounding kind of cheap...but that's my opinion. I just bought the series on DVD and will get the see the episodes I missed in the original broadcast.
I mean why she has to poke noses of all. She is out of nowhere character.
First season brilliant. Second was alright but the third is awful. You can't add a new character and make her the main part. I hate her and can't watch it because of her. Going by other reviews I'm not the only one. Whoever wrote her part needs punishing
I just wanted to thank the crew and actors for making this show possible! I am a grown man and I was very emotional during the whole series (more so during the first season what happened to Hannah) but it really got me emotionally. I think it was the most emotional show I watched in my life! I normally don't write these but bravo to everyone part of this show!
It would've been best if the series was left at season 1.
"13 Reasons Why started strong, interesting and haunting in its first season, having me on the edge of my seat and fully interested at all times. It was super gripping, well-done & well-acted and by the end of that season, I couldn't stop thinking about it, highly praising and recommending it for quite a while. Then the subsequent seasons followed and the magic vanished pretty quickly, leaving a bitter taste in my mouth.

Season 1 gets a 10, It was the best and should have finished there.
Season 2 gets a 7.5, explored the aftermath, while having filler scenes of Hannah Baker, not doing justice to her in a decent way.


All executives involved, forgot about the real story of the series, about Hannah Baker and how she was martyrized and battered. They forgot about her pain, suffering and hopelessness, which got to my throat and saddened me beyond measure.

A continuation and dragging of a series mainly about Hannah Baker and her issues, without her being in it and an active part of it, was most unforgivable. I loved Liberty High and its life, but without Hannah in it, it was just a shadow of a life.

Hannah, you were traumatized beyond measure, made a point at the expense of your life and will be dearly missed. Hope that other persons like you, out there, find the courage and strength to speak up before it's too late."
"I was going through a massive depression, i thought i was the only one who was suffering, this show helped to get through my depression and made me stronger. Thank You 13RW. I love you Justin."
"Disappointed is all I'll say. People may disagree but this is honestly how I feel about the show.

Season 1 was 9/10 for me. Brilliant season. The shock factor made this show stand out. It felt like a refreshing presentation of not very commonly talked about situations. I do advice a little discretion if you're going through a tough time as it can have negative effects inadvertly. The show should have ended right here, and no one would've complained.

Season 2 is a drag. A very huge dip. It still ties to the main story but draws a lot of different branches, each of which explore the main plot from Season 1. Still watchable.

Little ""extra"" details ahead: Season 3 is a disaster in my honest opinion and hence you see the earlier 9/10 become a 3/10. I don't want to spoil anything exactly, hence I can't give away precise details. The third season doesn't even feel like 13 Reasons Why. It is so overly obsessed with ""who does what"" and ""who is it"" over 12 episodes while contributing contents of character development which doesn't even get utilized in the 13th (finale) episode. There's a new randomly introduced character and that character is supposedly someone the viewer should care for, for some odd reason. They tried character development to impact the viewer's perspective, but I feel like the execution was poor.

Season 4, here we go. Not as big a disaster as Season 3. I've seen people hate it and I totally understand why. The season is weirdly paced. Sometimes it feels dragged, sometimes it feels forced. There's too much unnecessary information again. What started off with the first season has zero relevance to this season, at this point. That being said, I think it's good to see them wrap it up. It could've been worse. Coming out of season 3, I didn't know what to think. But it is not as worse as I imagined it to be. It's still below average in my opinion, but at least they concluded the story without making an even bigger mockery of it. The emotional touch at the end did influence my opinion on the season.

9/10 for the first season. 6/10 for the second season. 2/10 for the third season. 3/10 for the fourth season.

5/10 for the whole 4 seasons.

Dylan (who played Clay) was great throughout the series. Katherine Langford did a really good job with potraying Hannah. Tyler, Justin and Bryce were well acted out too.

The show had a very limited shelf life. The show should've ended with Hannah's story. I think the creators should've acknowledged this simple fact. The story fell apart as the timeline progressed, even though the acting was top notch. It's a shame. Regardless, the first season of the show will always stand out to me. It will always be one of my favourite seasons of any show. Anything after that? I'd probably avoid."
"I can't explain how extraordinary season 1 was... But season 2,3,4 wasn't really good compared to season 1. 13 reasons why would be my favorite TV series of all time but season 2,3,4 successfully destroyed the show."
"Season one was great. If you've heard good things about this show, it's more than likely things being said about the first season. The second season is okay but not as good, and then the last two are pretty bad. They're entertaining don't get me wrong-but in some of the worst ways possible. In my opinion, it turned into a show where they were exploiting serious issues just for shock value and to keep the show running-as opposed to addressing those issues and tackling them with a storyline that makes coherent sense."
Dylan Minnette absolutely shines in these series and most of the cast delivers a solid performance. While each season differs from one another it tells a compelling story on how actions of a few can impact the lives of many. The variety of character is well executed by Brian Grazer who adopted the book this is based on to the television screen and gives fresh variety of issues teenagers might be dealing with in their every day lives. The final season is on par with the first season but falls a little bit short during the middle with bizarre scenes and out-of-context scenes that have little or no impact to the general storyline. The final episode is absolutely heartbreaking and I advice watchers to have tissue ready. One of my all time favorite TV series in a long time. Enjoy.
"The first thing I want to say before I start, is that I do not binge watch TV series. It's extremely rare for me, and I often don't even finish the season. This TV series had me hooked from start to finish and I spent all day watching it.

While I was watching I was thinking - this is absolutely brilliant TV. However, by then end of it, I was thinking - that was so powerful and emotional to watch. I could barely watch the final few episodes, because I was so engrossed in the story and it does becomes quite graphic. I will say no more.

Easily the best TV series I have watched in many many years, and an absolute must watch show."
"I came here to write a review specifically about the character Ani, but upon seeing previous reviews, there's nothing left to be said. The show apparently needed a voice in the background because Hannah isn't there to do it, so they introduce us to a RANDOM character and make us believe she was included in this very VERY closed off group because...that's exactly how high school works, right? Love the actress, hated the character. This show turned teen detective very quickly, and the main story line is everyone is lying about something, but what clue can us teen detectives find at the end of each episode to bring truth to a lie. Every time.

I DO have to say something about the cinematography and lighting and editing. That was awesome and these poor teams hardly get credit. The seamless transitions to flashbacks worked like, for the lack of a better term, like magic. You watch a character walk away, but in the same shot as the lighting changes see the character emerge again in the flashback. Standing ovation for that. I loved it."
"How strange it is for me to say this, but I hope they don't make a second season for this show. It ended exceptionally well, with beautiful one-liners and a soundtrack that was thematically symmetrical to the harsh reality presented in the show. The lighting, the flashbacks, the narration was pitch perfect. I love how the producers kept true to the book, developing the story peripherally as I expect they had to do, to make thirteen hour-long episodes, but they left the main plot untouched and untarnished.

Everyone who has been through high school knows that it isn't easy. Everyone who has contemplated taking their own lives knows isolation, knows a million streams of thought blazing by, knows about grasping at signs and the slimmest of hopes. The story presented here is so unapologetic and raw, so real that the viewer is left reeling from their own moral compasses flickering. Are we so innocent? It takes less than a moment to reach the conclusion that no one is innocent.

The acting is superb and convincing. The actors and actresses ages are finally reflected honestly in a young adult / coming of age show. I think everyone knows someone who has gone through some of the problems presented in the show which makes it so relatable. And although it doesn't give us any solid resolve to these challenges, just as in life, we go on."
"I have seen 2 episodes of S3 and I cannot stand Ani...It took 2 seasons to understand all the characters and they are giving more screentime to the new chick, it doesn't work that way."
"I watched the last episode and finished the series. My current mood is depressive and my feathers thorns. It was really impressive. The drama brings great sorrows to the audience, bringing sadness. It completely changes the way people think about their behavior towards the environment. We have behaviors that cause negative effects that we do not care about people we interact with, and that is to realize that our behavior can be one of the giant pieces of fist that are thrown into the life of that person. The worst do not care about it. So I always thought it was important to pay attention not to break your heart in this life. It is very important to act like human beings. This series is for everyone to watch. Especially parents. The biggest impact of the series was that I could start looking at the people around me with less prejudice. It is strongly recommended. 8/10"
"I have never written a review on here before, but use it religiously when watching something new. For people like me I felt like I needed to write a review about season 3. I am only giving it a four because season one and two were actually good. But season 3 is so disappointing, and makes my rating that low. This new character Ani is horrible! Everything about her is annoying, her voice, her personality, her lies, EVERYTHING. She came out of left field, doesn't even fit with the original characters. She has absolutely nothing to do with Hannah, which was the original point of this show. It's just very disappointing and she should of never been brought into the group."
"Season 1- The storyline of this show was great . The main character and story was dark . I really liked how they build up the whole story for The punisher. There were some good action scenes. But Jon really nailed his role. This guy really made this show more fun while being The punisher. Ending was great too. 9/10.

Season 2 - This season came with some new surprises and some interesting twists. There were some good action scenes and then there was a great ending. But it feels so bad that a show like this got cancelled. It deserves a chance to get renewed . Jon really need to get back as Punisher coz this is absolutely fire. 9/10."
"I really liked this show. I am not a comic book fan, but somehow found myself sucked in to Daredevil. It sux hard that Netflix cancelled all their Marvil shows.

Anyway, the Punisher was a great character on Daredevil, and despite some bad reviews, we gave the show a chance. We were really surprised how much we liked it. My husband likes it much more than Daredevil. It isn't as much of a comic book show as the other.

Despite lower reviews for season 2, I really liked both seasons. With so much crap on Netflix these days, it's hard for me to understand why they didn't fight harder to keep their Marvel Shows. I've heard Disney will reboot Daredevil for their streaming channel or for Hulu. But what's the point of remaking it with new actors when we love the show already? I doubt Punisher will have any chance for reboot or continuation. Very disappointing!"
"As a huge fan of Marvel I'm a little biased because I pretty much like everything they put out. My bias aside, The Punisher is terrific! It's actually my favorite Marvel show (along with Daredevil). If you don't believe me just read through the reviews here and look at the ratings. Even the critics loved this. Jon Bernthal was born to play The Punisher. He's easily the best part of the show. He's one of the most underrated actors working today. Everything he's in is great! This is a show that you'll want to binge as quickly as you can, it's that good. It's too bad that Netflix couldn't renew their contracts with Marvel and they had to stop making the Netflix Marvel shows because every single one of them was great! Now that they're on Disney they can bring these wonderful characters back. They already started to with Daredevil and Kingpin and just renewed Daredevil for another season. Now they have to do the same for The Punisher, Luke Cage and Jessica Jones. At least bring them back into the MCU somehow. If you're a Marvel fan then this is a must watch!"
"If there's one word to describe The Punisher it would have to be...awesome! It's one of the most gritty, violent thrillers I've ever seen! There have been a bunch of different versions of The Punisher over the years but Jon Bernthal is absolutely, without a doubt, the best ever and it's not close! He's such an underrated actor who's great in just about everything he's done. Hopefully, they'll bring him back to reprise the role in the future because no one will be able to top what he did with the role! I really can not recommend this show enough, so just go watch it!"
"Honestly, this show is pretty much perfect to me. My favorite marvel character executed surprisingly well by Jon Bernthal. I can't think of anyone else that would be better. Josh Stewart was also incredible; such an underrated actor and wonderful to see him in this. Please give us season 3, Netflix!"
"After the first season, with the release of the second season, I finished the series in a breath. I think this is the best project of the Marvel-Netflix partnership. It is a solid series that has been achieved after the cancellation of many Marvel-Netflix joint projects.

Action and blood enthusiasts will love this series. There's a lot more blood, death and action than the first season. In the second season has as much violence, blood, action and cruelty as you don't want. At this point, one of the other thanks must go to the kerography team. As you will certainly notice, we are watching episodes filled with fight and conflict scenes. The tempo is not interrupted for a moment, and each episode tries to place at least one action sequence. The Punisher's 2nd season just put Frank Castle in the chaos he deserves, and he succeeded in bringing all the minuses into a negligible situation.

The season has two main villains and both are as wild as the Punisher. The fiction is also established accordingly, and our two main villains are advancing in parallel. Curtis is one of the good characters of the season. He represented the conscience side of the series very firmly. Amy is another prominent character of the season. She's under Frank's protection because she's close age to Frank's dead daughter. It's fun to see Amy with Frank. Amy is a well-designed character. Her adolescent behavior, her indiscretion, and Frank's reaction to all these things are very natural. With Jon Bernthal's great acting, we have access to the emotions of a father hidden behind a bloody face.

The music uses were probably the best among the Marvel-Netflix co-productions. Too much music has been used and each one is very successful in passing the emotions of the scenario. Like Daredevil's corridor scenes, it's like we're going to look again at the Punisher's list of songs. And of course it is necessary to mention the last episode. It was one of the finest series finals for me. After many striking and emotional moments, it is impossible not to experience emotional explosion with the last scene. The Punisher role is seated on Jon Bernthal like a shirt.

We have watched an immaculate season with strong scenes of conflict, good acting, immersive fiction and fluent scenario that never falls behind its first season and even better for some of us than the first season. I hope it will be a long-term series and we will continue to watch Frank Castle. 10/10"
"This show was unjustly cancelled due to drama with Netflix and Disney+. You should watch Daredevil first because The Punisher TV series was a spin-off from Season 2 of Daredevil, Frank Castle stole the show. It's still worth watching."
"It took me a while to watch the second season but I though this show was just insanely good. The violence was perfect and the fight scenes were just awesome. Netflix has a lot of trash shows but this show was just brilliant. It had the perfect authenticity to what the Punisher is and it was told really well. Hell, I think this show is way better than Umbrella Academy, but that's just me. Sadly, you could tell it was going to end at season 2 just by seeing how Jigsaw was handled at the end...what a waste. It had so much more potential and only 2 seasons...stupid Netflix.

The actors in this show are all incredible and you fall in love with all the characters. You really get to know their personas and how each character has an influence on each other. The writers, actors and everyone involved in its creation made a show that I will always remember. Jon brought the Punisher to life and I don't think there will ever be a better Punisher than him, he really owned that character. To me, he's what Ryan is to Deadpool. If there ever is a Movie, Jon just has to be the Punisher or it won't be the Punisher."
I just didn't like season 2. Elements of it were good but the pacing was awful just like most of these MCU titles. They stretch a single story arc over 13 episodes and that just doesn't work. This season reminded me exactly of DD3 in that there was endless time spent on characters discussing whether they should kill someone that's a killer and evil. Feels so Disney. But more importantly it. Just. Drags. On. And. On. Btw daredevil and punisher were my 2 favorite comics as a kid. I look back and feel not much really happened. Very disappointing
The Punisher has been on my list to watch for a while and finally got round to it. And what a show it is. It starts off a little slow in season 1 but when it gets into its stride it certainly gets into its stride. Jon Bernthal is truly amazing as the Punisher - such a great actor I think. There's also a great supporting cast. It's very violent in places but I don't mind that and the action scenes are great. But it's not all action as there's a good storyline for both seasons and good character development. Let's just hope they make a third season now it's on Disney+
"THE PUNISHER is the best of the Marvel/Netflix TV shows alongside DAREDEVIL. In fact I think it has a slight edge over the latter; the characters feel more human and the action has that extra touch of intensity about it. The first season has a strong first episode but then becomes a slow burner until the second half, while the second kicks off with a bang and manages to carry on the momentum throughout. Great, violent action bolstered by solid plotting and an excellent turn from Bernthal."
"Finally Punisher done right! After so many fails from other film companies Netflix decides to go all out and almost perfect it. They almost pull him right out of the comic which could not have been easy, from the deep yells as he unloads his guns on the bad guys to the twitch of a man who is now disturbed but slightly keeping it together to the tie in of the Punishers mane nemesis. This show is the best Netflix Marvel show hands down. All of the main characters are great!"
"Casting is off the charts in this series, Jon Bernthal carries this show, bullet wounds and all. The first season was amazing, the second lacked the storyline development and fell a bit flat. It's hard to care though when the action is so amped."
It was the berst audovisual work about The Punisher. I felt like I was reading the comics. Great history and direction.
"Whilst I really loved the new Netflix series MANIAC

the punnisher starts off slow Then builds to become a powerhouse of glorious revenge The acting is superb Gore is great. Better than both movies that were released previously

Waiting for HELLBOY series if it ever arrives"
"I loved this series after I finished the first season. Bernthal is intense on the level of a young Deniro, perfect for the role. The writing was solid with a plausible and interesting plot, good acting all around and a nice mix of conflict within a guy who ultimately wants to do good. The second series really was a step down in writing. The ludicrous character decisions and motivations became too much for me to stomach even in the context of a comic book story. The character ""Amy"" was added - I guess - for some levity, but I found her hyper-millennial act extremely annoying. On top of that, the actress looks like a woman in her mid-20s, but they treat the character as if she's 16 or so...which is odd. I did enjoy the character of John Pilgrim, which was performed wonderfully by Josh Stewart. Really, the acting is what saved the 2nd season for me as it's mostly very good. As for the story, it's definitely full of action and gunplay. As most action-based modern series, this season of the show ramps up the sadism and brutality to cover for weak plot lines. I felt it kind of limped into the ending. I will be surprised if this one makes it another season. (At least on Netflix) If it does resurface, I hope it retains Bernthal... who has played this role far above any of the many others to attempt it. I also hope they invest in better writers."
"You have all the usual and annoying cliches: * Don't let the audience know what the hell is going on. If they knew the plot straight away, they'd figure out too early how awful it was. * Killing men is just fine. * Killing women is wrong, even if they have killed others and are trying to kill you. * Always avoid killing some of the worst people, even if you have slaughtered droves of others for far smaller reasons. * Insist on helping the most annoying girl ever, for no reason whatsoever. * Don't call the police, even when it is the obvious thing to do. * If someone saves your life multiple times, be sure to lie to them, try to ditch them, and try to screw them over with the police. Because this isn't annoying to sane viewers, no not at all. * Take your viewers for granted."
"This carnation of the Punisher is like a delux gourmet hamburger made with second rate meat. The original screen versions of built around second string heavies like Ray Stevenson and Thomas Jain adequately conveyed the comic book world of the source, where a declared dead law man gets revenge on mobsters who killed his family and left him for dead. Then in the pursuit of the real culprits, the Punisher wastes 50 odd other hoods. Basically, it was simple minded violent revenge porn and didn't pretend to be more. It was just comic book pablum for adult aged children.

Then Netflix comes around and tries to do an upgrade to the comic book schlock franchise, with the approval of the Lords of Marvel. Now the Punisher is an ex-special forces killer and the evil doers who kill his family are part of a nefarious multi-agency government cabal involving the military, FBI, NSA etc. The show also delves into modern surveillance techniques. Jon Berenthal does a great job of playing the PTSD wracked hunted vet. He is the best part of the show but it's all downhill from there. In the first episode, we were introduced to a female version of Steve McQueen's Bullit right down to the 67 Mustang Fastback, She is also an Iranian American Moslem too. In her first scene she meets her baddy old white guy boss who said she was a virtual checklist of affirmative action boxes. She of course bristled at this ""racist"" but totally true remark, she was indeed an affirmative action diversity's sake character that doesn't exist in reality. They could have made her an ex-Moslem or a Christian Iranian, like many of the 1979 refugees. But that would nix all the scenes they want to do about white guys getting all Izlamofauxbic. She is partnered to some nebbish Jewish agent who is one step up from a stock Woody Allen character. He could have been used for comic relief but we are supposed to take him seriously too. Then Frank belongs to a PTSD group of ex soldiers. Naturally, the blacks are all sterling characters who wouldn't melt butter in their mouths; while the white ones are lame liberal cliches of what a Trumpster might be..

Even the first round of baddies are lame. They are bullies from the construction job where our tormented hero smashes concrete walls to bits with a sledge hammer. They try to rip off a mob card game at night but the fool of the group revealed his identity to the mobsters by dropping his wallet open to his driver license in front of the goons. So the other pathetic thief construction workers decide to do the fool in in order to protect themselves. Frank quickly does those jerks in with a sledge hammer then goes to do in the mobsters at their lair. Finally he gives all the loot from the game to the fool would be thief and tells him to leave the City. But he is detected by the mysterious nerd hacker warrior rival-partner Lieberman, who is at least interesting. The show has all sorts of relevant messages for the hipster audience concerning gun control, racism and other pablum. At least the earlier versions of the Punisher spared us the preaching."
"Great action and strong acting. The stories between the 2 seasons were compelling and its a shame we wont get to see what the future would hold for it, but what was made was very enjoyable."
The Punisher is a fantastic series and the stories are well written and structured. That in addition to good performances and great action moments make this a must watch for any Marvel fan.
"The Gifted is a series that I won't be harsh on, as it was entertaining, had much potential and an overall good cast, but didn't live up to expectations in the end.

Pros
Near award-winning VFX and special effects, besides the horrible lenses
Overall good cast, especially worth noting are the acting of Coby Bell, Jamie Chung, Emma Dumont and Grace Byers
Entertaining storyline, well-woven at times (nothing deep though). The background of characters were well explored at the beginning of each episode.


Cons


To the series credit, it was a fun ride, was getting better and finding itself more after 2 seasons, before being abruptly cancelled by Fox, which has a strong and infamous history of creating good 1-2-seasons series before trampling them over, all because of what - the ratings point?!"
"Very good effort! Why not season 3? What!? Can't believe it! Disney, wake up!"
"The X-Men are gone. The world has grown to fear and loath the mutants especially after an incident four years earlier. Reed Strucker (Stephen Moyer) has been prosecuting mutant terrorists and for the last 5 years, he's been a member of the Mutant Task Force. His son Andy gets bullied at school and his mutant powers are unleashed. He and sister Lauren are revealed. Reed is forced to go on the run with his family. Reed tracks down the Mutant Underground where he offers imprisoned Lorna Dane in return for transit to Mexico. Jace Turner is a Sentinel Services agent driven to catch fugitive mutants due to a personal loss.

This is as good as network live action X-Men TV show is probably going to get. It gets to the main theme of persecution of minorities. It's not prestige TV. It doesn't have the dark style or experimentation. It has action with some limits. There is a bit of network blandness that bleeds into the show. It has a lot of lead characters but is able to maintain focus on them. The brother can be annoying which happens with some rebellious youth. I would love more daring in the writing but this is fine for network TV. At least, it's not Inhumans."
"This is very reminiscent of Heroes and the first episode hasn't shown something we haven't seen before.

There are some token characters and basically if you've seen any of the trailers out there you've seen the first episode. The little sentinels look a little bit too much like the robots from the Matrix.

Acting is good, CGI is bearable but could do better.

Not sure where the plot is going.. is it just mutants vs the Sentinel program? Anyhow it's not a bad start but it's not great either. At this stage it's decent but it could go either way."
"Please Make SEASON 3....We all enjoyed, want ANSWERS and more of the season.

PLEASE FOX OR MARVEL OR DISNEY.....WE ALL WANT SEASON 3"
"I really enjoy this series, good plots, good acting/actors, lots of potential...and each episode has improved as writers and directors are finding their groove.

But, please - kids, (Strucker brother and sister) - please emancipate yourselves from your constantly whining, hovering, wimpy, classic helicopter parents that are in denial about your powers and holding you back from maturing! They (parents) are the only part of the show that I cringe at, every time they are in front of the camera."
"I'm hooked after seeing the first episode, it's a great installment in The X-Men Universe. I was wondering will sink like the first episode of Inhumans. But it didn't sink it sailed in my book, the effects are incredible, and the CGI is not over used.

I love characters played Amy Acker and Stephen Moyer, who play parents trying to protect there two teenage kids who have mutant powers, and are hunted. The series has other characters, but the family is the driving force of the show. It deals with people being badly judged just for being different, so much of that goes around in real life too. I hope the show will go on for a while, I wonder if any the actors from the X-Men movies will make an appearance here, I hope."
"I do not know how I should feel about this. I guess, I´ve seen worse und worst und this is not so bad. I decided to watch it on a hunch and I do not regret having done so, but there are some things going wrong here. The teenie storylines of Andy and Lauren, yeah, I get those, they are just teens, some things I just overlook, when it comes to them, but not the parents.

I´ve watched, what now, three episodes and I am not satisfied with what I am watching. The father is just not credible, 20 years a prosecutor and he changes to a totally-ok-with-this gullible fugitive over night, just because he loves his family, so a change like that should just be- -what? obvious? It is not, not after 20 years of ruthless prosecution! And the mother? I don´t know who wrote her, but her actions and reactions are often horrifically moronic and annoying. Whoever wrote her part, did not do the show a favor.

Other than that, the acting is mostly decent and the mutant abilities and cgi do not overwhelm. It is interesting to see the mutants generally interact, not just in action scenes, I do like that, even though some lines are cheesy. Someone who has been hunted and discriminated all his life, will not just say ""yeah, I´ve done some stupid things out of love too"" after yet another incredibly moronic move Caitlin pulled in the third episode jeopardizing the whole underground hq. A grown up woman sleeps with a kitchen knife on a sofa but is still in doubt when she has to haul @ss and get the f... away from her brother´s house? Instead she decides to stay over the night and still has not made up her mind to just get her kids and run when two leaders of the underground operation show up telling her ""if we can find you, so can others""?

Who wrote this episode? Can someone tell me who wrote this plainly horrifically moronic character? He should be sued because he is ruining every shred of credibility the show has. Dramatic build-up and inner conflicts and loyalties and taking risks because of them, yes that I get, but not when it goes overboard on blatant stupidity. I would have given the show more than six stars, but moron Caitlin just ruins it sometimes and that is poison for an action / sci fi / fantasy series."
"Eventually, ""The Gifted"" won me over. Whilst it's clearly never anywhere near the top tier of the current TV options available, by the end of the series the show interwove itself more with the wider X-Men film and TV series enough that I was interested enough to not only keep watching, but make the decision that I am interested in a second series.

The show focuses on the Strucker family, led by a reliable pair of genre hands Stephen Moyer and Amy Acker, who upon realising that their children Lauren (Natalie Alyn Lind) and Andy (Percy Hynes White) are mutants, attempt to make contact with the Mutant Underground. The organisation have been put in place by the currently missing X-Men to try and keep them innocent mutants safe from Sentinel services and their shady work with Trask Industries.

AS you can see from that synopsis, there are apparent links to the movie universe in the series (though no major characters from them appear in the series). Without looking to give too much away, the Hellfire Club also begins to feature as the series progresses. These links continue behind the camera, with Lauren Shuler Donner, Simon Kinberg, Len Wiseman and Bryan Singer producing in various capacities, with the later three directing episodes too. Together they make a decent looking show whose effects, both practical and CGI are good throughout.

Less successful are the characters and performances that make up the principle cast. Almost all are familiar tropes, angsty teens, heroic mutants, loners who won't join the team, unprincipled scientists out for the greater good. The only touch of variance to any of this comes from Coby Bell's Sentinel Services agent who runs the gambit (pun intended) of a man conflicted by personal loss and a belief in doing what's right. It is pretty slow too, though this picks up as the series goes on. It could do with taking a further step away from weekly stories towards a bigger season arc with a deeper story. The potential second season arc could be that story, if they progress from how the first ends.

I don't think it is as good as any of the DC/CW ouput... or Netflix's Marvel shows, but it's a reasonably serviceable few hours of Network television with a couple of ideas that could elevate it if the production team choose to progress them. (Or Disney might buy Fox and cancel it all so they can make their own X-Men shows)."
"I'm usually hesitant to watch new TV shows these days as they mostly disappoint me. I am very critical on quality of acting and the plot or the story itself. I'm hooked alright!. Although it is more like the X-men series, it's surprisingly captivating. It emphasized the importance of family and value of human lives. The acting is excellent; the plot is unpredictable. The CGI can be improved, but it's far better than standard TV shows. It's an action show but not too violent. It's a great show to watch for the entire family."
"This is one of the better mutant TV shows I've seen, but I don't think that's saying much. The representation of powers and hype behind these mini x-men is interesting to watch to say the least. But the writing is whats really throwing it into the ground. Everything must be politically correct and every problem must be a close call that has some family learned lesson involved.

Every episode up to this point is just showing the kids get stronger while the parents say the same thing every episode about how this is a parents worst nightmare. The episodes will and can feel like they're on repeat from how the episode unfolds. I honestly believe the Von Strucker parents are the weakest link in the show and it needs to be patched up quickly. But the writing of everyone in the show is not far behind. If you can get past the cheesy, one-lining, over sensitive, cliché writing Then this show is definitely passable. But everyone should know by now from how FOX is."
"I wasn't captivated by the show. I think it suffers of the same problems of other current super hero shows: the writing. Some lines of dialogue are unnecessary (If someone just had an obvious meltdown, there is not need to ask ""Are you ok?""). Something that I just don't get is people with super powers sunning away instead of using the powers. I also find particularly annoying is the Strukers, especially the parents, so dramatic and unnecessarily over protective, wanting to ""help"" but not by letting their kids use their powers. I find the mom particularly guilty of this in almost every scene that she is in (which again, is mainly the poor writing). This show has so much potencial, but so far is being wasted. Comic book based shows need to be written by comic book writers or at least by people familiar with the style. soap operish drama should stay in soap operas."
A guy who can interact with the computer and hack every network and computer at will sources out his services for scraps of cash to random bums of the street basically. Why doesnt he conjure up some money with his power and enjoy life? There are so so many such stupid mistakes. Then theres the dull story that doesnt really progress much and the ever annoying mother. Not sure if its the actress of the character (or both) but boy is she annoying ALL THE TIME. Everything is always wrong for her. In general Im baffled how these kind of shows make it to season two while shows that are leagues and leagues ahead dont. Its sad.
"The premise and the first couple of episodes of the show are quite engaging and show a lot of potential for the series. Especially some of the characters were interesting and I really wanted to know what would happen to them.

However, after a while the storylines get increasingly dull and don't really do the characters justice. I ended up forwarding a lot until the end of the show because I wanted to see what would happen to my favourite characters but that was really the only reason.

The actors of the main family truly did a great job at working with the script they got but they could have done so much more with some great scripts. Two actors who especially stood out were Stephen Moyer as Reed Strucker and Natalie Alyn Lind as Lauren Strucker. Blaire Redford also has time to shine in his role of John Proudstar / Thunderbird, but I would have loved to see a little bit more about him and his backstory."
"I'd never continue watching this show. The dialogues are SO FREAKING RIDICULOUS. So much forced drama and overreaction by the characters, its incredible. I dont know how this show is rated 7.5.

Its hardly watchable to be honest."
At the start the plot is slow but it gets awesome later in the series. It presents some cool mutant abilities which I haven't seen in any other show.The drama is on point!
"Very good. LOTS of marvel characters that work well within a television show as opposed to a big screen adaptation. Loved the cast (especially seeing Amy Acker in a tv show again,, oh how I loved Fred in Angel!!)(yes,, I know she's been in other series,, but I haven't watched most of them).

Just watch it already!"
"For all fans out there loving the Heroes series The Gifted will be a great follow up in the realm of X.

Amy Acker is an amazing actress and brings depth and focus to the story. The cast are carefully picked and the result is great. The Gifted series will give any watcher a great episode of the Marvel X world.

The X world are filled with Mutants and we normal humans don't really understand how to handle the situation. Some act in fear and some with rage. The Gifted deliver a great aspect of the issues between mutants and normal humans.

Watching The Gifted won't waste your time."
"There is a good Marvel story trying to get out of this family drama. It's just the family drama holding it back. There are just too many ""we need to talk about this son"" moments, and too many ""over-bearing when it makes no sense"" mom moments too. They really seem to have built a lot of the show on the premise of, ""what if a regular family had a couple mutant kids in a very anti-mutant world""?, and that part isn't all that interesting. The attempts at back-story for the other mutants is shallow and does little to strengthen the story. So where might you ask is that good Marvel story waiting to get out? There is a plot twist that kind of ties some characters found in Marvel comics to some main characters. Several of the mutants have pretty unique abilities, and some of minor plot lines have nothing to do with the boring family drama plot that drags every episode it touches down. It's been picked up for another season, so hopefully there's enough feedback to steer this show in the right direction. I'd be OK with several episodes digging into backstory more. Clearly I want less family drama and more mutant story lines. There are endless Marvel story lines to draw from, which is really the only thing separating this show from something like Heroes."
When it's really going it's perfect. It has its ups and downs though on occasion strays into mediocrity for a few episodes before coming back with a bang. Overall the character arcs are greats and even the filler episodes entertain enough to get by. Hoping we get to see the next story in season 3!
"My rating for this TV series is getting lower by the episode. Very good start from ep01, but getting bored now. It's boring fighting against human beings. Add evil mutants to the script to increase the tension. Just My 2 cents. Hope this series will get better, do not want to see it axed."
"After the first three episodes, it's clear the writers can't steer clear of toxic cliché and tired stereotypes. There's too much useless babbling -- ""where did you get this car, these eats are sticky"" is what the son is whining about when the family is desperately on the run. The mother is an adamant soccer mom who doesn't seem desperate at all: she's gonna get answers to her questions or nobody goes any further... oh darn, the police have arrived.

This show is okay for a time killer, but nothing profound or groundbreaking is happening."
"True Blood is an extremely entertaining supernatural thriller that has a little of everything. It has comedy, action, drama, love, sex, etc., etc. It really is a classic! It's the best of the vampire genre and has more shocking, intense and exciting moments in one season than most shows have in their entire run. It takes the vampire genre into a totally new and fresh direction. It's just a flat out fun show that will take you into it's world and keep you entertained throughout the entire series. It knows what kind of show it is and doesn't try to be anything it's not. Some seasons toward the end weren't quite as good but still worth watching and really entertaining!"
"I absolutely loved True Blood. If you like vampire and supernatural shows then this is a must watch. It's one of the better supernatural shows that's ever been made. I really can't overstate how good it is. Like any supernatural show that's on for more than a few seasons some of it is corny but still entertaining. The only negative I can say is the ending was awful. It seems like it's hard to end a good show, most end in disappointment and this is no different. Having said that, it still doesn't take away from it being a great show. I'm actually watching it for a second time through now and I'm still as entertained as when I first saw it. It's a must watch for any vampire/supernatural fan."
"Sookie Stackhouse (Anna Paquin) is a waitress at Sam Merlotte (Sam Trammell)'s bar and grill in Bon Temps, Louisiana. She is secretly a telepath. Two years before the start of the show, vampires reveal themselves to the world after a new blood substitute True Blood had been invented. Sookie falls in love with vampire Bill Compton (Stephen Moyer). Her best friend is Tara Thornton (Rutina Wesley). Some of her other friends over the years include the gay cook Lafayette Reynolds (Nelsan Ellis) and fellow waitress Arlene Fowler (Carrie Preston). Her parents are dead and her brother Jason (Ryan Kwanten) is a womanizing fool. Andy Bellefleur (Chris Bauer) is the town's sheriff. Eric Northman (Alexander Skarsgård) is the Sheriff of Area 5 for the Vampire Authority and the owner of a vampire bar called Fangtasia. His progeny and second-in-command is Pam De Beaufort (Kristin Bauer).

This started as one of the best vampire shows around and there are lots of them these days. It creates a terrific world of vampires and humans. It's sexy and even sexual. It has its campy side. It's gory but not scary. It's a lot of fun. Each season, the show adds in a new supernatural aspect. However, each reveal reaps a diminishing return. There is an overall decline in the show but it never gets too bad. By the last few seasons, it is mostly a matter of staying with the show for the characters. One falls in love with them. Nevertheless, it is still one of the better vampire shows."
"Set in modern times, vampires roam the earth and are humans mortal enemies. However, a substitute has been found for human blood, a substitute that vampires can consume with the same effect as human blood. This is True Blood. Now humans and vampires can coexist in harmony, and even form relationships. But there will always be rogue elements on both sides ready to exploit the uneasy truce.

Superb, for the first few seasons. Original, uncompromising and highly engaging. Great character depth, clever, intriguing plots, interesting relationships and good performances. For 5 seasons this was fantastic.

However, the producers didn't know when to quit. The writing was already starting to feel a bit jaded, with retreads of previous plots and characters and, especially, different life-forms being introduced just to give the illusion of originality. The final two seasons were mediocre, at best.

The final season, Season 7, was particularly bad. No originality and the writers and actors seemed to be just going through the motions. Watching became a chore, something I had to do so I could finish the series rather than watching because I enjoyed it. Season 7 may well be the worst final season in the history of TV, especially when compared with what came before."
"Dracula living in a trailer park instead of a castle. NOSFERATU out on the bayou. THE LOST BOYS hangin' out down by the Chattahoochie with a keg, instead of in an underground lair with a beachfront view. A great dinner of catfish, blackeyed peas and rice and cornbread, served up with a tall, warm, bubbly bottle of...BLOOD.

However you want to describe it, TRUE BLOOD is not only unlike any vampire story that's been done before, it's not like any series that's on right now. It's DARK SHADOWS-meets deep-fried Southern Gothic, and only Alan Ball, the creator of SIX FEET UNDER, would dare stick his neck out to bring it to you.

Based on the novels of Charlaine Harris, which I've never read, (but certainly will after this!), BLOOD takes place in the not-too-distant future. It's been two years since the world got a shock it never expected: vampires came ""out of the coffin"" as a race. We suspected they always lived - and fed - amongst us, but now it's official, and just as before with race relations and as it is now with GLBT people, the reaction across the board is the same - fear of change and fear of the unknown influences most people's feelings about it. And it doesn't seem to matter much that vamps now opt for finding nourishment from a bottled beverage made of synthetic plasma called - wait for it - ""TRU BLOOD"", rather than from the warm, breathing, two-legged receptacles called Everybody Else.

Sookie Stackhouse, however, has her own unique take on the whole deal. Sookie (X-MEN'S Anna Paquin) lives and works as a waitress in Bon Temps, LA, at a roadhouse restaurant called Merlotte's, the center of most of the series' action. She serves up pitchers of beer and sweet tea, and will give you a piece of her mind, once she has a piece of yours...though you'll wonder how she knew what you were thinking. Sookie is a telepath, and unfortunately for her, she can't turn off the constant flow of other peoples' streams of consciousness...most of which offers way too much information.

The only minds she can't read are vampire minds, something she discovers when she encounters Bon Temps' first vamp, the courtly and smoldering Bill Compton (Brit actor Stephen Moyer in a bravura performance). They are taken with each other on first sight - Sookie, who is not afraid of the unusual since she herself fits that category all too well, and Bill because he cannot figure her out - is she mortal, or something more?

Looking on this blossoming romance in various stages of curiosity, disgust or outright disapproval are Sookie's brother, Jason (Ryan Kwanten), a walking hormone on two legs whose IQ matches his boot size; headstrong, opinionated Tara (Rutina Wesley), Sookie's childhood BFF; Sam Merlotte himself (Sam Trammell), Sookie's boss, who's got it bad for her and wears his heart on his sleeve on and off the clock; Lafayette Reynolds (Nelsan Ellis), the boldly out, proud and randy cook who serves as Greek chorus, instigator and confidante to Merlotte's employees, but most especially to Sookie, and her 'Gran', Adele Stackhouse (the marvelous Lois Smith), who couldn't be happier that Sookie is romantically involved with somebody...even if he is undead.

Not a single opportunity is wasted here to explore every nuance of mixing the ordinary with the extraordinary, in a way that even a series as outstanding as BUFFY could only get close to. Passion burns, secrets abound, betrayal, murder and things even worse lurk around every corner. It's what you've hoped for but never gotten from every soap opera that couldn't show you what was REALLY going on...until now.

Best of all, TRUE BLOOD is like the best songs that come from Mississippi Delta blues. It has an irresistible melody and a driving beat that pulses with sex, muscular sensuality and undeniable heat, with an undertone of menace lurking just beneath, ready to explode without warning...and sometimes even without provocation.

As with 6FU, Ball and his crew are firing on all cylinders here in the first two episodes I've seen. I sure hope they can keep it going...With the early renewal for a second season, HBO sure seems to agree, and so do the fans. Especially this one."
"I just finished watching this amazing vampire series once again..I saw it when it 1st came out and hadnt watched it for a long time..I'd forgotton how it ended and alot of it was like watching for the first time again. This is some Very unique writing and not like any vampire,werewolf,witch show that you have ever seen before..It takes the very difficult path of mixing horror,gore,sexuality, intensity, drama,humor and satire all in one show and it does it extremely well! You feel a bond with each of the characters and there is a great deal of character development over the seasons, so much so that some of the characters become almost polar opposites of what they were when they were 1st introduced..Another fascinating twist is the Bizzare but also Wonderful change in the writing that occurs in the last season..its So Different that you wonder what the heck happenned! The whole tone of the show changes and yes this will disrupt Alot of viewers who expect a continuity of theme thru the show till its end....But....The change ,though radical, is also wonderful..I'd say there is Less humor, less satire, more Intensity, More seriousness in each actors acting which leads to a more dramatic feeling..The gore is still there but its Not as funny, its serious, its intense, and its heart breaking for so many of the characters and they all act it out so well.. Overall, that last season was like watching a Different show but it was Every bit as interesting and entertaining...Now thats something you Dont see very often! I love this show...Sexy,smart, dramatic, satirical and crazy funny at time, heartbreaking at others...What more could you ask of Any show in Any genre? The Final episode covers the full gamut of emotions and wraps things up in a beautiful ending that would bring a tear and a smile to anyone... highly recommended!"
"This adaptation to film does sincere Justice to the book series. It captures the essence of what the author wrote. It was a privilege to watch this entire series.

Recently i rewatched some episodes and I feel that it holds up today just as well as it did when the show first aired.

This is worth your time if you're considering a watch! The background and lore are all compelling as are the episode to episode stories.

I will say that I was not completely satisfied with the final episode but I also admire that series finales are hard to nail and I am sure others don't all feel the same as me about the final episode. Nonetheless, it's worth a watch!!"
I loved this show when it first came out. I stuck with it for a while. I didn't like it got pretty weird and dragged on towards the later seasons.
"OK, I just watched episode 1 of this new HBO series, created by Alan Ball (""American Beauty,"" ""Six Feet Under""), and there is simply no question in my mind that it's going to be one of the hottest things on TV.

The setting is backwoods Louisiana. Sookie Stackhouse (Anna Paquin, from ""The Piano"") is a waitress in a local eatery during the day and at the local bar at night. She's pretty normal, except that she can read minds. And the crowd at the eatery and at the bar are pretty normal, too, by backwoods Louisiana standards.

Except that the hook of this series is that vampires ""came out of the coffin"" on national TV a couple of years earlier. They now live openly in society, because the Japanese have invented a synthetic blood that is sold in convenience stores everywhere as ""True Blood."" The vampires themselves are considered kinda exotic, and there are ""fang bangers"" of both sexes who long to have sex with them.

One moves to town. Sookie saves his life. Sparks fly. The stage is set for a really fun, well-written series. There is not a clunker in the cast, or an off moment in the writing. One to look forward to."
An odd show. I had to make myself watch the first few episodes then I got into it and enjoyed it for several seasons watch the series in it's entirety and it is worth a binge tv watch for good entertainment
"I would give this show 10/10 but oh man is Sookie annoying from first episode to last. The main story or back story to most episodes is ""I'm Sookie who is in love with me this episode?""."
"I doubt that I have watched a series that has gone from what I would consider a very good show in the first 3 years. A rating of 75 to 82 out of 100 for the first three seasons. To 30 to 50 out of a 100 for the last 3 seasons. This last season is especially slow, meaningless and horrible.

What happened did they kill off the writers from the first 3 seasons or did the writers see that this series was dying the ""True Death"" and leave.

I actually do not care any longer about Sookie, Bill, Eric or the rest of the cast of characters especially Tara and her moronic mother.

And really could you stop the CRYING. Every scene one weak ass character after another breaks out in tears. If you had a drinking game where every audience member had to take a shot when someone broke out in tears you would find over half the audience dead from alcohol poisoning before the show ended.

Truly sad to see a show with such promise hang on way to long and end this way."
"I'm a huge true blood fan, I have been since it came out. Recently rewatched it after watching 6 feet under. It's an excellent show. Compelling and most importantly, fun and entertaining! We love it. Admittedly, it got kinda dumb there for a minute but that's okay!! Love it."
"There is no doubt in my mind that True Blood is developing it's die-hard cult fans even as I write this.

Director Alan Ball has successfully adapted the show from the southern vampire series penned by Charlaine Harris. The show incorporates the gritty, down-south, feel that permeates Harris's books. The imagery, whether in landscape or in outfits, is incredible and really gives the viewer a chance to feel the atmosphere of the story.

The music is unbeatable... The opening credits rolling by is enough to hook a person right there.

The acting by lead characters is great. Anna Paquin as Sookie Stackhouse is incredible. She's captured just the right tones of innocence, lively spark, and morals that personify Sookie. The only thing that might be noted is that her accent seems a little off, I can't say how specifically it just sounds wrong which is understandable as she's a Canadian.

Stephen Moyer as 'Vampire Bill' is great as well. I thought his accent was great, much more realistic than other characters who I had definite red flags pop up when I heard them speak. His screen presence is unbeatable and he fits the role of a vampire almost eerily well.

I'm looking for some better character development in Tara, Sookie's close friend, she seems to fit a stereotype a bit too well for my taste. Hopefully writers will mix things up for Tara a little, give her some great lines.

So acting is a 8 out of 10, Screenplay and Scenery get a definite 10 out of 10, and the score is 10 out of 10.

True Blood is the kind of show that comes along and while it has every opportunity to fall flat, sinking into the rut of so many other 'vampire TV shows', it rises above and makes its own cut into the genre."
"And to people giving this poor reviews based on the acting, realize this show is supposed to be excessively campy. It's called fantasy. You think actors of this calibur are actually bad at acting? Foolish mentality. The cheese factory is so cringey it's actually good."
"This show is one of my favorite tv shows ever. Ever. At first, I thought it was a campy, soft porn, unfunny spin of Charlaine Harris's novel series.... but boy, was I wrong! Once I kept watching, it got better and better, and eventually became my favorite shows. It's so damn good!"
"I've watched the entire show for 3 times and still with each time I am amazed of how crazy, funny, fun, well written, witty and good it is The acting was brilliant, specially Lafayette who was the most amazing Character of all. Also the scenes with Pam and Eric, epic 🤣 I'll never get sick of this show. Too bad it ended"
"Characters of this show was so brilliant that you got attached to every single one. Show theme is on vampire protege but it looks very raw and makes interesting to watch. Yeah lot of adult scenes and blood sequences are there but if you didn't add those scenes then the show won't look promising.

Sookie & Bill chemistry are just amazing to watch even the show will keep you thrill in each and every epsiode goes on. If you love blood splits vampire type of stories then this show will not disappoint you. Go for it....."
"so, i read everyone else's reviews. it seems that if you are a Buffy/Angel fan, then you will more than likely loathe this series. otherwise, there's a chance you will really dig it. that is, provided lots of sex, especially really creepy sex doesn't freak you out.

let's start with the credits. i haven't seen credits that i actually enjoyed watching since the end credits of se7en. yes, the credits are weird. and cool.

the acting, look, cast, and score are top notch. the first two episodes left me clearly conflicted. not to be confused with dear departed dexter (another killer series). i was drawn in, turned on. and for some reason really freaked out. all at the same time. excellent.

i just bought the first 3 books...and i'm nearly finished with the first. well done, creators of true blood! well done, chick that wrote the southern vampire series!"
"The only emotion this series evoked in me was my lust for Eric the Vampire - delightfully kinky feelings awakened watching him. Haha. Sookie and Tara are not good enough actresses - what could have been emotional scenes just weren't because they couldn't carry it.

That said. It costs no brain cells to watch and is entertaining since there are hundreds of stories going on and non really delved into deeply.

The anti-white comments I did find disturbing."
"This series is far from perfect, but it is still very good, very well written, adult, well developed and creative. It's a top 10 of my favorite fantasy series the second season the best yet, incredibly well developed, super creative, well directed and well acted. The first season is not as interesting, and as interesting as the first is a 7.5 Season 3 is still good but not as creative as season 2 everything starts to go downhill after season 4 with not so interesting characters and adding too many plots at the same time my only negative criticism is that they did not take better advantage of the characters of Godric and Sophie Anne they were multifaceted and very well built, they could have yielded better plots and parallel plots

Godric, Sophie Anne, Marrye Forrester are one of the best and most interesting characters in the entire series."
"Another interesting, entertaining, and slightly on the odd side series from HBO that should have more than enough sex and blood for those more discerning fans of our mythical long toothed friends, the vampires.

On the other hand, some may find it little more than an ""R"" rated soap opera with teeth.

I'm more forgiving. I liked the first episode, thought it had a fairly strong cast, and the story held my interest, even though some of the southern accents sounded a bit strange. Still, having a lead character who is wound a little too tight, there's a reason for that, is a fresh enough idea and Anna Paquin, as Sookie Stackhouse...you heard that right, is well cast.

I'm looking forward to the next episode. Maybe this new show will reach right out and bite you."
"Seriously though. Best show currently on television. At first, I thought it was another cartoon for adults only with poor drawings. But it's not. It's different. For one, the jokes are funnier and the sads are sadder. The first season starts out more of a plain funny show, but beware this show will break your heart if you stick with it. It is also a really clever show - I'm sure that I'm not smart enough to catch all the references but sometimes I get the jokes and that feels good. Also, this show may be one of the depictions of depression on TV and movies ever."
"One of the best and most emotional episodes ive ever seen in a tv show. This is a masterpiece, this is an experience."
"The story of a horse that changed my life. Yes Bojack Horseman is simply something more than an animation series about animals and humans living together, not that it is much bigger than that. At first, I strongly objected to the evaluation of the first episode of Bojack, which scored 7.1, man. What is that? I watched it four times and laughed the same amount each time. Anyway, let's start the review. The first season was hugely funny and intelligent, but nothing was measured by the rest of the seasons. The series starts from the second season and reaches its climax in the third and continues to evolve until the last episode that will leave you feeling a great emptiness around you after you finish this great show Bojack is one of my top 10 so I won't talk more than that. One of the few offers that deserves a high rating. My rating 9.8"
"Listen here, I am going to be the most straight up and ask myself these questions, and try to answer them: What is Bojack Horseman?

What does it mean?

What does it try to reflect?

Why does it feel so real?

I'll tell you in one word: because it is REAL. As real can get..

It's every miserable dark corner of everyone's life that all of us is just too upset or tiny to talk about. It is the real real, showing every ugly and every petty, showing that we are just a piece of dust in this universe which is billions of years older than us, that we are meaningless and mostly little nothings, but we all want to be worth something...

It is made as an animated 'cartoon' in which animals are like people, dumb jokes top even dumber jokes and it is goofy, but just to get the inner child out of you to keep you hooked, but if you are left believing that its just a goofy dumb show, then it is not for you and please leave it alone..it is life, human nature, a never ending art. And for you others, brothers, we are all Bojack Horseman's and you just need to let it go..try not to think about it. Live your life, be happy with stupid stuff, maybe find the love of your life.. just stay happy and loyal to the most importants. I love you:) And for the creators and masterminds behind the show, thank you so so much, you have my full attention, you answered a lot of questions that I could never find the answers for.. just thank you:)"
"I don't usually write reviews for shows, nor have I ever written about anything on IMDb before, but I felt as if I should after watching this show.

It's hard to put into words the way I felt about watching BoJack Horseman. Sure, it starts out as a comedy with seemingly no real plot. Sometimes it just seems stupid, yet still comes off as possibly a new, interesting yet also run-of-the-mill animated series, but it starts to develop into something more. Something that I think a lot of people may or may not fully see to the end of the first season because they decided the show wasn't for them. And that might still be true. But I can't help but feel some form of disappointment. Why? I don't really know. I guess I just foolishly want everyone to get something out of it.

I don't think anything, whether it's a book, a movie, a game, or even a show deserves a 10. But sometimes, for just a brief instant, you stop caring about how you want to quantify how much you like something and just want to express how much you enjoyed it. That to me is the only way I can really describe BoJack Horseman. I can't say it's good, or bad, or even average. It's just a show that wants to get its point across, whether it's original or not. And it does it in a way that's hard to look at critically.

And at the risk of sounding like I'm contradicting everything I've already tried to say, I almost don't want the show to have a new season. Not because I hate it or think it's ""too good"" to continue on, but because it already feels complete. I obviously don't feel bad that the series has already been renewed for a second season. And even if it happened to only be a two season series, I'd still be thrilled. It's just that in some way, I hope it doesn't change.

So even though most likely no one will be reading this review (which is actually more like a reflection of how I felt about the show rather than a genuine examination), I at least hope that more people will try watching it and get some enjoyment out of it. Even if it's only for one episode. Who knows? I might even look back at it and wonder what I was thinking, or why I wrote a frankly pointless review about it.

But that's alright. Because in the moment, it was something memorable."
"BoJack Horseman is what modern Family Guy wishes it could be and then some; it's a black-comedy-drama show that looks into the life of a washed up television actor who's struggling to find happiness in his life and ultimately remains unsuccessful in achieving that. Who'd have thought a cartoon about an anthropomorphic horse would end up being one of the deepest things currently on television? I'm genuinely surprised by what this show had to offer for me the first time I watched it. The first season's initial half is a little slow, but from then on BoJack transcends into a wacky comedy-drama that is one of the bravest shows to confront the issues of depression, anxiety, loneliness and nostalgia.

I love this show. I can hardly fault it for anything besides the initially-slow premiere episodes, which I still reckon are great entertainment in and of themselves. This is a show that rewards your patience and loyalty to it ten-fold.

Netflix's animation achievement gets 5/5 stars."
"Who would have thought that a show about an anthropomorphic horse set in Hollywood would be one of the most human shows ever made. That was what Raphael Bob-Waksberg managed with BoJack Horseman. It's a show that's hilarious and dramatic, satirical and tragic as we follow BoJack Horseman and his friends through the trials of life. The show could be nilhilistic and the characters could be prophetic about their own destinies *couch* Sarah-Lynn *couch.* BoJack Horseman offers up on the best portraits on issues like mental health and addiction and doesn't sugarcoat anything. This makes the show so relatable and lets it stand out."
"Netflix, in their continuing mission to provide premium content to their subscribers, has another hit on their hands with BoJack Horseman. I had some reservations before watching the first episode, because there hasn't been a great new animated series in several years now. But with such a great cast on board, I figured it was worth a try. So glad I did, because it ended up being the best original comedy I have seen in a while, animated or otherwise.

It does not take long at all to get wrapped up in the story of BoJack, a has-been actor known for his role as a single dad in a popular early '90s sitcom. Having not acted in the 18 years since the show was canceled, he agrees to pen a memoir in an effort to relaunch his career. When confronted with the reality of how he is perceived by others, BoJack becomes desperate for acceptance and redemption from both the public and his inner circle.

For the most part, people from normal walks of life are portrayed as humans, while the elite class like actors and their agents are portrayed as animals. It's a surprisingly effective method to humanize these characters to whom the common person does not easily relate. Will Arnett, Kristen Schaaf, Aaron Paul, and Amy Sedaris all give their characters a 3-dimensional quality that is difficult to achieve in a 2D platform like animation. It helps that it is wonderfully drawn, with many subtleties that reinforce each character's persona.

Instead of a loosely assembled pile of anecdotal stories with characters that are just given a reason to exist, all the events during each episode contribute to the progress of the plot over the course of the first season. With episodes picking up exactly where the last one left off, the show feels more like a 3-act mini series than a TV show. That said, there are plenty of crass jokes and innuendo that will satisfy viewers who are not vested in the overall story.

I am delighted that the series has been picked up for a second season and to see in what direction the story of BoJack and his inner circle takes us."
"One of the best things to ever come from Netflix, BoJack Horseman is excellent. The characters feel extremely real. They are flawed, but learn and grow as the show progresses. More people need to watch this showz"
"The thing with BoJack Horseman is that it takes a couple of episodes to find its stride and those first couple of episodes have caused many a person to stop watching. It's a shame, because it ends up being really great, with moments that are poignant and sad and really sort of grab you in a way you don't expect.

Every actor is terrific, the animation is good, it's just an all around great show. It's not quite quite Archer, but then what is, you know? I loved this and ended up watching the entire series in one sitting which is a shame because I have nothing to look forward to until / if they go for a second season."
"I gave it half of Season 1 and I'm done. There is nothing in these episodes. There are many better ways to spend my time than waiting for this series to become watchable. I thought I could put it in the background but plain music is better choice

Most TV shows get only one chance at captivating the audience, I'm not about to sit through whole seasons just to reach some decent development. In order to even care about the relationships and the ways this story would go I have to first care about the characters and I just don't. All they do is whine about consequences of their own actions, while living relatively comfortable lives. Every major character is selfish and self-absorbed and in so does bad things to those around them, boo hoo. Imagine a bunch of rich bored people who only see their first world problems and will walk over anyone and everyone, there's zero loyalty and all the self pity. But as talking walking animals. Which is an attribute they don't utilize, I don't even know why they're animals. Real life is full of pretentious jerks as it is, we really don't need them in fantasy media. And even if they end up as moral goodie goodies I just don't care, they've annoyed me too much at the very beginning to invest myself into their journey.

Humor is boring and predictable, funny 1 in 34 attempts, even by 2014 standards Art style is tragic There's just no reason to keep watching. No beloved characters, it's not pretty, it's not new it's not even funny."
"Like the incessant influx of superhero films currently pervading Hollywood, ""adult"" animation has become a genre that borders upon an overstayed welcome. As a result, my personal expectations for the Netflix original series ""BoJack Horseman"" were not particularly high, but I do like to keep an open mind. Much to my delight, the series provides humor, drama, well-written and connected story lines as well as solid character development. BoJack is simultaneously a disdainful but overall likable character performed wonderfully by Will Arnett. He is joined by a fabulous cast of characters / voice actors that instantly bring this show to the level of other modern animated successes such as Bob's Burgers. In fact, I could absolutely have pictured H. Jon Benjamin as BoJack, but he already seems to lend his voice talents to so many different areas. The series also provides a fairly original artistic presentation as the characters almost resemble a painted portrayal at times. The show is not only humorous, but also covers subjects such as unrequited love, self-loathing, substance abuse, betrayal, and other more serious concerns that really serve to draw the viewer into the series. Overall, ""BoJack Horseman"" is an incredibly impressive entry into the burgeoning repertoire of successful Netflix original programming and I hope to see this series continue for years to come."
"Okay, I know there are not much Bojack fans around here. I even tried recommending this show to a lot of my close friends. But they couldn't make it past few episodes. Well the answer to that is, even the actors mentioned during various interviews, that you gotta binge watch this show. I binged it like crazy and I was left with nothing but emotional hollowness all around me. Every ending of an episode led me to contemplate about life. And then there were episodes which made me go all teary eyed. All the people who loved this show is because deep down all of us are Bojack Horseman.. Someone please give this show a Golden GLobe!!"
"In a world populated by both people and anthropomorphic animals, Bojack Horseman (voiced by Arrested Development and SNL's Will Arnett) follows the life of the titular horse, a former sitcom star. Bojack isn't the best person and has a lot of emotional and mental issues. I loved this show and consider it one of the best adult animated programs of all time.

This dark comedy is an excellent analysis of human nature, mental health, and the question of redemption. Be prepared that Bojack really does some awful things, though the show wisely paces them out. Yet, the show also manages to make you feel for Bojack. To clarify, the show never validates his actions. In fact, there is self-criticism of the its own anti-hero genre. The writing, characterization, and use of continuity in this show is EXCELLENT.

Though the last paragraph makes this sound super dramatic, there's plenty of comedy and it's really, really funny. There is some really cutting satire of Hollywood and showbusiness. The show does a good job of balancing the darker aspects with lighter stuff. Bojack's goofy, carefree longtime house guest Todd (Breaking Bad's Aaron Paul) is a great balance with his wacky misadventures.

Also, this is that rare show that never drops a beat. All six seasons are quality, including the last one whose cancellation was sudden.

I can't recommend this enough. This show is pure genius."
"Now that the show is over, I need to shout a big thank you to the it and all the people that made it happen. Just, just that.

Thank you."
"When I began this series, I had absolutely no clue how incredible it would prove to be. I was a fan of adult cartoons before seeing BoJack, I initially expected it to be one of those shows with some funny moments and occasional good messages, however upon viewing, my mind was completely blown. It was first recommended to me by a friend and I saw a few episodes, I thought it was okay but not amazing, but later on the new season (at the time) came out and he recommended it to me again, I picked up where I left off and after a couple more episodes, I was entirely hooked. Never before had I seen such hard-hitting, heartbreaking, emotional topics handled so elegantly, whilst still consistently achieving hilarious humor. In my opinion, BoJack is the second best TV show ever to exist (the first being Breaking Bad) and I 100% stand by BoJack as being the best show on Netflix, way better than the pathetic excuses for shows like 'Paradise PD' and 'Big Mouth'. I recommend this show to the moon and back, but get the tissues at the ready."
"While the first season wasn't fully developed in it's characters and situations, I still enjoyed it very much, and had developed a bit of an emotional attachment during the last 3-4 episodes. But nothing could have ever prepared me for seasons 2 and 3, which offered some of the most poignant insights into celebrity culture and the nature of depression for a multitude of characters, which had by the time become grounded in their own right, I have EVER witnessed.

I can't even put my thoughts into words for this review because I love this show so much, which is very surprising, I try to stay as formal as possible. I won't spoil anything, but there was a few different episodes in the past 2 seasons that made me cry, scream, hate, love, everything. This is really one of the few animated shows I can think of that brings on pure, unaltered moments of absolute emotion from the deep dark places of my soul. I connected in ways I never would have thought possible to Bojack, as well as a few other characters in the show. This is a must watch for anybody and everybody, you just have to get past the first half of the first season to truly start to love it.

Oh, and the show is also outstandingly funny. Worthwhile as a comedy alone."
"I don't know why I took so long to watch this one, it had been recommended to me to plenty of times for the last few years. This became my favorite adult animated show. Rick and Morty is good with the subjects of nihilism and it has it's depiction of self destructive depression but it doesn't get it quite as right as BoJack Horseman. Every form of depression is presented in this show and they're presented in such an accurate way, I had tears in my eyes watching a talking horse go through similar situations I have been in. In some ways I relate to BoJack but I saw myself more in the characters of Diane and Princess Caroline. That's the beauty of this show, every character is relatable in some way but the way they've been written is so natural, it's not a forced depiction of the various damaged type of folks that exist in society.

The character development in this show is phenomenal. We see BoJack's ongoing struggle with depression, trying really hard to be a better person but falling back into his toxic patterns. Every season he digs himself into a deeper hole because he refuses to fix himself, because he believes he can't be fixed - this is present in the character of Diane as well but her forms of self sabotage are more subtle. Different forms of depression are shown from substance abuse to self delusion and they're all presented in the most accurate way. I love the episodes where we get into the heads of BoJack, Diane, and Princess Caroline. We see how BoJack has an ongoing battle in his head going from positives to absolute negatives, he tries to have self love but it immediately transitions to self hatred. Diane can't forget the hurt she faced in her early years, constantly hearing her father and school bullies talking her down. Princess Caroline helps herself feel better by imagining her grandchild talk about her successes in the future. The way these moments are shown, even the style of animation they choose to present these moments, it's just a brilliant work of art altogether.

The show definitely has its many moments of humor, this is a comedy after all. Todd and Mr. Peanutbutter provide the comic relief although they have their deep moments as well, but the show does an incredible job of showing you that although these characters may appear stupid, they're actually the happiest people in the entire series. Both of them have their tough moments but they both rise out of their problems better than the other characters because they're happy. I love that they have BoJack admit to Mr. Peanutbutter that the main reason he does not like to be around him is because he envies him for his happiness, that was such a powerful moment. I hadn't seen a moment that powerful in a film or series in so long and I didn't expect to see it in a show about a talking depressed has-been horse.

Honestly I can go on and on about how amazed I am with this show. I can even write an entire essay about how this show properly depicts mental illness. As someone who still battles with depression here and there, I felt completely understood with this show. Finally someone got it right and it was a show in a universe where talking animals cohabitate with humans. I will rewatch this many more times. It's a show that knew when it was time to end and connected every single story they told until the very end. The writing in this show, to all the writers out there that want to tell great stories on screen or even in a book, watch this show and take notes.

I love BoJack Horseman, thank you the team that brought this show to life. I'm not exaggerating when I say I'm an eternally grateful to know this show exists and understood my pain in a way I never thought any form of media could completely understand - in a way I had not felt since Amy Winehouse released Back to Black. Highly recommend this show, you will not regret it. It's a masterpiece."
"I started watching Bo Jack when I was 17 years old. I am now 23. This show grew in depth and maturity as I did. The way that it captures the darkness and ugliness of life, while also celebrating in its wild crazy unpredictability, is like nothing else. While I struggled with purpose, meaning, mental health, drugs and the rich expanse of life that is sometimes so difficult, I felt I could relate to Bo Jack Horseman. It is a very honest portrayal of many things. And a very, very, gloriously silly way to do it. I grew with these characters. There is something profound about this. This piece of art, that I know will never be done again. The attention and care and genius that is here, is worth celebrating. Thank you for Bo Jack Horseman"
"Wow. Bojack Horseman is an amazing show with fascinating episodes that are creative and unique for TV today. It deals with deep and complex characters and faces so many issues with a refreshing style. Some episodes are incredibly emotional and extremely immersive. However, I felt the earlier seasons were not as good as the later seasons - my personal favourite being season 4 as the main storyline dealt with a complicated, depressing issue in a breathtaking way. Bojack Horseman is not the funniest show, there are plenty of chuckles though. Overall this show was amazing with great writing and was something so different to everything else I have seen."
"...Ok, so apparently I'm the only person in the world whose not crazy off his rocker bonkers about this show, and I think a disgruntled mob with pitchforks might assemble on my front lawn to skewer me for saying so... but heres my take....First the pros: It has decent writing, and occasional* (emphasis on occasional) funny and insightful social and cultural bits of satire /commentary and top notch voice acting particularly from Will Arnett and Aaron Paul and it does have one of the best intros sequences I think of any animated show but ... The cons: it's still just essentially a half decent yet self indulgent empty depressive sitcom about a washed up entitled kind of dumb egocentric but self aware sitcom Actor and his struggle between validating a legacy and using it to compensate for his self doubt stemming from a broken childhood and filling the voids inbetween with more voids and everybody thinks it's so novel because it's pointlessly packaged as a cartoon, barely using the medium of animation to be visually creative other than pointlessly making random characters animals as generic one note personality jokes or puns that get boring after 2 minutes, they pidgeonhole (no pun intended) themselves into this then beat it to death for the rest of the show...there's an episode with a chicken where they pull literally every chicken pun possible out until by the end I felt like someone vindictively shoved a rubber chicken down my throat.....and I was coughing up feathers....and why the heck is bojack horseman a HORSE!!!! and they really blew an opportunity to create a clever buddy dynamic between Todd and Bojack, and they flirted with this idea in the beginning of the show but instead they turned Todd into a pointless dimwitted borderline mentally handicapped jester in a series of loosely related incoherent idiotic b story misadventures, hes totally undeveloped as a character, just a 2 dimensional cardboard cutout of a character with no depth or motivations explored, compared to Bojack, a fairly well fleshed out character...its a blown opportunity.....strip away the animation and it's just a inconsistent average hollywood sitcom spoof about behind the scenes hollywood and the fallout of a once iconic sitcom.... with all the worst elements of Hollywood elites* ...the whining about their problems ugh turned into a cynical satirical pity party of pretention...although they do lampoon themselves and celebrity culture to be fair, however it's just the fact that it takes place in that element to begin with that's ironically annoying to me..., I despise the vapid superficiality of celebrity obsession culture and it feels like the celebrity tabloids turned into a cartoon...I can see this being great material to those in the industry that can relate but for me, and Gob bless you if you like it, its a total chore to get through most episodes and is at the bottom of the barrel compared to all the other good animated shows imo, dont waste your time or be duped by the incoceivable hype...., the fact that everybody and their grandma rave about this show is beyond me, I am genuinely baffled, the return on investment in terms of quality does not warrant the watch imho... dont get me wrong, it has its moments and their are a handful of clever well paced episodes where it all comes together (particularly the last 3 episodes of season one) but that's only about 15% of the time...because after this it just sunk back into a lull again...not high enough numbers in a field of top notch competition, sorry, pass"
"Modern Family is one of the funniest sitcoms of the last decade. The entire cast is hilarious. It has one of the best ensemble casts of any show I can remember. Every single character shines and all the actors and actresses were perfectly cast for their roles. This went on for 11 amazing seasons, each one just as funny as the others. It never felt like the show was going stale or over staying it's welcome. Even watching the reruns will make you laugh like it's your first time seeing it. This show has won so many awards over the years and each one was earned. What makes this show so funny is that every family can relate to someone on the show, sometimes all of them. I would definitely recommend this show for anyone looking for a new sitcom."
"Modern Family is a documentary style sitcom that follows the lives of a family. There's a reason why this show and it's actors/actresses won so many awards over the years...because it's hilarious! The cast (Ed O'Neill, Ty Burrell, Sofia Vergara, Eric Stonestreet, Julie Bowen, Ariel Winter, Sarah Hyland, Jesse Tyler Ferguson, among others) is one of the best overall casts in sitcom history. There's really not a weak link among them, they're all pretty much equally funny! Of course everyone has their favorites and some are a little better than others but not by much. It's a testament to the writing and the actors that you're favorite character will probably change several times throughout the series."
"'Modern Family' more than deserves to be recongised as not only one of the best comedies of the 2000's, but also amongst the best ever.

Sharply written (by several 'Frasier' alum no less) and wonderfully performed by a fantastic cast, this show was near perfection for its first 7 years.

Like all good shows though it did decline in later years, while of course still being able to come up with exceptional episodes along the way, but the writers did seem to run out of logical new stories and ways of developing the kids when they grew up.

Overall though, this was a fantastic show, and one I will revisit regularly."
"Modern Family is my all time favorite comedy show, it's so comforting and entertaining to watch. I love all the characters and the hilarious and creative storyline. Definitely one of the best comfort shows."
"Modern Family is primarily a comedy that revolves around three families that are held together more by their virtue of acceptance and love than by the blood ties that connect them. Each character has been thoughtfully written out and played to perfection by a slew of actors who take your breath away. A family that is so imperfectly perfect that you draw the expectations for your own family - present or future - from their actions, morals, decisions and values.

It's a show where an old rich man marries a young woman of colour; where a white patriarchal figure accepts, not without his reservations, his openly gay son and his partner; where a gay couple gets its chance at parenting when they adopt an Asian girl; where we have a teenage pregnancy create the foundations of a loving family; where an old couple decides to give parenting a spin in the second innings of their life; where each child grows up emboldened with the confidence that his family is there to support him/her to become their own person.

What the show does impeccably well is throw societal expectations for a toss to underline only one thing - who we are and choose to be does not dictate the rightness or the wrongness of our being. The only this that does is the purity of our hearts. That is it. One episode after the other, we have the writers create interwoven and hilarious narratives into episodes that break stereotypes and societal conventions to showcase the meaningless of their existence.

Despite the seriousness of the central theme, the show is outright hilarious. It is witty - much too witty to understand every joke, every emotion, every retort in just one watch. The writing is spot on. It makes you live the characters and fall in love with each one of them - one episode at a time. It's made me pause the show because I had to laugh so bad. It has also made me pause to make way for a few tears which flowed without announcement, without purpose. The families, despite their eccentricities and unconventional way of being, are ever so relatable in how they love one another. The only way to truly love someone is to let them thrive in their own choices - that's what I learn from this show - every day.

It's unparalleled what this show has done for the people who were too scared to come out of their closets and the parents who were too scared to have a kid who did. I cannot recommend this show enough. You will feel a myriad of emotions when you truly embrace the depth of the stories and therein lies its beauty."
"The single most amazing thing about this series is that it never got tired or predictable, never got preachy, and has layers that can only be discovered if you watch it more than once. Okay, that is not a single thing. So sue me. But seriously, folks, the writing here is a study in mixing subtlety and the obvious. Every character is carefully developed and you will find yourself wondering which is actually your favorite after a few seasons. Even the guest stars shine, and the sprinkling of celebrities in later seasons must indicate that the show achieved a special status. It is probably not a surprise that Lloyd used to produce Frasier."
"The only reason I'm giving 9 and not 10 stars for this brilliant show, is because I do agree with many other reviewers who are saying that it was dragged out too long.

With shows as good as this one we often never want them to end, and neither did the cast and crew it seems after watching the farewell doco... but keeping it going for 11 seasons unfortunately does mean things start to get a bit repetitive and stale.

But in general, I think this show is one of the best comedy sitcoms I've seen in my 38 years. It's easy to watch, hilariously relatable and a nice break from all the extremely graphic blood, gore and sex and that is taking over our screens!

I love the themes of diversity and acceptance that were largely absent in the shows of my childhood, it's great to see these ideas becoming mainstream :)

All in all it's just a wonderful show, great writing, great cast. Loved it :)"
"For those still in withdrawal from the cancellation of Arrested Development, let me write you a prescription: Modern Family. The comparisons are obvious and with good reason. The postmodern comedy for the 21 century was ushered in by The Office(UK) and Arrested Development, but I, for one, doubted something could come along and satiate my longing for another truly, original comedy. Albeit, you may initially be wary to see yet another mockumentary-style show, but by the end of the pilot, you'll be smiling/laughing way too hard to stay cynical. Thus far, the plot lines have been really fresh and the characters are so, for lack of a better word, lovable. This show fulfills all my comedy needs, and I feel like I must resort to the listing of relevant adjectives: Witty, dry, smart, outlandish, silly, clever, cute, sarcastic, subtle, not-so subtle. HILARIOUS. I hate to say it, but the laugh tracks and raw goofyness of classic sitcoms like 'Seinfeld' and 'Friends' are obsolete and leave something to be desired. You will find that something in Modern Family. And who knows, maybe some of the more painfully funny and poignant scenarios will reveal insight into the changing dynamics of both the modern family and modern comedy. Great show. Period. And let's get it right this time around: don't cancel good TV shows. Pretty please?"
"Give this show a chance. I really kind of watched it against my will, but figured I'd give it a shot. I bet out of a hundred pilots, I would like maybe one - this was that one. I literally laughed out loud at numerous parts - the way that it comes together is interesting / well-done - each couple has an interesting balance - great dialog (IMDB won't let me spell it with a ""ue"" at the end) - original characters - I'm impressed.

I don't think I've ever seen ABC come out with something in this vein. Normally their shows are a bit watered down, but this is edgy and as fresh as anything I've seen hit network TV. I know that comparisons to Arrested Development will be frequent, but I think that this has more structure. The characters aren't as wacky, but they're more believable and easier to sympathize with in my eyes. Tremendous acting, great kid actors - I forwarded the pilot to a bunch of people already, and I feel lucky that I got to watch it before it came out officially."
"Modern Family is one of the best shows on TV in 2009.

It's written by smart and funny people. It shares some DNA with Arrested Development and Fraiser, but has a little bit more heart.

6 episodes in and I am still impressed and still laugh out loud.

I usually avoid ABC because their programming in years past has been terrible and vanilla. Happy to see they have taken some chances on this show and hooray for them, it seems to be finding an audience and critics love it too.

I usually hate shows with little kids in the cast... they usually end up getting used as cute crutches when writers run out of ideas, but Modern Family has been giving the kids sharp dialogue to match the grown ups.

The gay Mitchell and Cameron couple are portrayed honestly and they are hilarious.

The very underrated Ed O'Neill is pitch perfect as the grouchy but soft family patriarch. Sofía Vergara who plays his Colombian trophy wife is excellent and very funny in what could have been written as a terrible bimbo role.

I wasn't sold on Ty Burrell as the dad who tries too hard to be cool after the pilot... but he's a slow burn, and now it works.

Julie Bowen as the slightly off kilter mom adds an anchoring charm to the mix.

Every person on this show gets good lines, and the quality is holding up... I hope they win a boatload of Emmys."
"Up to Season 7 was great, a laugh a minute but season 8 & 9 just bomb I think I manage one laugh a show. They should rename it to Sarcasm Family it's just full of bickering and bad jokes."
"I just want to say that I love this show!! It is good family entertainment. I believe all of us can relate to someone in it or have a relative that can. For those of you who only saw the pilot (which I watched by accident and loved)please don't give up on it, it is really good comedy. I can't decide who my favorite character is, Cam, Phil...all of them, each week another one cracks me up. I rarely watch TV but this one has me hooked. I agree that the format is much like The Office, which I also think is funny, but the shots to the camera, the expressions are some of the best parts. We have all of the shows on dvr because my daughter and I usually can't wait till the next Wednesday to see it again! Again...Best show in years!"
"This show was great for the first 5 seasons, it was original, funny, smart.... then the kids grew up and the writing lost its humour. Season 6 was ok, but after that it just went downhill. It's such a shame they didn't end on a high note rather than drag it out, flogging the horse until it was well and truly dead. Part of the problem was the child actors who were adorable when little but lost their ability to act as they aged!"
"With everything's on the media right now, watching something like this does put some ease on my heart. I didn't knew I needed it until my sister made me watch it and i was hooked from the first episode and if not for few sick days i would've easily finished it earlier.

Obviously certain character development are I'm not so sure about but that's what the show is about: embracing flaws. And its such a treat to see all the child actors grow up to be the amazing person they are now.

HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.

Thanks for reading. See you later."
"Because I have not one, but two, DVRs I'm able to give all the new shows a chance, which I did with ""Modern Family"". Am I ever glad I did!! I have found that everything about this show is believable. Though the situations that occur during any given half-hour show would obviously never all happen in that short a stretch, I have no difficulty in believing that they would all happen. I never feel that anyone's exaggerating to draw a laugh or milking a laugh. It's just the only ""laugh out loud for the whole show"" on TV today. It is, IMHO, the funniest show since MASH, and that's saying some.

There are some parallels to another of my favorites, the little appreciated ""Arrested Development"", ""Modern Family"" has its own unique flavor; and the flavor is . . . hilarious!!!"
"When I saw summer promos of this sit com I thought it looked forced and very predictable. As Cam would exclaim, ""Surprise!"" It is well cast, written, and consistently laugh out loud funny. The documentary camera bit is actually as well done, no, even better than one of the best, The Office. I recognized most of the talented adult cast, they have great chemistry, and it was so hilarious when Shelley Long guest starred as the ex wife. But it is the kid actors on the show who are amazingly well directed in their parts- Manny, as a son, stepson, brother, uncle, and cousin is a hoot: he can wisecrack with the best of them, and then break your heart when dad isn't able to fulfill his promise for the weekend. I always thought Steve Levitan did agreat job with ""Just Shoot Me"", on NBC and I think he and ChristopherLloyd have got a hit show for ABC. Take a look at this so ABC won't cash in on some more ridiculous reality shows."
"I saw the trailer for this show a while back and was instantly intrigued. Shot in a ""mockumentary"" style it follows the lives of three couples who's various members are related as family members. Although the set-up is slightly cliché, a gay couple, a stereotypical family and a Columbian wife and son (from her first marriage) with her American husband, this is where the standard ends. The dialogue is fantastic and at many points I found myself really laughing quite loudly, something which is very rare for a TV show to accomplish for me personally. The casting is also spot on with the inclusion of Ed O'Neill (the infamous Al Bundy!), Ty Burrell, Julie Bowen and Sofía Vergara, with each actor really bringing something unique to the mix. I strongly recommend this show to anybody who appreciates good comedy, the ""to-camera"" sections of the dialogue have a very close resemblance to the original UK version of ""The Office"" and for those who are familiar with this, Modern Family will be a welcomed return. Great show, great acting, great script. Highly recommended."
"I decided to check out ""Modern Family"" after hearing all of the critical praise about it. The show was five episodes in, so I caught up on the action online. And I must say that the acclaim is well-deserved. The show is nothing like what I'd imagined when I read about it. It is not a typical three-camera sitcom and it actually IS as gut-wrenchingly funny as people say.

With any modern TV comedy, people are going to compare it with ""Arrested Development"", which is highly regarded as one of the greatest shows ever by many. ""Modern Family"" is not quite ""A.D."", but I can see why some people may compare the two.

""Modern Family"", like ""Arrested Development"", is a comedy about a wacky extended family that is filmed in a quasi-documentary style, similar to ""The Office"". The characters don't acknowledge the camera, but they do contribute ""talking head"" segments to supplement the action. The show is less cartoony and surreal than ""Arrested Development"" or ""30 Rock"", but the comedy can still get pretty off-the-wall.

The ensemble cast is great. There are three branches of a single family. The patriarch (Ed O'Neill) has re-married, bringing a Colombian-born wife and her son into the fold. The daughter (Julie Bowen) and her husband (Ty Burrell) have three kids. The son (Jesse Tyler Ferguson) and his partner (Eric Stonestreet) have just adopted a Vietnamese baby. The show focuses mainly on the parents and how they raise their families and interact with each other in today's society.

My favorite character is Phil (Burrell), who plays the dad who tries to be ""hip"". He means well, but he's really kind of a wimpy husband. Phil's always putting himself in awkward situations (without always realizing it) and some of his lines are hilarious. He tries so hard to be the ""cool dad"". Next I like Cameron (Stonestreet), who's gay and proud of it. He's sensible and sensitive and he has some great lines, too.

Although I haven't really connected with the show like I have with some others (just a matter of personal style), there's no denying that ""Modern Family"" is an above-average comedy. It's written well, with humor sewn throughout the fabric of each episode, and each episode packs some laugh-out-loud moments. And I say this as someone who rarely actually bursts into audible laughter. (Occasionally, with shows like ""A.D."" or ""30 Rock"".) This show does it, though. Phil, in particular, has me in stitches.

To give you a comparison, I'd say ""Modern Family"" is like a cross between ""The Office"" and ""Arrested Development"". Presented more like the former, with humor and content drifting more toward the latter. More grounded in reality than ""A.D."", though, and without some of the triple-entendres and zingers.

The show finds windows to sneak in some wholesome family morals like togetherness and acceptance, but the episodes always end with a laugh.

But the rumors are true. ""Modern Family"" IS a very funny new comedy. Check it out on ABC or ABC.com if you don't believe me. (Or wherever else it's available.) It definitely should be on your radar."
"I love this show! I agree with others that the first 5-6 seasons were better, but I still enjoyed it immensely...well, most of it. Claire's character is completely off-putting and unlikeable. Every now and then she might have a sweet or amusing moment, but mostly I just want to fast forward through every scene she's in.

Ed O'Neill is a treasure and I love his interplay with the rest of the cast. Great writing (though admittedly less successful the last couple seasons), wonderful job by the actors. Lots of great guest stars as well. I never got around to watching this show when the first few seasons were on the air so I'm glad Hulu has it available."
"Scripted shows that employ a documentary format often use the P.O.V. talking-head shot as a gimmick to put more visual variety into the show, and to create a style of story-telling that they hope will keep your attention without having to improve the plot or characterizations. You can tell because they often go back to the interview at the most weakly-written moments. This is one problem, but not the major one, with Modern Family. The aspects that disturb me the most are these: they're supposed to be modern families and there are no working mothers (do the writers misunderstand the term ""post-feminist era""?) except for a few temporary jobs in single eps. Also there are no poor or even lower-middle-class characters. Actually, I do remember one character who was poor, but of course he was a one-time character on a Christmas episode. I'm sick of the characters whining about first-world problems like not being able to buy the ""perfect gift"" for their spouse on their birthday. What's so tragic about buying the iPad the day before or after their birthday? I realize this is a satire, but the writers don't seem to have that much contempt for the people they're satirizing. They don't seem to be TRYING to show how spoiled and self-centered many upper-middle-class are (it just comes out that way). That's not part of the satire, except maybe with the character of Haley (Sarah Hyland). Another thing that bothers me is that Claire (Julie Bowen) comes off as a lot crazier than the writers seem to intend. She's ALWAYS breathlessly freaking out, and it's more irritating than funny. In real life she's be at least an OUTpatient in some psychiatric facility. The gay couple (Eric Stonestreet and Jesse Tyler Ferguson) are gay stereotypes, especially Cameron, but since I hate political correctness and they're actually funny it doesn't bother me much. It would be nice, however, if the show did what it could to improve America's perception of gay people. Since Camoron is a prissy, whining, crying drama queen, the other character, Mitchell, could be the antithesis of a gay stereotype. The comedy could come from people thinking the character is straight. Manny's (Rico Rodriguez's) character doesn't resemble any human being on the planet. He's too cartoonish (sitcoms have always had kids who act like adults and adults who act like kids) and neither funny nor well-acted. On the positive side, Ed O'Neill is amazing as Jay Pritchett. As he was in ""Married, With Children"", he's like a comedy machine, delivering every line perfectly. To sum up, Modern Family is funny and entertaining but not particularly witty and intelligent, and uses a kind of soft-edged, sentimental satire that flatters, but doesn't challenge, the audience's ability to laugh at itself."
"I think this is a great series, I think Mitch and Cam are hilarious. And while this show is certainly mostly funny, for me personally it's frustrating how in every episode, they are always lying to each other or hiding things. So for me, it takes away from the comedy aspect. Lots shows do however display this kind of behavior towards each other (for drama, obviously) so I'm not very surprised. That goes to say that trying to look past it, the episodes can be funny and sometimes lighthearted. After they apologize for lying to each other for the millionth time."
"You'll end up like me, binge watching it until 5 AM (and I don't even know anything about chess). Very well written, directed and acted."
"The Queen's Gambit was a random find for me. I started watching it without any expectations but the first episode was just enough to keep me interested. As I kept watching, it kept getting better and I must say the 7th episode was one of the best finale to a series that I have ever watched. The character developments for even the minor characters were well-thought-out and I immediately formed an emotional connection with most of them. The finale was so well done that it almost felt like an end to a show with several seasons rather than a limited series. The show also had very good messages sprinkled in between, they were subtle and didn't make me feel like an agenda was being showed down my throat. The acting was marvelous. The cinematography was great with some very impressive scene transitions. The score was amazing and really set the atmosphere and the tone of the show. If you are reading this before watching the show, go ahead and watch it. You won't be disappointed."
"When you've seen everything on Netflix, a you will watch any new show they throw at you. I did not have high expectations. But I was so wrong. So wonderfully and totally wrong. We watched Queen's Gambit, all seven hours of it, in a single sitting. This show is an absolute gem. Remarkable acting by Anya Taylor-Joy who will be a force to be reckoned with, her child counterpart- an absolute marvel. The series is smart, it's inspiring at times, it's sad and heartbreaking at times. Who knew watching game-plays of simulated chess can make your heart pound out of your ears? Truly, a story of determination, friendship, self discovery, struggle and triumph. I don't know about you, but my ceiling will be covered in chess pieces tonight."
"It's not only a good series, it's not only the wonderful story, acting, cinematography, music. You watch it and it feels like the movie itself is a chessgame. With a rather weak opening indeed, a fabulous middlegame and a perfect ending. It's the kind of movies/series that stucks you in your armchair, on your couch or even in your bed anyway, forgetting about eating, sleeping, living. After the end, the return to reality has not yet occurred. You are still tormented in dimly lit orphanages, you travel all over the world, you are welcomed in super-bright chess tournaments a little more arrogant and well-dressed and you analyze variants. Do not miss it!"
"Watched it all in one night. I didn't think a story about chess would keep me interested. But this one got me deeply invested. Because this is not just about the game of chess, it's so much more.

Ultimately, what I cared about wasn't just the game anymore, it was the person. I was rooting for her. I really cared what would happen to her and that's probably the most essential thing for me when watching any tv series.

What made me attached to this character was how I saw her grow up from a little orphan girl, witnessing her from the first chess game all the way to the end and everything in between. I was enthralled, inspired, moved, proud. Had me in tears too. Excellent cast, story, cinematography, writing, everything. Thank you for this. Thank you."
Really enjoyed this series. One reviewer gave a low rating mentioning how the first episode showed her using pills in the orphanage....yes they had to as it shapes the rest of her future. The characters are great and the acting on is superb. Kept me hooked!
"Yes, yes, Anya Taylor-Joy and those eyes. Superb, praise from the rooftops.

But let's also acknowledge that the astonishing Isla Johnston carries the first few episodes with an equally compelling performance, far beyond her years.

The handover from Isla to Anya is almost seamless, which is quite remarkable when we consider the intensity of the character. That an actor of Johston's age could have pulled that off is extraordinary."
"Top to bottom, scenic design, wardrobe, direction and casting, this is a top notch production. The acting is seamless and the characters embody their roles perfectly.

One couldn't hope for a more original or more compelling story. As you might expect from the title, Chess plays a central role, and the author's use of the game as an extended metaphor shifts in ways both nuanced and explosive. For any thinking person, this series is sure to delight.

In my opinion, strong characterization always provides the best entertainment. The producers of ""The Queen's Gambit"" tackle the tough task of creating a compelling story from the inner lives of the characters. Granted, they are working from an excellent novel, but oftentimes, attempts to bring works that center around the mental, rather than the physical journey of the central character fail miserably. In this case, the producers deserve the highest praise. If you like thoughtful stories that expose the inner lives of the characters, don't miss this one.

The show, while generally acceptable for children, contains several adult themes, so parental guidance is recommended."
"I did like the story, I did like the settings, I did like the acting and the chess theme. But as the story progressed I started to feel slightly annoyed by the main character, additionally the story got boring as it was always the same, nothing really compelling happened. I did watch till the end, but I didn't find this series overly exceptional as other reviewers did. However, I really liked the depiction of that era and how difficult it was for women at that time."
"This is not the typical type of show that I would usually watch but I'm so glad I did. It's so unique and different that it's difficult to put into words. If you're thinking of watching this show, just do it, you won't be disappointed."
"Starts great, gets boring and repetitive, great but obvious end. Awesome music, photography and direction."
"This TV Mini-series is excellent! It is wonderful to see Anya Taylor-Joy in a well crafted show. She shines brilliantly as Beth Harmon a chess playing prodigy. The story takes us from when she is a small girl, orphaned, continuing through her teenage angst years. I highly recommend this show. Great cinematography and directing and of course to get back to the acting - its top notch! I only wish there was more than 7 episodes."
I don't normally review shows but this one was fantastic! I watched the entire series in less then 24 hours and would watch it again in a heartbeat. Every episode is good. It stays strong the entire series and captivates you. I would not be surprised if this show wins tons of awards. 10/10 would recommend.
After the first two episodes I cancelled my friday night plans to watch this series in one sitting.
You will binge watch this like I did guaranteed. What an amazing 8 hour movie.
I was absolutely blown away by how good The Queen's Gambit was! The only reason I actually started watching it was because of all the great ratings/reviews and I'm glad I did because it was such an entertaining series. It's set during the Cold War era and follows orphaned chess prodigy Beth Harmon (Anya Taylor-Joy) as she struggles with addiction in her quest to become the greatest chess player in the entire world. Taylor-Joy has been a rising star for the last few years but she breaks out here as she was just absolutely terrific as the lead. She's now one of the hottest young actresses in Hollywood. This ended up winning an Emmy for most Outstanding Limited Series.
I actually didn't really have any plans on actually watching The Queen's Gambit when I first saw the trailer. Then I couldn't stop hearing about how good this show was by just about everyone and saw all the award nominations it's gotten so I figured I'd give it a chance. I'm so glad I did. I never thought a series based around chess would be so entertaining. I couldn't stop watching and ending binging all 7 episodes over one weekend. Anya Taylor Joy deserves every bit of love she's received for her job in this. She's become a really good actress. This show will hook and will have you thinking about chess non stop but you don't need to know anything about chess to enjoy this. It's so much more than a series about chess.
"I found this entertaining, but I couldn't bring myself to like the main character, Beth, or care much about her ""journey"". The progression was pretty boring and obvious. I consider this worth watching if you are having a hard time finding something, but ignore the hype or you may end up disappointed like I was."
"While I am an avid chess player, you do not need to love chess in order to love this series. This is the first time I have ever given a rating a perfect 10. The cast is beyond amazing, Anya Taylor-Joy did an outstanding job. The story and writing was brilliant. The cinematography was perfection and captured every little detail for the time period. The music was perfect!

The only disappointment is that there probably will not be a season two."
"Imagine your standard, come-from-behind, feel-good sports movie, but with chess. The plot isn't exactly the same, but it's just as banal. In spite of being 5 times longer, its characters are just as shallow. The way they briefly touch on racism/sexism/addiction seem designed more to score brownie points and support the audience's sense of moral superiority than engage the audience in any form of critical thinking. What little chess they show in this series seems wildly unrealistic, from the rapid-fire moves to the clapping during play. I had trouble believing someone who looks 28 playing a 13-year-old character.

But hey, the cinematography is great, and like those cheesy sports movies, you can count on a warm fuzzy feeling at the end."
"Enjoyed this series but like many other reviews I found the storyline was slow, predictable, cliches to the brim & wonder if it needed to be a series rather than a movie. I mainly hung around to see the sets rather than the storyline. I didn't like the main character & was disappointed with the concept of her brilliance as a chess player throughout the series. Defs not feeling like its a 9 or 10 rating."
You know it's good when you don't care were your cellphone is.
An incredible series. An absolute joy to watch and a complete surprise. Anya Taylor-Joy was wonderful. I honestly have never heard of her and she was absolutely perfect for the role. I would have loved to see it last so much longer.
"As you can tell by reading through most of these reviews, Arrested Development is loved by just about everyone who's seen it. It ended only after three seasons which was way too soon for such a great show. Netflix renewed it 8yrs after it went off the air. Season 3 was in 2005 and it wasn't until 2013 until season 4 finally made its debut. But those first few seasons were so good that it didn't still have to put this among my favorite sitcoms of all-time! It's about the Bluth family and how one of the sons, Micheal Bluth (Jason Bateman), takes over the family business and affairs when his father George Bluth (Jeffrey Tambor) goes to prison. This family is so dysfunctional that they make Michaels life impossible. If you haven't seen this yet then do yourself a favor and watch it asap!"
"Arrested Development really is one of the funniest and most underrated tv shows ever created, especially the first three seasons! As most of the reviews have already said the quality dropped off for the last 2 seasons when it came back after taking a few years off. But those first few seasons were so good that it makes this show an all-time great sitcom!"
"Seasons 1-3: 10/10

Season 4 (Original edit): 6/10

Season 4 (Re-edit): 6/10

Season 5: 6/10

This show really dipped in quality once Netflix picked it up. The new seasons still have their moments, but it never lived up to the original episodes."
"This show takes a few episodes before you *really* GET it. And once you get it, you'll realize why everybody thinks it's one of the best sitcoms ever.

Each character is really defined and original...with real, unique personalities. All of the actors have fantastic chemistry, making for really great interactions and relationships within the show.

The writing for this show is great, and the plots are so absurd that you can't help but find them funny.

A refreshing change in a world where people like reality shows...it's the only good sitcom left."
"First three seasons were like best thing you could see in a sitcom ever. But from 4th season it's all going downhill. I couldn't even get through season 5. If it wasn't for last two seasons, this show would have been my favourite sitcom."
"This is the funniest show currently on television. All you need to enjoy this show is an appreciation for high-quality acting and incredibly hilarious writing. Jason Bateman as Michael Bluth is perfect as the under-appreciated do-good guy who's just trying to keep his family together and himself sane. Other highlights of the show include Will Arnett as GOB (George Oscar Bluth II), Michael's lame-excuse-for-a-magician brother; Jeffrey Tambor as George Sr., Michael's incarcerated father (he was jailed for ""shifty accounting practices""); and Michael Cera as George Michael Bluth, Michael Bluth's perpetually nervous 13-year-old son (who just happens to have a strange infatuation with his cousin, Maebe, played by ""State of Grace""'s Alia Shawkat). All in all this show is sure to be a hit, at least with those people whose level of understanding of comedy is above slapstick and bathroom jokes. TREMENDOUSLY hilarious writing and outstanding performances by the whole cast will have you laughing the whole time. Ten out of ten!"
Season 4-5 were not necessary and kinda ruined it. The show was ahead of it's time it its is perfect for streaming. Seasons 1 to 3 is the funniest show of all time.
"You've doubtless heard fans rave and rave about this show, and may have even checked it out. The camp is sharply divided, people either absolutely love it, or tend to just ""not get it."" In that sense it may not be for everyone (great television, and great art in general, rarely is), and to each his own. But after watching each season multiple times, I can easily say that it is the funniest show that I have ever seen by an ENORMOUS margin. Even after many repeat viewings, I still end up in tears all the time.

DVD treats this series well simply because it suits itself to rapid digestion (and after getting hooked, you won't be able to get up). The writers include many, many running gags that persist through entire seasons, or even the entire series (""I've made a huge mistake."" ""Her?""). The entire cast is extremely WELL cast and everyone's comedic timing is spot on. The real stars are David Cross as Tobias, and Will Arnett as GOB. Their physical comedy is drop dead hilarious as well. But Jessica Walters and Jeffrey Tambor are phenomenal, the former most especially in the third season.

As others have stated there is no laugh track and this is part of what throws some of the ""we don't get it"" camp off. The humor is very fast paced as well, and many of the biggest laughs are very subtle physical comedy, or a line of dialog that is dropped in the midst of a conversation. Some of the music that was written for the show is absolutely hilarious as well, especially the song that plays often when George Micheal is put in an awkward (sexual) situation (""whatcha trying to say to me??"").

Start with season 1, give it 4 episodes (go through at least the episode ""key decisions"" which I believe is ep 4). If you're not hooked, or at least intrigued by then, its likely you wont be at all. But if you're like me, and MANY others, you'll find that you've just stumbled upon one of the greatest shows ever made. VERY highly recommended. 10/10"
"The main score is excluding the last 2 seasons. Judging by the first 3 seasons, this is one of the best sitcoms ever made but various factors led to it not doing so well while it ran and getting cut. It became a lot more popular after it had ended and word of mouth got around about how great it was. Due to popular demand and the show being cut so soon, there were rumors about it being revived for years but unfortunately that didn't happen until Netflix decided to pick it up about 7 years after the last season.

I don't know what happened with season 4, but the end result was a season with some big issues and lacking the clever comedy of the first 3 seasons. Season 5 was released nearly 5 years later that unfortunately was also very disappointing. I suspect a key person or people were not involved in season 4 and 5 (like Larry David was not involved in the last few seasons of Seinfeld, though the drop in quality wasn't as severe) or Netflix people butted in too much thinking they knew better.

Again, the first 3 seasons are excellent and up there with other top sitcoms. Several of those sitcoms also had disappointing seasons towards the end, just most had made it at least 5 seasons before the quality started to decline. Arrested Development most likely would have been similar had Fox not canceled it after season 3."
"I'm excluding those seasons because I barley watched season 4 as it was unbearable, and I didn't even attempt to watch season 5. To me, Arrested Development is 3 incredible seasons of inventive, clever, witty television. This show was so funny. I loved the use of narration, visual gags, running gags, and how they contributed to the storytelling. It was always very well written, and the cast was amazing. They all bought something very distinct to their characters. I particularly liked Gob and Tobias the most, and Will Arnett and David Cross were both brilliant respectively. Loved this show, and it's a shame what it's slowly turned into."
Season 1-3 is good and funny but Season 4 & 5 is atrocious.
"I have seen a lot of great shows and a few bad ones. Arrested Development is brilliant, at least in my view. The show is well made visually, with very nice photography and sets that don't look cheap in any way. The music is memorable, particularly the theme tune, the story lines are well-structured with any big themes executed cleverly and the writing and jokes are some of the funniest and smartest I've seen. The characters are admittedly strange, but they are also unique and have their likability too, while the acting from the whole cast is consistently top-notch and the show even uses their guest stars in a creative way. All in all, funny, smart and engaging, quite simply a brilliant show. 10/10 Bethany Cox"
"Watching the first five episodes of Arrested Development Season 5 is like individually cutting off all five of my left fingers, with time in-between to contemplate just why I was exactly doing this, only to be told that just one more finger will make me finally see the true meaning of this activity.

I'm starting to feel like some fans are in serious denial. If seeing Jason Bateman on the screen is enough to make you forget about how terrible what you're watching is, then you're going to love this season. If not, I'd just stay away."
Great show till Netflix started making the show. Really enjoyed the first couple seasons and then Netflix took over and trashed it.
"Strange, Fox's promos almost made me miss out on this whole thing.

It's a sit-com made with very high standards, it's a career revival for Ron Howard, Henry Winkler and Liza Minelli, and it's a show that puts Fox's profile into HBO territory. ""It's Arrested Development""

""In fact..."", a Ron Howard quote that has become a cliché around our house, in fact, it's all those things and more. The writing is as good as everyone says it is, the cast is on par with that of Seinfeld or Roseanne. (Say what you will about her, that was a dream cast) Whenever new characters appear, they are inevitably played by people familiar to fans of edgy, intelligent humor. People like Jeffrey Tambor and Jason Bateman are dependably good, Michael Cera is a standout, and David Cross is finally being seen for the talent that he is.

The strongest thing I can say about this is that I find myself repeating various running gags, things that, like ""In fact..."", have become clichés. ""I've made a huge mistake."" ""I'm having the time of my LIFE in here!"" ""surprisingly cat-like"" ""Take a powder, willya fellas?""

This last one, uttered by Liza Minelli as Lucille Austero, sticks with me especially, and I hope that Liza stays with the show longer. As good as the principles are, she manages to outclass even them. The same with Henry Winkler, whose Barry Zuckercorn is the sort of lawyer television's been dying for. Among those main players, Lindsay and Tobias are pretty strange characters to begin with, but when you consider that they are an old married couple, that crosses the line into the bizarre. This show is full of people and situations you just won't see anywhere else, at least until other derivative shows start appearing.

Watch carefully, as there are many bit and pieces lingering in the background that you might miss. Recently, George Michael was dumped by his girlfriend. As he trudged home in a state of misery, you could hear sad Charlie Brown music. In the background, you could see a real - but bright red - dog house, with a real dog lying on top of it. It's things like these that tell me that the creators are just pleased to be doing this show for it's own sake, and that kind of love of the work shows through in the end.

Who knows if this show will last? There's an audience out there for this sort of thing, but they've generally settled into the Sunday night HBO schedule. Hopefully the Emmys, the word of mouth, and the critical raves will draw attention to this show. If not, we'll just have our A.D. dvds to keep us warm, and thank God for 'em!"
"There was a time during what is commonly known as The Golden Age of Television when the medium was used to communicate. It was used to entertain, inspire, and evoke a connection with the people. There was time in television when the programs would challenge not only the standard, but also the viewer. It started with things like Sanford & Son and All In the Family. Then the Richard Pryor Show shook people to the bone. From these gems came further explorations of the comic genre. We were treated to things like The Simpsons, Married With Children, and Seinfeld. Shows that broke the mold of the typical sitcom formula. They found their actors and made them stars. They didn't take washed up has-been film actors and try to turn them into the affable characters that they obviously were not. They simply took fresh talent and gave them the environment to get better and eventually captivate.

Then something terrible happened in 1993. A show, on what was supposed to be a music video network, got the idea to film real people living together in a house. From the first episode of The Real World, the Golden Age of Television was over. From this little show spawned a countless number of reality TV Shows that have paved the way for mind numbing experiences of watching people acting ""real"" while they are being filmed. It showed us all that not only is this medium of television completely unoriginal, but that it also provided people with insight into just how far somebody will go to get themselves on the airwaves. In 1994 something else happened. A little show called ""Friends"" hit the desk of the execs at NBC. From that we now have an endless string of formulaic, hokey, poorly written buddy sitcoms, all focusing on the same issues that plague the ""poor"" yuppie world that these people all seem to inhabit. Gone was the time when you didn't really need the laugh track; gone was the time of multi-plot line programming.

And then, something truly amazing and inspiring happened. In a collaborative effort from the Hurwitz Company and Imagine Entertainment came a brilliant piece of intelligent programming; a show that had no precedent. A truly talented ensemble cast, a brilliant writing team, and an amazing staff of directors and photographers that changed the art form like never before. Gone were the days of traditional, canned laughter sitcoms. It seems that we had all been saved from another infinite line of weak programs, and by whom? The FOX Network. Who would have thunk it? But then again, it made perfect sense. FOX brought us The Simpsons, Married With Children, and Family Guy. They had been known to challenge the bar that was set by regular programming. But instead of living on with those classics, it was forced to willow away in the doldrums of cancellation alongside other brilliant yet failed shows, like Action, Titus, and Greg the Bunny. Some people like to watch clichéd, overplayed, over done formulas every week. Some people like the safe humor, the one-two camera angles, the boring sets, and the canned laughter. Some people just don't want to think. The rest of usthe rest of us watch Arrested Development."
"Season 1: 8/10 Season 2: 10/10 Season 3: 9/10

I don't recognize the rest."
"I've seen a lot of basic comedy-shows and AV came as my epiphany.

Two things are making this show so perfect: 1) The character design... It's as simple as amazing. None of them seems to change at all but that's fine. Although they are all facing kinda the same situations again and again, it never gets boring. Michael, his son, Tobias and George Bluth are my favorites.

2) The situations that are being created... Whether it's throughout the whole show or just a single episode of it - person A, B, and C are all dealing with their own hilarious stuff and somehow they end up in a single storyline. At that point, I don't even wanna know how it happened, yet my amusement level is at the top.

Not gonna watch S4 and 5 though. I had a blast with this so far and im satisfied with how it ended."
"10 stars belong to the Fox network run of the series. I still remember watching the debut season on Sunday evenings. The netflix reboot was just.........wrong and I knocked off 2 stars because it feels little more than a knock off than an actual continuation of the show. The reboot feels like there's 2/3rds less comedy in each episode compared to the shows in the first 3 seasons. Also, it does a really lousy job trying to pick things up years down the line. More clumsy than offbeat funny. They really could have done better. Maybe it tries too hard but its years too late, maybe it forgot the show had likable characters, maybe it was too busy trying to be a political allegory instead of being funny like, a sitcom. I guess it's true what they say about any art. You can't go back and pretend it's the same. Then again, there's a few netflix reboots that failed miserably after moving to that streaming service (Designated Survivor anyone??].

So the show has the appearance of a reality tv show/mockumentary about a rich family who ends up broke and mired in legal troubles. In the orginal run, it focused on the middle son of the family trying to keep the family and business going despite his desperation to abandon them. The show throws alot of comedic curves and stays fresh for awhile as things get more outlandish. I rank the oringal 53 episode run up there with Fawlty Towers considering the amount of jokes and gags stuffed into a single episode. It is incredible how much they got into one 23 minute episode. Its like a joke every 7 seconds and yet they still develop a story in that. Those first 3 seasons are the fastest feeling and most enjoyable binge watching experience of all time.

Arrested Development had a very strong cult following (sadly lousy ratings) hence its demand for a reboot but honestly the first 3 seasons are a perfect bookend. It ends where it begins under similar circumstances but with opposite resolutions. One can only do so much for people who only think of themselves but are still somehow incapable of helping themselves. That was the lesson learned and leaving it there was right.

If you only know the series from its initial 3 season 53 episode run but never got around to the 4th and 5th season netflix run, you aren't missing anything. They're forgettable. The reboot is like those Gilligan's Island movies after that show ended or the Revenge of the Nerds movies that never made it to theaters. The fast paced humor is gone, the story is a mess, the premise restated during the opening credits is abandoned and instead of the narration helping fuel comedy, it turns into boring exposition most of the time. Like the plot and existence of the characters alone is meant to be the joke and the show was always about black comedy which it never was (more of a screwball comedy than anything else). I question if anyone involved in the reboot really wanted to do it for more than just money."
"*Note: My review refers ONLY to the original series (seasons 1-3).

What can I say ? This is a flawless and brilliant character-based gem of a comedy. The show's premise (how rich people would cope if they lost all their money) is ground for massive potential, and the show's creators do not disappoint. This show is also in a sense prophetic as it cleverly anticipated the boom of reality-TV, being shot in brilliantly amateurish fashion.

The story revolves around the super-wealthy Bluth family, rendered penniless after the patriarch is jailed for embezzlement. The one 'normal' son, Michael, tries to salvage his eccentric family as they get into blunder after blunder. This includes his elder brother Gob (a 'magician'), younger brother Buster (an 'academic'), twin sister Lindsay (an 'activist'), brother in law Tobias (an 'actor'), niece Maeby (a slacker), mother Lucille (sharp-tongued socialite) and son George Michael (an innocent).

The show is brilliant on so many levels, and the writing is incredibly smart. The show is highly quotable, and throughout its original 3 series never lost momentum. The beauty of this show is definitely the delusional characters. They all clearly suffer from a delusion of still being rich, and each character has a particular quirk. Even the supporting characters are brilliant (nods to Liza Minelli as Lucille Ostero, Henry Winkler as Barry Zuckercorn, Julia- Louis Dreyfuss as Maggie Lieser, and Ben Stiller as Tony Wonder).

Brilliant brilliant show, but I advise against watching Netflix's 2013 4th season. The 2003-6 run was epic."
"If you were allowed to pick only one show for your post-pandemic life, this would be the one."
"It was really really great show, but then came the Netflix and ruined it."
"This is, without a doubt, the greatest TV comedy in capturing the 2000s. It mocks the paranoia surrounding the Iraq War, the 24-hour news cycle, the housing boom and bust, and the cult of reality television without missing a beat.

It does all of that without ever seeming preachy or losing its charming sense of humor. There is no scene in the series that lacks the self- referential humor that characterizes the show, and almost every episode builds on the quirks of either one of the main characters or one of the many background characters of Orange County. Jason Bateman (Michael) does a solid job, but the real stars are the other members of the family. Michael Cera (George Michael), David Cross (Tobias Fünke), and Jessica Walter (Lucille) are particularly memorable.

I will never look at a seal, model homes, or Southern California itself without thinking about the wonderfully dysfunctional Bluths and the time that I spent watching them on ""Arrested Development.""

(I have seen this show several times over the years, but I have mostly recently watched in its entirety in June 2017)"
10 for the first three seasons but 4 for the last two! Id recommend watching the first three and nothing more. But for the first three MY GOD peak of sitcom comedy one of the smartest and funniest shows out there.
What is the deal with season 5? Are George Michael and Maeby supposed to still be teenagers? Why do they call the model home George Michael's childhood home? I knew it was over when GM punched his dad. Another great show has been ruined.
"I know it hasn't been long since it ended but I already miss Ozark. This show absolutely, without a doubt, lives up to all the hype it gets. It's a gripping thriller where the tension continues to build throughout each episode and each season and then pays off in a huge way. It really is a must watch show. People like to compare it to Breaking Bad and while I don't agree with that comparison because BB is the better show, Ozark is still terrific and worth every second. The one thing I can't stand about this show is Laura Linney's character (Wendy). While I don't mind Linney as an actress, because she's a pretty good one, in this she plays an annoying know it all who doesn't appreciate anything. Again, it's not her fault, it's just the way her character was written and as annoying as she was it still doesn't take away from the fact that this is such a great show."
"The first season was GRIPPING and by the first couple episodes so much had already been established in terms of development, suspense, and thrill. I loved Micheal and was rooting for his cause so that by the time season one ended I was ready for the same amount of quality, but to my surprise it slowed down considerably in season two, the whole season dragged on and although it was entertaining to watch it felt like there was a lull in the pacing. Whereas, in season one, by episode five we already had many over-acrhing plot lines, in season two there seemed to be too much a straight path for what the actions where going to be making it predictable.

Season two definitely had its surprising moments, but compared to season one is palled in comparison. Finally season three everything went downhill and there was no more suspense for me it felt like the show just dragged on and the characters lost their lustre and relatability. They had made terrible choice after terrible choice that I no longer cared what happened to the byrde's.

Overall it's a great show, with amazing acting from the whole cast. Jason Baetman did a fantastic job with the show, but unfortunately it succumbed to Netflix's plague of dragging on."
"The best way to describe Ozark is that it's just a flat out awesome show and a must watch! I'm so glad that I did finally start watching it because it's become one of my favorite shows of all-time. Everything about this show is excellent...the acting, writing, directing, production, cinematography, etc. Are all as good as it gets. The acting is so good that you really come to care for these characters and what happens to them even though they're not exactly the best human beings possible. I can not overstate just how good this show really is. It's one of the rare shows where every season is just as good as the others. The only negative would have to be the ending. While not the worst ending ever it's also not very good. It doesn't mean the show wasn't worth watching because you'll have fun for the majority of it but a little disappointed in the ending."
"Marty and his family move to the Ozarks to wash money for the mob. What ensues is a wild ride from beginning to end with the audience on tenterhooks for the most part.

The characters are wonderfully etched out and watching them cheat the inevitable is the most fun part of the 4 seasons.

Ruth Langmore (Julia Garner) is probably my favorite character, second only to Marty Byrde (Jason Bateman) and that's primarily because he's relegated to the backseat towards the end of the series.

While almost everyone tends to call this the Breaking Bad of money laundering, it is far more than that. At the heart of it, its about idealogical differences that are constantly pulling this family apart, while their toxic seeds end up affecting many innocent and not so innocent people along the way.

The series ends on a slightly salty note, but that shouldn't affect the journey.

My only grouse was that I hated Wendy Byrde (Laura Linney) with all my heart and I would've loved to see comeuppance for her.

My personal barometer for any show is that if I get anxious for the characters, its a good show. This show brought out my anxiety in spades.

Go watch!"
"In the gritty world of crime dramas, ""Ozark"" shines as a beacon of excellence, delivering a masterclass in tension, storytelling, and character development. With its dark and brooding atmosphere, impeccable performances, and intricate plot twists, this series is a rollercoaster ride that you won't want to end.

Jason Bateman's portrayal of Marty Byrde, a financial planner turned money launderer, is nothing short of extraordinary. His ability to seamlessly switch between charm and menace is a testament to his acting prowess. Paired with Laura Linney's captivating performance as Wendy Byrde, the power couple at the center of the chaos, the chemistry between the two leads elevates the show to new heights.

What sets ""Ozark"" apart is its unflinching look at the consequences of criminality and the lengths people will go to protect themselves and their families. The moral dilemmas faced by the characters are palpable, and the stakes are always high, keeping viewers on the edge of their seats.

The supporting cast is equally impressive, with standout performances from Julia Garner as the cunning Ruth Langmore and Tom Pelphrey as the troubled Ben Davis. Each character is fleshed out with depth and nuance, making the tangled web of alliances and betrayals all the more compelling.

With its intricate storytelling, impeccable direction, and haunting score, ""Ozark"" is a true gem in the world of television. It's a show that demands your attention and rewards it with richly layered narratives and heart-pounding suspense.

In conclusion, ""Ozark"" is a must-watch for any fan of gripping drama and intricate character studies. With a rating of 9/10, this series cements its place as one of the finest shows on television today."
This series is a home run for Netflix. Its a gripping series with superb casting for every character. It is an edge of your seat thriller that grips the audience from the very start. Throughout each episode you are helplessly wondering how Jason Bateman's character will pull through. The writers of the show are spot on with every twist. I highly recommend giving this series a chance and i can't wait for season 2 to come out. From the first episode to the last it is a brilliant masterpiece that deserves better reviews than other people have given. %100 one of the best new series of the year.
"I just finished watching this show for a second time and I have more appreciation for it this time 'round. All the actors mange to achieve a perfect balance of comedy, drama, and pain. One second you're rooting for Wendy, the next you hate her! Same with Ruth, Darlene, Jonah and Charlotte - even Marty! Each character manages to display such a wide range of motivations and emotions. Don't get me started on the cinematography! Each shot appears so intentionally artistic, drawing attention to exactly where it needs to be, revealing things about the direction of the plot and characters without words. I could go on for ages about how much I adore this show. Please give it a watch if you haven't already."
"The first seasons were solid, great actors and story. At the end of season 3 and going into 4 I got tired of the byrds, they are getting more desperate and it got more unbelievable. The story got more of the same and glad it wrapped up. I'm glad they don't drag on the story and keep it to these 4 seasons."
"Ozark was such an amazing show during his 3 first seasons, a masterpiece of drama combining poignant intrigue, mastered production, meticulous writing touched by a dose of skillfully distilled black humor. It's was one of my favorites shows and one of the few that I rated 10 but now i just give it a 9 because the season finale has completely ruined my love for this show because this season 4 was so bad oh my god...

Season 4 is lack of action, tension or typical Ozark's plot twist/violence. The pace is extremely slow and storyline does not conclude properly. Everything goes so fast around the last 30 minutes, and so many questions to answer. It's predictable, and weak compared to the quality of the 3 first seasons, did they switch of writers or what ?

There was characters coming in and out and one minute they all hate each other and then don't. It was just inconsistent and felt like they weren't sure how to finish everything. A lot of plots ultimately lead to nothing more than a pointless storyline.

The ending is a joke, it doesn't feel like an ending. Just a regression of most of the characters and the final scene is nonsense in every conceivable way. Ozark ending fails while Sopranos ending doesn't. The writers did not spend any effort on the final and find how to resolve the built-up tension through four seasons! It felt like a last-minute homework of a terrible student. What a waste, this season finale just ruins the show !"
"I never would have watched this if not for the quarantine. It wasn't promoted well. I LOVED IT! Great script, tons of action and characters that you love to hate and hate to love."
"It was a very riveting series with lots of twists and turns throughout. The characters were very real people, very believable situation in these times with the cartels in this world. It is not a show in my opinion for a young audience even though it's not hard to believe this is how things are for real people in the underworld of drug cartels and weapons etc. My only complaint is that the show was very hard to view, it is very dark. A lot of the show it was like watching a black screen. It was frustrating wondering what was taking place for a lot of it. All in all great acting and a good story line."
Ozark is pretty much what you'd expect it to be. Its a pretty tense what-is-he-going-to-do-now type of storytelling that makes it easy to binge-watch.It also holds your attention as Jason Bateman plays a similar kind of character as the likable anti-hero keeps falling in trouble.Similar to breaking bad but also quite different.
I loved Ozark through ALL it's seasons but the final episode did not do the series justice. It frankly left me flat and disappointed. It left giant holes in the plot and could've done some characters better justice.
"Ozark sets itself in a high stakes environment and carries that high intensity throughout the series . The episodes and story are easy to watch and don't drag anything too much . As someone who gets bored very quickly , it kept me on my seat from the beginning .

Jason Bateman gives an exceptional performance . Probably the most likable anti-hero ever . Same goes for all the other characters in the Byrde family .

However in spite of all of this , the ending left me utterly confused and disappointed and looking for answers . I felt that the writers had created something that they could not handle and thus fumbled the ending with so many open threads .

I highly recommend it regardless of that . You will enjoy . Go in with an open mind . Also stay off reddit and the wiki to avoid spoilers."
"While this is definitely Luke Cage's show, this isn't the first time we've seen him. Being an integral part of Jessica Jones season 1, this is the continuation of that character and while it doesn't exactly goes the same heights as Jessica Jones or Daredevil, it's a damn good time

Season 1; Fresh off the action packed season of Daredevil season 2, I seen this was where our Netflix MCU story continues, further establishing The Defenders roster. Really glad they explained Luke Cages powers in this season( machine used to heal faster malfunctioned while Cage was in it) Taking place sometime after Jessica Jones Season 1's ending, we see Luke Cage ditch Hells Kitchen for Harlem Which sets the backdrop for the many characters we meet. First we have Cottonmouth; a ruthless nightclub owner who gets a visit from Shades, an associate of Cottonmouths employer Diamondback. Now, before I start talking about the characters, let me first off and say how great some of these scenes in this very first episode was. That entire scene of Cottonmouth giving his ""everybody want to be the king"" monologue was *chefs kiss*. Anyways, I think Ali did a great performance, and sadly was cut too short midway through the season. Meanwhile we have another character named Detective Misty who becomes a integral part to the entire Defenders roster. And of course, the return of Claire... visiting her mother in Harlem, with a calling to help people with abilities. 2 more characters, Mariah and Shades, are also prominent in this, with becoming some of the best written villains in the show. And finally; Striker/Diamondback. Oh and he happens to be Cages half brother! S**t just got real. The ending fight between Luke and Styker was fun, but corny at the same time, A good season, although some stuff was corny, especially Diamondback, and there was a lot of uneventful episodes, but other than that, a great season.

Season 2: Now, this season is set after The Defender miniseries, so we see Cage becoming more of a celebrity, but he's also forced to deal with not only the partnership between Mariah and Shades, but he also has a newcomer in Harlem. Bushmaster proved to be a pretty convincing villain, with his goal to wipe out Mariah and take what what rightfully was his. While I don't think any of the characters quite matched Cottonmouth's, I think this season fleshed out and made both Shades, Mariah, and Bushmaster a trio of villains that each had their own goals and demons to figure out. Now, the ending was pretty interesting, and would like to see that more in the future, perhaps is a future Luke Cage show???

In all, this 2 season show was pretty cool. It gave this universe a vibe I think it may have been missing, and to see street crime being dealt with with such a charming guy as Luke Cage, you can't complain. Definitely recommended."
"I enjoyed 'Luke Cage' like all Netflix-Marvel TV shows and gave it a 7/10. The acting, especially Mike Colter's portrayal of Luke Cage, was solid, bringing the character to life. The music and overall atmosphere of Harlem were standout elements, enhancing the series' unique identity. Casting choices were well-suited, and the cinematography captured the gritty urban setting effectively. The directing maintained a consistent tone throughout. However, the writing occasionally suffered from pacing issues and narrative detours, affecting the overall flow. Its strength lies in its exploration of themes like community and power, but it could have benefited from tighter storytelling. 'Luke Cage' is a worthy addition to the Netflix-Marvel lineup, offering a distinctive take on the superhero genre."
"Luke Cage, although not in the top three of marvel-Netflix shows is still really good. I think that it has the best presentation and aesthetic but lacks somewhat in execution. The latter half of season one takes a dive in quality and the final seconds of the show ruins the character of Luke Cage in my opinion. But I still think it had the potential to be so much better. If Disney gave this show another shot with the same people but maybe gave some course correction along the way with the other people from the marvel-Netflix shows it could be a really good stylish show."
"While the storyline plods along, the characterization is strong, especially with regard to Alfre Woodard's breakout role. She reminds us of what the complexity of a villain looks like, and she explores every part of what it means to be filled with avarice, love, desire, intelligence, and hate. She makes this show better for its unsure plot at times."
"As a huge fan of Marvel I'm a little biased because I pretty much like everything they put out. My bias aside, Luke Cage is terrific. If you don't believe me just read through the reviews here and look at the ratings. Even the critics loved this show. It's about a fugitive who gets super strength after an experiment goes wrong. He moves back home to Harlem to try to rebuild his life and make his home a safe place from all the terrible people try to take over. Now that it's on Disney plus maybe they can bring him back. They've already started to bring back others and recently renewed Daredevil so there's still hope. Even if they don't bring him back for his own show again, at least bring him back into the MCU through another show like the Daredevil revival. If you're a Marvel fan then this is a must watch."
"The show isn't without its flaws. There are elements of the script that feel slightly generic, cliched, unfocused, or heavy-handed, but the sheer strength of the performances, particularly Mahershala Ali's Cottonmouth and Alfre Woodard's Mariah, as well as Luke Cage himself and Rosario Dawson's Claire, keep the show engaging even when it occasionally stumbles. There's some solid action, too, and a quality rendition of Luke Cage's origin story."
"Love the Netflix MCU, but Luke Cage stood out the most from the pact. Mike Coulter is charismatic and a hit with the ladies on top of being a powerhouse of a superhero. The way Luke has to overcome being labeled an ex-con for spending time in prison for a crime he didn't commit, to the way he was forced to come out of hiding and become the hero he was ment to be because of the tragic murder of his friend. Luke Cage takes you on a righteous journey.

Luke Cage, Jessica Jones, Dare Devil,Punisher, and Iron Fist(in that order) surprised me on how well put together they are. I hope the MCU find a way to bring all these guys back in."
"Luke cage was pretty decent, I would say it's action, a lot of really cool scenes, some episodes and scenes were a bit boring, some episodes can be a bit slow too, but most episodes were good, it wasn't the best show ever but it's still a good one, I still enjoyed the show."
"Luke Cage starts off great with a strong classic noire vibe in a modern coat of paint. A strong cast creates a powerful atmosphere and tone that draws you in. Mike Colter clearly looks the part of an indestructible giant and plays Luke Cage in a somber and traditional ""tormented, silent protagonist"" kind of way, but it is the surrounding cast that truly brings out this jewel: Simone Missick as the honest officer from the street, Mahershala Ali as the tormented gang leader, Frank Whaley as the smart mouth sidekick cop, Alfre Woodard as the congresswoman stuck in both the future and the past, Frankie Faison as the mentor and spot of light in the dark.

Sadly as the story progresses through the season and especially about half way through with some major shake up of the status quo, much of the great character nuances and complex relationships that had started to develop were taken in a very different direction and new characters were given more screen time. This I think was a mistake; not only because in its current iteration replaced focus of interesting characters and arcs with something very straight forward and boring, but also because it happened so soon in the series.

Such a significant shake up would have been much more suitable for a season finally and with a second season dealing with the fallout and changing landscape for our cast to traverse, not as a throw in at the half way mark.

All in all the first half of the series was a clear 8 for me and the second half about a 6 so on average it comes out a 7, Good, but not a must watch."
"While Luke Cage is not quite as good as The Punisher or Daredevil, it's still a very good, action packed show that is absolutely worth watching! It's another Netflix Marvel show that is outstanding. It's just too bad that they had to part ways because I loved all 5 of their shows, some more than others but all still good. Mike Colter was terrific as Luke Cage!"
"Season 1:

Already introduced in Jessica Jones, the titular character is given an opportunity to become far more three-dimensional. With the emphasis heavily reliant on race, Luke Cage was released at an important time within US racial tensions, and was an excellent addition into a rather uniform Marvel universe.

Against the backdrop of Harlem, issues are split by the villains, of which there are multiple, and general life effected by race. Perhaps not to be fully appreciated by the entire audience, but at the very least understood by virtually all.

The standard of villain does fluctuate across the season. Cottonmouth is perfectly played by Ali, and provides an adversary without powers, just power. Equally evil and engaging, he provides an instant arc whilst Cage's backstory unwraps. Dillard is a very different character, irritating and at times infuriating for an audience, she gives a different direction and reflects the real world all too well. Diamondback is frankly a bit daft, everything seems a little over the top, and whilst Cottonmouth is slick and cool, his associate feels a little goofy. These are all surrounded by an entourage which fill the gangster-gaps well.

Other characters are given glimpses to flourish, notably Temple who finally gets more of a limelight after her introduction in the other Defender series. Detective Knight is at the forefront of many episodes, and whilst a decent addition, does fall back on cliche and stereotype a little too often - such as showing how tough she is and her origins from the streets by gaining information from youths by beating them at basketball. It's good that nothing ever strays too far from Cage - no matter how incompetent/corrupt the cops may get.

There are great references to the comics in his origin story, and whilst Cage is given far more depth, he does get stuck as the figure of a black man trying to do right, without getting developed a whole lot further.

Season 1: 8/10

Season 2:

Continuing on from The Defenders, Luke Cage seamlessly slips back into the same Harlem with the same approach. However, unlike the first season, emphasis on race, whilst remaining at the forefront of everything, is shallow, crass dialogue being the reference point rather than anything deeper.

Dillard is front and centre and ranges from a decent to a terrible character; from realistic to a figure fueled by stereotypical dialogue. At every opportunity she's referring to 'black this' and 'black that', usually being someone's 'black ass'. Her relationship with Shades becomes cringeworthy, although he is given more room to develop in this season. The addition of another in the Stokes bloodline is unwelcome as the wide eyed doe repeatedly gets manipulated until you lose all sympathy. It was clear by the last episode that should the series have continued, it would have been a third series again revolving around a Stokes. Bushmaster, however, is an excellent villain with depth, relatability and excellently played by Shakir. The choreography for his actions scenes are excellent.

Temple is far less involved in the second season, which isn't a negative as she sadly starts to fall into the category of poorly-written female characters in the Marvel-Netflix series. Self-righteous and preachy, she falls in line with similar disappointments in Daredevil (Karen), Jessica Jones (Trish) and Iron Fist (Colleen), who could be good characters unfortunately sullied in certain arcs by insisting their approach is superior to the way the lead actually conducts (more interesting) actions.

Dialogue is really heavy-handed (no pun intended) at times; you hear ""can I give you a hand"" or similar all too often in the opening episodes when taunting someone with a missing limb, suggesting that everyone in this universe is either too thick or unoriginal to come up with anything else better than a playground insult. Plus, while race is obviously key to the series, it also becomes a crutch as everyone uses it as an excuse for their behaviour one way or another.

Seemingly every episode has a musical performance in it, which works well in some cases and poorly in others. Shoehorning this repeated section in turns the season into a weird musical.

Overall, quality rises and falls, but the latter half of the season has a lot of solid plot to engage with. Violence gets a whole lot more graphic, but choreography in fight scenes are far advanced. The ending is somewhat predictable, but not unwanted.

Season 2: 7/10."
"I was looking forward to this more so than the other Marvel Netflix shows, but Luke Cage is easily the weakest of the bunch.

The show improves throughout its run, but it really only picks up over the last few episodes. The story is not compelling, the acting is troublesome at times (mostly early on), and Cage's story arc and motivation (or lack thereof) leaves much to be desired for most of the first season. At times it's hard to believe he's the same character who first appeared in Jessica Jones.

The biggest issue is the tedium. The director appears to have a problem with story telling, but the real issue is there just isn't enough material to fill each episode. Every hour drags on and on. It's awkwardly punctuating by musical numbers that will not be appealing to most viewers with frequent cuts back and forth which simply interrupt the consequential moments of each episode instead of accentuating them.

The villains are too weak for the season to drag on as it did. Cage is very overpowered in this series (far more powerful than in Jessica Jones) and there's no plausible reason he doesn't mop things up by the end of the first few episodes. To account for this, much of the show is filler. Some of the reviews I've seen remark how much character development there is on the supporting cast as one of the show's strengths. Honestly, it seems to be a glaring weakness. Not only is this too, filler, the character development is poor. It not only doesn't explain who these people really are and in fact detracts from the characters as you see how weak and ineffectual the rest of the cast is.

In reality, Cage could have pimp slapped the villain out of Harlem at any point in the entire series and they could have moved on to a new and better story line."
"Luke Cage (Mike Colter) received superpowers when he was experimented on in a private prison. He has super strength and impenetrable skin. He returns to his Harlem neighborhood to fight local crime lord Cottonmouth (Mahershala Ali) and other villains. Misty Knight (Simone Missick) is a police detective fighting for justice.

I really like Mike Colter and I really like the character of Luke Cage. The show does struggle to maintain story flow over the full 13 episode seasons. Nevertheless, it delivers quite a good punch in the Netflix Marvel Universal. Colter is able to maintain narrative drive all by himself. He is a compelling character and I hope he stays in the Marvel universe despite the cancellation due to the pending Netflix Marvel streaming war."
"First season was messy, a little boring and a little unwatchable. Season two was solid and the characters were amazing. The development of Mariah, Hernan and Tilda were amazing! Extra props to Hernan; he was absolutely amazing to watch. Luke's small conflict suited him; he didn't need a big losing-himself-and-finding-himself arc - that was well done. Even the Jamaican dude was well done. Loved Danny's cameo!

(The ending, though.. what the hell lol)"
"There's a lot to say about this series but I think the most obvious is how underwhelming the main character is. Colter comes off as rejected, docile, and often simple. There's background of him being a former cop but his intellect as Luke Cage seems far too simple for any skills of the sort. That along with the monotonous tone he takes throughout each episode really diminishes the character. The supporting cast works well and they are engaging and entertaining; especially Cottonmouth. The musical cameos are great as well and remind me of the old New York Undercover TV series when every episode featured someone new in the background. My only complaint is Luke Cage himself.. in the comics he was an active and athletic guy that didn't walk around in hoodies all of the time speaking with his ""inside voice."" This is like Luke Cage on Ritalin."
"This show is pretty cool, it's thoroughly enjoyable, good acting and cast, the first season drags a bit.

My only issue is this show has to bring everything back to blame a white man or blame the police.

The story is black on black violence but they blame the police for stopping it, exclaiming Luke is on the run not because he's bulletproof but because he's black.

This just highlights how a lot of black folk blame everyone else instead of themselves, the writers should've done a better job.

"Although some of the storylines can sometimes be drawn out a little too long, this is still a solid series overall with a very solid cast, most importantly Mike Colter who beautifully bring Luke Cage to life."
This is a fine series for all viewers to watch. The crew could have worked on this series to make ir better. There was some room for improvement. The storyline of this series was a bit weak as well. It needed something else. The cast selection could have been better. They did not fully connect to the storyline nor to their respective characters. The chemistry between the cast members was weak. This series reveals to viewers the importance of equality. Both colour and culture helped create the world of today and unfortunately it is still an issue that is not discussed more. There are many issues that need to be discussed more. This alright series could have been better.
"Not sure why so many people are down on Luke Cage and Iron Fist, but if I were to rate the different series, I would rate Jessica Jones as my least favorite, although I found season 2 to be so much better than season 1. Keep them all going strong."
"As a fan of old school hip-hop, the music Easter eggs and cameos made the show a great pleasure to watch. The first thing I noticed when I saw the episode names was that they were all named after songs by Gang Starr. This got me hooked even before watching. I am not just basing this review on personal bias toward the music, but on the story told. This show takes place in an area that Daredevil and Jessica Jones have never been to; Harlem. With this new area comes new criminals and villains introduced into the MCU. There are many character with different backgrounds and stories that give the show an insight into the mind state of the people. Marvel, once again, has made a show with a great story, characters, and and overall get viewers hooked and satisfied. If you consider yourself a fan of the MCU, this is a must-watch. Hopefully this review was helpful and if you are planning on watch the show, hopefully you enjoy it as much as I did."
"This show is actually pretty good. Nice action scenes, I think they choosed the perfect actor for this role, look madly strong, is nice and are just a great actor. 🇺🇲"
"Luke Cage is a Neo Blaxploitation Masterpiece, a good balance of story, history and style. Never a dull moment, not gonna lie in season 2 Black Mariah gets a little cartoonish at times but still good. This show deserves another season or two."
"This series is model for how to do a cultural show without alienating any group.

Unlike pathetic and ruined shows like DC's ""Black Lightening"", and Marvel's two other loser super power series, ""Impulse"", and ""Cloak and Dagger"", Luke Cage writers don't hatefully target/blame any specific group, or whine about any snowflake social pc issues. It's just brilliant action and a smooth plot.

Extremely enjoyable to watch, Season 2 better than 1, I've upped my rate from a 6 to an 8.

I just hope there's not another two years to get Season 3!"
"Sons of Anarchy is absolutely, without a doubt one of my favorite shows of all-time. It's one of the few shows that I love so much that I've watched it all the way through several times and probably will again in the near future. The cast is absolutely incredible, led by the underrated Charlie Hunnam as Jax Teller. It also has so many other career performances by actors like Ron Perlman, Katy Segal, Tommy Flanagan, Ryan Hurst, Kim Coates and many more. If you haven't seen this yet I'm warning you now to give yourself enough time because you're going to want to binge it as fast as you can. Love, love, love this show!"
"Buckle up for a wild ride through the gritty and gripping world of Sons of Anarchy MC. From the first episode to the last, this series had me hooked like a fish on a line. I found myself glued to the screen, binge-watching every moment I could steal away.

The plot is a rollercoaster of twists and turns that keep you on the edge of your seat, constantly craving more. Just when you think you've seen it all, the story takes another unexpected detour, leaving you hungry for the next episode.

The cast is nothing short of phenomenal. Even the actors whose characters I didn't particularly care for brought an intensity to the screen that fueled the show's dramatic fire. It's their performances that truly ignite the tension and emotion, making every scene feel electric.

However, fair warning to those with a weak stomach: Sons of Anarchy MC doesn't shy away from the raw and brutal realities of its world. Some scenes are downright vulgar, but they serve to underscore the gritty authenticity of the series.

One standout aspect is the incredible work of the makeup artists. The wounds and injuries inflicted upon the characters look so realistic, it's almost unsettling. Their attention to detail adds an extra layer of immersion to an already immersive experience.

In conclusion, Sons of Anarchy MC is a must-watch for fans of intense drama and gripping storytelling. Just be prepared to buckle in tight and hold on for dear life."
"An infinitely inventive and good series.

But every single episode is just lies, hate, killing, dying, giving up.

The series is very addictive but at the same time makes you feel bad because of all the bad things in it.

Mixed thoughts when it's all over. While watching, you start to hate many characters and in the end you don't know who is good, bad or ugly.

Of the series, Yellowstone comes to mind the most, but the vests separate them from each other.

I can't really say who to recommend the series to and who not. I would think that the age limit for the series is different in different countries, but it is definitely intended for adults only. Not for teenagers.

It's hard to choose a favorite character, because everyone does the things mentioned above. All in all, a masterpiece that is sure to divide opinion on its content.

The actors, the direction, the script, the voices, everything is top notch."
"Sons of Anarchy is easily one of my two or three favorite shows I've ever seen. I really can't say enough about this amazing show that hasn't already been said, all you have to do is read through the reviews to see how loved this show really is. I know that people say this all the time about a ton of different shows but Sons of Anarchy is absolutely one of the best shows ever created! Every season is just as amazing as the others, which everyone knows is really rare for a tv show but which Sons of Anarchy definitely pulls off. Do yourself a favor and just go watch it. I promise it will not only meet your expectations but it'll pass them."
"I'm totally agree, creator Kurt Sutter is a craftmaster of comedy and suspense! Sexual education are no bad, scatolomania with great vision, drugs,weapons, murderer people, the highest horror, violence above people! An outlaw motorcycle club, SAMCRO they have everything, despite my ignorance of terror, I'm convinced that SOA could be most entertaining serial I may ever watched! It's funny heroic, maybe political and, most of all, energetic plot! Inside in gang you have juctice, last looks of main machine in the name of father -- all band is terrific mans power great actors, str8 performances! Claim leading by Charlie Hunnam who's destroyed competition, claim to be above the law of everything, chaos storytel , quantum of solace, friendship, brotherhood, family drama protecting value to be a superfluous in this world or to stay and live..!? Further proving his mastery of creating tension and thrills, Kurt Sutter has effectively created a satisfying blood story! Just as all drama series focuses on survival instincts, it seems that Kurt Sutter has found a way to resurrecting the same old scares..!? Really, this is Slavi's Show screenplay set up, fans of Harley Davidson, exotic booze, pistols and almost eleven years after the disastrous expedition to the distant moon called Hotel Julia and the hidden comunism against westworld freedom -- xaxa..!? Take it easy and have a nice road..!?"
I love Sons of Anarchy I have watched it so many times and it never gets boring. Probably helps that Jax Teller is very easy on the eye too. From the very first episode I was hooked as so much happened and it just got so much better with each season: there are some really hard things to watch at times with some of the sad deaths but they make the show what it is. I just wish that they hadn't ended it at season 7 as could have made so many more seasons including with the children of the show too but then I'm guessing that the last season would have played out so much different compared to what did happen. Must admit this is my least favourite season I'm guessing cos it's the last one of the show. I really hope that Kurt Surrey writes some more Sons shows as they are awesome. I have watched the spin off Mayans and that is nothing like Sons at all.
"Sons of Anarchy is great television but flawed to a fault. The flaws of SoA are very minor and the greatness of this series overshadows it by a long shot. The only problems the series has in my eyes is uncalled for humor, small little plot holes in the story, and noticeable cgi in very few parts. The show excels with a stacked cast of stars, twisted dark storytelling which make for tragic elements, and tons of blood. The show doesn't hold back on violence which make it one of the goriest crime drama series to date. Jax and Gemma's characters in the show are so complex and have a very bold storyline throughout the show. Lots of good side characters lots of shocking deaths. And an overall good finale for the show that felt like it stayed true to itself by the end."
"This show is easy watching when you want to unwind after a long day. It's entertaining with plenty of action and intertwining story lines but it has some major issues...

Awful acting, over the top stereotypes and ridiculous storylines. The gang somehow manage to get mixed up with every possible bad guy in the whole USA and Ireland along with several different divisions of police force and yet they always come out unscathed. There must be a hundred shootouts / explosions throughout the entire series yet our hero jax never gets more than a scratch on his pretty face.

You'll probably enjoy the show if you don't take it very seriously. Just accept the ridiculousness of it all and cheer on the bad guys with hearts of gold."
"I was very surprised at how much I love this show, I'm normally don't watch too many action series all the way through, I've watched this twice. The acting is superb and the interaction of characters is brilliant. I would've given it a 10, however the script occasionally goes too silly, especially the Irish season.

The bromance between Jax and Opie is spot on, I know people like this in real life

When the Club started drifting apart and breaking down some of Tig's exploits brought a lighter side to what was turning onto a deeply darker storyline to how it started.

I think I'm going to watch it again. You see something different or a different side to a person each time you watch it."
"""Sons of Anarchy"" is a television series that brilliantly reimagines Shakespeare's iconic tragedy, Hamlet, in a modern setting. With a rating of 10/10, it is a remarkable and powerful interpretation of the timeless tale.

The series follows the story of Jax Teller, who is essentially the Hamlet character in this contemporary retelling. Like Hamlet, Jax is torn between loyalty to his family and the desire for justice. He is haunted by his father's ghost and must navigate a treacherous world of power struggles, betrayal, and vengeance.

The parallels between ""Sons of Anarchy"" and Hamlet are skillfully woven into the narrative. The intricate family dynamics, the moral dilemmas, and the exploration of corruption and honor reflect the themes that Shakespeare explored in his play. The series beautifully captures the essence of Hamlet's internal conflict and the tragic consequences of his actions.

One of the standout aspects of ""Sons of Anarchy"" is its exceptional cast. Each actor brings depth and nuance to their characters, effectively embodying the complexity of their Shakespearean counterparts. Charlie Hunnam delivers a mesmerizing performance as Jax Teller, capturing the turmoil and intensity of the character with remarkable skill.

The writing of the series is superb, capturing the spirit and essence of Shakespeare while infusing it with the gritty realism of a biker gang. The dialogue is sharp, intelligent, and often poetic, mirroring the poetic language of Shakespeare's original work.

Furthermore, the production values of ""Sons of Anarchy"" are top-notch. The attention to detail in recreating the biker culture, the authentic set designs, and the visceral action sequences contribute to the overall immersive experience of the series.

In conclusion, ""Sons of Anarchy"" is a masterpiece of television that successfully reimagines Shakespeare's Hamlet in a contemporary and gritty setting. With its exceptional performances, brilliant writing, and masterful interpretation of the timeless themes of the original play, it earns a well-deserved rating of 10/10. Whether you are a fan of Shakespeare or simply appreciate compelling storytelling, ""Sons of Anarchy"" is a must-watch series that will leave a lasting impact."
"I'm quite late to the Sons of Anarchy hoopla. Better late than never. Quite frankly, Sons of Anarchy is one of the best shows I have ever seen. Charlie Gunman soars as Jax and leads a cast of extraordinary actors including Katie Sagal, Maggie Siff, Theo Rossi and Ron Pearlman. One of the shows most exciting fact is the creator, Kurt Sutter ---who is an absolute genius--was also Executive Producer, writer, director AND cast member p!aying Otto to which he deserved the Emmy. To my knowledge I dont know a show where kne individual wore so many hats. The show delivers all the action one would expect but at its core its a show about family, loyalty, belonging and ultimately betrayal. I watched the entire seven seasons in two weeks and during that time I was obsessed right up until the harrowing finale. The show stayed with me, and will continue to occupy a space in my head for a long time. Its my hope Mr Sutter resolves his issues with the studios involved in production to bring us he prequels and sequels a show this outstanding show warants."
"Get ready to dive headfirst into the dark and gritty world of SAMCRO with ""Sons of Anarchy,"" a raw and unapologetic portrayal of outlaw motorcycle clubs that pulls no punches. This adrenaline-fueled series is a rollercoaster of violence, betrayal, and moral ambiguity that will leave you both shaken and exhilarated.

At the center of the chaos is Charlie Hunnam's Jax Teller, a complex and tormented character torn between loyalty to his club and his desire to break free from the cycle of violence. Hunnam's magnetic performance anchors the show, portraying Jax with a brooding intensity and emotional depth that make him a captivating antihero.

The ensemble cast is a force to be reckoned with, with standout performances from Katey Sagal as Gemma Teller Morrow, the fierce matriarch of the club, and Ron Perlman as Clay Morrow, the ruthless former president grappling with his own demons. Each character is flawed and multi-dimensional, adding layers of complexity to the brutal world they inhabit.

""Sons of Anarchy"" is unrelenting in its depiction of the brutal realities of outlaw life, pulling no punches when it comes to violence, betrayal, and the high stakes of power struggles within the club. The moral grey areas explored in the series force viewers to confront uncomfortable truths about loyalty, family, and the cost of living outside the law.

The writing is sharp and provocative, weaving together intricate storylines that keep viewers on the edge of their seats. From internal power struggles to external threats, the tension never lets up, creating a sense of unease that lingers long after the credits roll.

With its visceral action sequences, powerhouse performances, and dark and brooding atmosphere, ""Sons of Anarchy"" is a must-watch for fans of gritty, no-holds-barred storytelling. With a rating of 9/10, this series stands as a testament to the power of raw emotion and unflinching realism in the world of television."
"I had withdrawals once I finished the series. Truly a great and always will be. My favorite part about this show is the rise Jax. His acting was very average seasons 1-2. Even he'll admit it was. But once you start creeping to season 3 and 4, his acting hits a speed slot. Charlie is a master of his craft, and his mastering of Jax Teller will forever go down in top 10 bad ass dudes. Another great thing about this show is the writing. It's very rare for a writer to be able to nail every single character in to which you care about them all. It's truly a GOT or Sopranos level of show. Just get ready to feel a lot of emotions from each episode. Please enjoy. You will not regret watching this."
"I feel compelled to write these comments as the stratospheric high reviews are misleading. The format and premise are promising- a modern day biker gang struggle with relationships, illegal gunrunning, competing gangs and how to walk around in a leather jacket without looking like a total idiot most of the time. Sadly, this is just a poorly written soap opera - the acting is variable and occasionally comical, the main characters are wholly unconvincing as tough MC club members (I have some knowledge of such things) and the male relationships are as homoerotic as those in Top Gun - which, lets be honest, set the benchmark in such matters. The worst aspects of this overblown nonsense is the predictability of the plots, and the by-numbers skirmishes where the whole MC crew appear to be bullet- proof and legendary combat specialists, rather than overweight drunken louts with mummy issues. Look, it has a degree of watch-ability and may pass some time on a Sunday afternoon if there's nothing else on, but the ridiculous scores of 8 plus puts this drivel in Breaking Bad territory, and I'm not having that."
"Sons of Anarchy (2008-2014)

It took me 4 months to watch the first 4 episodes of this show. Everytime I tried, I just couldn't get into it until something clicked and all of a sudden, I found myself experiencing an absolutely marvelous TV Series. Every subsequent season impressed me more and more with it's detailed level of storytelling and complex characters that go through monumental growth over the course of the journey. The show that often came to my mind was Breaking Bad so hopefully you understand the quality that I am talking about.

Sons of Anarchy is about a biker club in a small town called Charming. The bikers spend their time going about their regular lives which happen to be intertwined with all sorts of criminal activities and more often than not, these activities lead to brutal circumstances, which warrants a warning for the faint hearted. At first, they deal with small problems such as rival gangs but everytime they seem to resolve one conflict, 3 more emerge in it's place and the cycle continues in each season.

When I looked at the poster, I wondered why are members of the same club fighting? Soon enough, I realized that while external threats bring their share of troubles, the amount of internal intrigues create far more tension. The level of scheming along with the amount of shocking moments provides plenty of thrilling content that never fails to surprise. Every character brings something unique to the table and as soon as you begin to connect with them, you will come to deeply love some and hate the others.

At first glance, a biker show might seem like it is centred around men but the women play a huge part in the story as they weave their own webs much like Cersei in Game of Thrones. What makes this series effective and keeps the ride interesting is the great writing, the realistic dialogue and the raw emotions. I thought that a biker show would never interest me but I ended up experiencing an unforgettable journey full of passion, intrigue and heartbreak that has earned a place among my favorite TV shows.

P. S. A separate mention must go out to the exceptional music that not only fit the atmosphere but found a way into my heart."
"Only a few shows get stuck in your mind for quite some time after you finish watching them. Only few shows. For me Sons of Anarchy is one of them. This is not just another show about a ruthless lawless biker gang, but it is a show about ruthless moral filled biker gangs who are well aware of the rights and wrongs of society and human nature. Never disrespected women and always took care of their own. Kurt Sutter is a specialist in that kind of genre, ever since from The Shield. By the way, another brilliant show co-written by SOA's creator.

The music is beautiful and some of the songs are just great, along with the casting, every piece fits. Yaa we know that at the end everything always favored our title gang but that's why the series finale was written like that. No spoilers. Give this show a chance and try to stick with it till the end before giving a rating. Don't know why people judge a show by giving rating after seeing only few episodes or seasons.

Action+music+brotherhood+entertainment+drama. A good package."
"I absolutely adored ""Sons of Anarchy,"" a riveting and emotionally charged series that delves deep into the gritty world of an outlaw motorcycle club. Set in the fictional town of Charming, California, the show follows the lives and struggles of the members of the Sons of Anarchy Motorcycle Club Redwood Original (SAMCRO).

At the heart of the series is Jackson ""Jax"" Teller, portrayed by Charlie Hunnam, who grapples with his loyalty to the club and his desire for a better life for his family. The complexity of Jax's character mirrors the moral gray areas that the club often finds itself in. As SAMCRO navigates the dangerous underworld of organized crime, the series masterfully explores themes of loyalty, power, family, and the blurred lines between right and wrong.

The intricate web of characters, each with their own motivations and demons, adds depth and authenticity to the narrative. The relationships between the members of SAMCRO are at the core of the show, as they face internal conflicts, betrayals, and alliances that test their bonds.

The show also excels in depicting the raw and unfiltered portrayal of violence, brotherhood, and the challenges of maintaining a criminal empire. The balance between action-packed sequences and character-driven moments creates a captivating dynamic that keeps viewers invested from start to finish.

What sets ""Sons of Anarchy"" apart is its ability to elicit a wide range of emotions. From heart-wrenching tragedies to heartwarming moments of camaraderie, the series captures the complexity of human emotions and relationships. As the characters grapple with the consequences of their choices, the audience is taken on a rollercoaster ride of emotions that resonates long after the show ends.

In conclusion, ""Sons of Anarchy"" is a tour de force in storytelling, characterized by its compelling characters, intricate plotlines, and exploration of morally gray areas. It's a series that skillfully balances intense action, drama, and emotional depth, leaving a lasting impact on those who journey through the highs and lows of the SAMCRO world."
"Son's of Anarchy premiered before its time. Breaking bad was a show that much like Game of Thrones created the interest in tv beyond the cookie cutter crime shows on local networks. Shows like The Sopranos and Dexter paved the road, and Breaking Bad with Game of Thrones traveled it making it famous. Unfortunately during that same time Sons of Anarchy was also trying to make a name for itself. While tales of knights and a science teacher gone rouge were, on paper, more relatable and comforting in therms of a story, Sons of Anarchy creates a relatable feeling deeply rooted inside of audiences that plays on the ""what if I was an outlaw"" idea instead of the ""what if a normal daily life went off the rails"" such as Breaking Bad or the comfortable medieval story with and adult spin that Game of Thrones has. Due to this, it was largely overlooked because the world wasn't ready to dive into the darker inner outlaw inside themselves quite yet. However, if it was released exactly the same in today's world of 2020, the woke media would hate it because of the controversial realism the show brings to light of the world in which outlaw bikers live in. It's not for the faint of heart. It's not for everyone. It is also severely underrated."
"When ""Spongebob Squarepants"" first started, I was one of those who watched it religiously. I absolutely loved it, and thought it was the best animated show on Nickelodean. I loved the fact it was funny, creative and original. It was vibrantly animated, with lavish colouring and convincing character features. The theme tune, what can I say? Probably the catchiest theme tune out of the shows airing on Nicolodean now. The writing was witty, funny and even intelligent, and the characters were endearing, from Spongebob himself, cynical Squidward, Eugene H. Karbs and the hilarious Patrick. And the voice acting was well done.

So why did I not give it a higher score? Like ""Rugrats"" and ""The Simpsons"" the newer episodes don't work. They aren't as funny or as creative in terms of written quality as the older episodes,relying too much on toilet humour, and the voice acting sometimes is lazy, Patrick in particular now seems bored and world weary now. And Spongebob, the voice is way too high. The episode ideas aren't as original or as well thought out, in fact they are rather predictable and unrealistic. The animation and the theme tune are pretty much the only things that make the newer episodes remotely watchable. All in all, I do really like this show, for the sense of fun and creativity it has, but I just wish the newer episodes weren't as tired. 7/10 Bethany Cox"
"SpongeBob is a very popular show. Its quirky humor, colorful characters, and crazy plot lines make it irresistible. It's hard to avoid this show, even if you're an adult, or a teen. This show also cheers you up very easily. You may like it, or you may not believe that you're watching something like this, but either way, it will somehow get to you.

The story lines are focused around SpongeBob, an energetic sea sponge who lives in a pineapple under the sea. Each episode focuses around him and his misadventures with other people in his town known as Bikini Bottom. His best friend is the dopey starfish Patrick, his other best friend is the land squirrel who lives in a submarine home, Sandy. Other characters in the show are SpongeBob's drowsy neighbor, Squidward, his boss at work, Mr. Krabs, the evil Plankton, and the driving school teacher Mrs. Puff. There are a bunch of other characters in the show, but most episodes are focused around them.

These days, Nickelodeon hasn't been doing so well. Most of their new shows are spin offs of old shows, and most of the new shows aren't good at all. SpongeBob is very reminiscent of older Nickelodeon shows. Elements like quirky humor, annoying neighbors, fun plot lines, slightly dark humor in a few episodes(not as much as the old Nickelodeon shows), mishaps at work, worst enemies, and mishaps due to SpongeBob's antics all make this show great. There are times when this show can become stupid, as a matter of fact, every episode uses stupidity in a certain way. Some episodes are smartly written, and in odd ways, certain episodes have a message in them.

There is nothing in this show that should make parents feel uncomfortable. In most episodes, there is some type of adult humor that adults and teens will find to be funny.

Everyone should see this show. Watch it with kids, or by yourself, either way, you'll probably have a great time with this show."
"While the first 3 seasons are the best with the most well-crafted and well-written humor, the creators of this series and the production team are geniuses. This show is just flat out really freaking funny. While Patrick and Squidward give me great laughs and while I can probably identify as Squidward the most, Mr. Krabs and Plankton are my favorite characters. Idc if that's a controversial opinion!"
Seasons 1-3 and a little bit of 4 are masterpieces of television history.
"I'm a junior in college, and I can't help but flipping to Spongebob every saturday morning at work. This cartoon series is a work of art! It's a hilarious journey into the world of Spongebob Squarepants and his friends, a mentally challenged starfish named Patrick, a miserly 70's reject squid, Squidward, and Sandy, some sort of tripped up Squirrel who lives underwater via an air-suit.

The humor is hilarious, and as a college student, I can't stop laughing!"
"I'm 15 years old, I have a cousin who is 5 years old, and my mom is over 40. What do we all have in common? We like SpongeBob! A show that is for all ages. SpongeBob is a silly cartoon that reaches young, old, and in between. Younger kids will enjoy the silly antics and slapstick. While teens and adults will enjoy a lot of adult and more witty humor that passes over little kids heads.

The show takes place underwater. The main character, SpongeBob, is a talking sponge, who works as a fry cook for Mr. Krabs, the greedy owner of the Krusty Krab. He also works with his depressing and more sophisticated next door neighbor, Squidword Tentacles, who is constantly annoyed by SpongeBob's crazy, stupid antics. SpongeBob's other neighbor and long-life best friend, Patrick Star, is a talking pink starfish that maybe the most stupid character ever. There is also Plankton, a tiny but evil character that is jealous of Mr. Krab's restaurant and always is trying to steal his formula for the sacred Krabby Patty, but he always ends up failing miserably. Then there is Sandy Cheeks, a squirrel that for some reason lives underwater in a space-suit. Sandy befriends SpongeBob and Patrick and loves to do exciting things with them. are these not the most ridiculous characters.

You might be thinking, this sounds stupid. Well it is stupid, thats the beauty of the show. The premise is so ridiculous that anything can happen. None of the episodes ever continue the story and plot of the previous episode. Its a cartoon. Every new episode starts a new story. And the story lines of the episodes are just sometimes ridiculous, but the characters in the show are so good that everything works. Squidword is a great straight-man for the comedy. He seems to hate his life because SpongeBob and Patrick are constantly ruining things for him. Not on purpose, SpongeBob and Patrick are just stupid. Especially Patrick who is my favorite character. The show at times seems to make a point on how stupid he really is. Sometimes Patrick seems mentally retarded. But he is good at heart along with SpongeBob. Mr. Krabs on the other hand is just plain greedy. His character amuses me because he is so cheap that its ridiculous. He'll do anything to save a dollar or make an extra penny. And Plankton is the worst one of them all. Plankton comes up with these Genius plans to steal the Krabby Patty formula but he has one problem, he is an 8th of the size of everyone else. all of these characters make for great comedy.

There is stupid comedy in SpongeBob, but there is also a lot of jokes and situations that only adults can understand. There is dark humor and even some witty jokes. Sometimes you will even see some references to pop-culture events. Kids will enjoy the silly stuff when adults and teens will enjoy some of the other jokes.

This cartoon is unique because its a kids cartoon but all the main characters are full-grown adults. Yes there sea creatures but they are grown-ups. But SpongeBob and Patrick act like little kids. Thats what I find charming about the show.

Watch SpongeBob Squarepants! Any age can find humor in the show."
"My daughter 1,5 years love this show as much as i and my oldest son 21+ and even my dad used to watch it. Its for everyone.. i can watch it for hours on a rainy day. There's not an unlikeable character in this masterpiece of a cartoon and the swedish dub is good to so the whole family can watch it together. Pure lightfull fun and excellent animations and the comedy is both for old and young people. Its a 10 out of 10 for me. Im also a fan of South park and other comedy type of cartoons but sometimes a South Park episode can grow old and less funny.. but spoongebob never grows old , its a timeless show. I really recommend that you watch this show with your kids or grandparents it will put a smile on a sad face, i promise you that."
"My stepdaughter introduced me to this series, and I have to say not since Rocky and Bullwinkle have I seen a cartoon that both kids and adults can greatly enjoy and find humorous on their respective levels. My favorites include ""Survival of the Idiots"" in which Patrick and Spongebob get trapped in Sandy's treedome during her hibernation. The creator of this show has obviously befriended a Texan or two. Anyone who has owned or been owned by a cat will enjoy ""Dumped"" and ""Gary Takes a Bath"", both of which deal with Spongebob and Gary, his pet Snail. ""Grandma's Kisses"" has some of the most memorable quotes in which Patrick assures Spongebob that being a man consists of doing three things: Patrick: Allow me to demonstrate. First, puff out your chest.

(SpongeBob puffs out his chest) Patrick: Now say, ""tax exemption."" SpongeBob: Tax exemption.

Patrick: Now you must develop a taste for free-form jazz.

In ""Squidville"" well-deserved fun is poked at the dull uniformity of planned communities and homeowners associations...Anyone who lives in the DC area knows EXACTLY what I am talking about! Another classic is ""Bubble Buddy"", in which Spongebob has an imaginary friend who has been causing problems around Bikini Bottom all day. In Squidward's case his tragedy is that Bubble Buddy ""forced him to provide excellent customer service"". Anybody out there who has worked for a living will recognize Squidward as the fellow employee who wants to do the required minimum because he believes he is somehow destined for greater things.

In short, if you want something that both you and the kids can watch and truly enjoy together, you can't do any better than SpongeBob, in particular the seasons where creator Steven Hillenburg was involved."
"In it's peak first three seasons this show is a jolly trip through surrealism and relatable adult humor that really passed by all of our heads as we grew up. At it's current state it's not bad, though rarely does it ever fall back into that fantastic form that the first three seasons kept up.

It's not a bad show though, occasionally it's too surreal and oddball and obscene but nothing involving the show is ever offensively bad, excuse the rare episode. It's slapstick that kinda falls too deep into the violent and vicious side of slapstick. I admire how courageous it is at trying to make itself really stand out at times. It deserves its long lasting life, and I don't mind seeing it run till the world ends."
"I admit that years ago, I wasn't too eager to be a fan of ""SpongeBob Squarepants"". It was at the time I saw an episode called ""Survival Of The Idiots"" that I got hooked on the show. In its first three seasons, SpongeBob was one of the greatest cartoons of all time. We get a lot of nice characters with interesting personalities and tons of great gags and jokes to go along with it. The series was originally going to end after three seasons and after that, creator Stephen Hillenberg left. For the longest time, there weren't any episodes people considered their favorites made in the show for years.

I stopped watching the show after the fourth season and pretty much stopped watching Nickelodeon after that. With Cartoon Network being obsessed with ""Teen Titans Go!"", I came back to this network if only to watch new great cartoons like ""The Loud House"". I kept hearing horror stories about new SpongeBob episodes where the characters became little more than shells of their former selves, doomed to have the same single personality trait for the rest of the run. I did watch the new SpongeBob movie and am very glad to find out Hillenberg went back to the show.

I've seen newer episodes and they really are a big improvement from when he wasn't there. Hillenberg didn't want the show to go on forever so they continued it without him. I really don't know his exact thoughts on the series now but he has come back and episodes are getting good. I'm glad to say I'm back to watching SpongeBob after many years. Looking here on the IMDb, it saddened me to see new reviews where everyone says the show has declined, but it has gotten good again.

What can I really say? This show has had some of the best lines and scenarios in any animated show ever. It's weird looking back and seeing as how newer cartoons like ""Gravity Falls"" and ""My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic"" have revolutionized entertainment as we know it. This was still a great show for its day and has really gotten better. We don't want to see our favorite characters become caricatures and they have in fact grown out of them. I'm glad to say we're back on track not just for the show, but Nickelodeon in general. ****"
"Been a Spongebob Squarepants fan since 1999, and quite frankly, I am very disappointed of how much this show has changed over the years.

Here's a brief summery of it:

Season 1 (1999–2000) — The early classic episode years: When the show first started, it wasn't bad. Yes, there was less humor, and the stories were slower-paced, but they were strong stories, and (crucially) the characters were funny, likable, and identifiable. (Despite being roughly drawn.)

Seasons 2 and 3 (2000–2004) — The later classic episode years: Pretty much all Spongebob fans would agree that you can't get better than these years. The writing team was at its absolute best and the stories were all fresh. Most, if not all, of the greatest episodes came from this period (""Band Geeks"" ""Chocolate With Nuts"", ""Wet Painters"", etc). In these days there was no such thing as a bad episode. There wasn't a single episode that did not make you laugh non-stop for 11 minutes.

Seasons 4–5 (2005–2007) — The poor episode years: Season 4 marked the beginning of the gradual decline of Spongebob Squarepants. It was the first ever season to have bad episodes. Yes, there were still some goodies (such as ""Skill Crane"" or ""Krusty Towers"") but some really poor ones were there in the mix, too (""Good Neighbors"", ""Funny Pants"", ""All That Glitters"", and — worst of all — ""Karate Island""). And by season 5 (when most of the original writing team had left), we had episodes that weren't just poor, they felt like a completely different TV show. (Episodes such as ""Ghost Host"", ""SpongeHenge"", ""Banned in Bikini Bottom"", etc). We were all thinking that the show was going through a rough patch, but this was only the beginning of what was yet to come

Seasons 6–now (2008–present) — The crap episode years: Ever since seasons 4–5, Spongebob Squarepants episodes had always been somewhere between excellent and occasionally poor. Then, in season 6, they began making absolute crap. The Spongebob as we've known and loved was all but dead. Some of the worst offenders were: ""The Splinter"", ""Professor Squidward"", ""Pets or Pests"", ""Dear Vikings"", and many others. But probably the one moment when every Spongebob fan realized — for certain — it was no longer the same show, was when Mr. Krabs becomes obsessed over a penny that SpongeBob finds in ""Penny Foolish"". This episode had absolutely no humor or plot. It concluded with Mr. Krabs selling out thousands of dollars he had just to receive one darn penny. The writers might as well of had him selling out the entire show's fanbase, while at it. From here on, the crap episodes just kept coming more and more and these days you can go almost an entire season without finding a good one.

So in conclusion, I'm rating the show 5 stars for the first 3 seasons and the semi-decent 4-5 Seasons. However, I can't give the more recent episodes even the slightest praise."
"Spongebob Squarepants"" (1999) TV Series

It seems that it wasn't long ago that this show aired on Nickelodeon, but it's been like 5 years, and Spongebob Squarepants' popularity hasn't decreased at all- of course, I can see why. This show is set in the small town of Bikini Bottom (a town under the sea that is home to many sea worthy creatures)- including a spontaneous sponge named Spongebob. He lives with his pet snail, Gary, next to two neighbors- a grumpy clarinet playing octopus- Squidward, and his best friend who is a starfish who couldn't tell his hand from his foot- named Patrick. He also has a friend who lives in an air dome, and she's a Texas native squirrel named Sandy, who got bored with life above water, so she moved to the ocean. Spongebob works at the Krusty Krab along with Squidward, a popular restaurant owned by the greedy Mr. Krabbs. And there is Plankton- a microscopic sea creature who owns his own restaurant- The Chum Bucket- a very unpopular restaurant, that hasn't gotten a customer since it's opening- so, of course, Plankton is always out to steal Mr. Krabbs' secret Krabby Patty formula, causing trouble for the krusty krew. Spongebob goes through one predicament after another, and this show is just hilarious. Some may find Spongebob annoying, but for those like me, we love him! 10/10."
"Overall, I liked this show and loved it as a young child back at the 90s when it was first released on nickelodeon. The first three seasons were amazing with some creative plot lines for each episode (not to mention the funny and witty humor/jokes) and also revolves around every situation my favorite characters are going through and are handled quite well throughout the show. The animation is pretty with fluid backgrounds and brilliant character designs. The characters are likable and timeless as ever. Spongebob and Patrick are dumb, but smart and Squidward is mean, but also likable, Mr. Krabs is funny and Plankton is evil and also funny. Even the new characters in the first three seasons are great and executed the show perfectly with some talented voice actors like Tom Kenny, Clancy Brown and others.

Then, in 2006, two years after the release of it's first feature length film, ""The Spongebob Squarepants Movie"", the show started to go downhill with seasons 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9 with the story lines being the same and the majority of those seasons now becomes repetitive. The characters have ranged from likable to very irritating and the pacing is too damn awful! The new episodes started to make me cringe as I wished the show would've just ended with season 3, but nope. Instead, the writers decided to give up and started to continue the franchise as it becomes to get quite boring and predictable which resulted in destroying a great reminder of my childhood!

If you watch the first three seasons that reminded you of your childhood instead of the later ones, then you are welcome to for this is one of the greatest shows in television history."
"Seasons 5-8 is freaking terrible it's like teen titans go but Nickelodeon, I only like only 2 episodes from that time but season 09-present is a 100times improvement and is great but not gold. Seasons 1-4 is the best show ever."
"Spongebob's one of those shows that everyone knows. the reason why it's like that is because spongebob's appeal seems to be very diverse coming from children to adults. it's jokes are clever and the chemistry of the characters are marvelous. the random humor is ingenious as most random humor seems to be very plain. from slapstick to complex innuendoes, the humor can be enjoyed by all its viewers and definitely becomes nostalgic with many other elements that make this series great. thank you, stephen hillenburg for making one of the greatest animated series of all time."
Spongebob is a great show in my childhood. So much fun and funny and enjoyable and amazing. Thank you stephen hillenburg for created this great show. I hope you always happy.
Spongebob was great and funny show in first 4 season. But now it is boring and so stupid and bad.i really miss old spongebob.
"The first 5 seasons of SpongeBob SquarePants is a masterpiece and I highly recommend it.

The pre-movie seasons (1-3), of course it's a masterpiece as mentioned by many, but most(?) people doesn't really talk about (or like) the seasons after it since Stephen left iirc. Season 4 and 5 probably has slightly worse writing, but what's good is that mostly there wasn't a single boring episode. It was more fast-paced with more action, and it managed to be somewhat consistent, which made it as good (almost even better) as the first 3 seasons for me.

Season 6 was just fine, it was starting to get bad but it was still watchable. Season 7 however, is where it actually fell off and made me stop watching (even the parents guide mention it being depressing).

I will probably give the future seasons a try someday, but for now you can watch the first 5 seasons of SpongeBob for a really good time :)"
Who doesn't love that adorable sponge? That show is unbelievably funny. Some people don't like it and that's their opinions! I think spongebob squarepants is a great show.
"If the animation and style stayed like they were from season 1 to 9 this could have been an easy 10, but new seasons are overly childish and stupid and there's no point in watching anymore..."
"Spongebob Squarepants used to be Nikelodeaen's signature series. All the characters were good and the plot lines had meaning, and the show had talent. Nickelodean said in 1999 (when the show was created) that they would do three seasons and then do the movie. and that was it. until after the movie in 2004 the show boomed with popularity. so nickelodeon renewed the show for a forth season. After the movie, series creator and creative writer Stepen Hillenburg basically left the show and Paul Tibbit basically took over everything. This is when the show started going down hill. Then more rookie writers were hired and gave the plot lines dry, stupid humor. Everything that the first three seasons and the movie had set in stone was then defied and questioned in the past three seasons. all the characters have just became stupid. Spongebob has become high-pitched and annoying. Patrick is just oblivious to anything, now. Sandy is too smart and is overused. Mr. Krabs has become TOO cheap and his cheapness has been reused in too many episodes. Squidward has become too sarcastic and obsessed with himself. TOO many plot lines involving Plankton trying to steal the Krabby Patty formula. Spongebob has just become a whiny baby. If people thought he was gay when he came out, they should look at him now! It isn't funny any more. All of the plot lines are extremely predictable.(Plankton tries to steal the Krabby Patty formula, Mr. Krabs pinches a penny, Spongebob cries.) Nickelodeon is just bleeding this show dry, such as what FOX is doing with the Simpson's. They know people will continue watching it and they will keep on bringing in the MONEY. They will sponge off of this show for as long as they can.(pun intended) The show used to be for adults and kids alike, now it should be put on Nick Jr with Dora and Deiago. I would have given this show a ten star rating for seasons 1-3 and the movie. Now a one. I 100% recommend seasons 1-3 and the movie(especially season 1) Spongebob used to be the Coupe De Ville of Nickelodean, know it's just like the rest of the shows nick is limping out to the barn with.(Mighty B, Penguins of Madagascar, Back at the Baryard.)"
"Krysten Ritter was absolutely fantastic as Jessica Jones! And as great as she was, Rachael Taylor was equally as bad as Trish Walker. I was rooting for her character to die throughout the entire series! Overall, Jessica Jones is a really good tv show and while it's not quite as good as ""The Punisher"" or ""Daredevil"", it's still good and absolutely worth watching! Anyway, this is so much more than just a Superhero show, it's an intense psychological drama that is incredibly well written. Kilgrave (David Tennant) is one of the best bad guys in any Superhero movie or tv show ever. He's not the best but he's up there. It may start a little slow for some but stick with it because I promise it gets better. All 3 seasons are great!"
"As a huge fan of Marvel I'm a little biased because I pretty much like everything they put out. My bias aside, Jessica Jones is terrific! If you don't believe me just read through the reviews here and look at the ratings. Even the critics loved this. Krysten Ritter was born to play Jessica Jones. She is easily the best part of the show. This is a show that you'll want to binge as quickly as you can, it's that good. It's too bad that Netflix couldn't renew their contracts with Marvel and they had to stop making the Netflix Marvel shows because every single one of them was great! Now that they're on Disney they can bring these wonderful characters back. They already started to with Daredevil and Kingpin and just renewed Daredevil for another season. Now they have to do the same for The Punisher, Luke Cage and Jessica Jones. At least bring them back into the MCU somehow. If you're a Marvel fan then this is a must watch!"
"So, the Marvel/Netflix alliance ends here, not with a bang, but with a bit of a whimper.

Jessica Jones (Kristen Ritter) is a Private Investigator, a functioning alcoholic and a misanthrope. She's also, thanks to some illegal experimentation, unworldly strong, resilient and tough. She struggles with the responsibility that comes with being ""powerered"" and is haunted by death of her family, which occurred in a traffic accident years prior.

The first season of Jessica Jones was excellent. Mostly because, unlike some other seasons of both this show, and the others in the extended universe, it had an excellent and charismatic villain in David Tennent's Kilgrave. Without having the same levels of action set pieces, this first season still is as good as anything that ""Daredevil"" or ""Punisher"" could produce. The season also introduced us to Luke Cage, which then spun into his own series and Mike Coulters chemistry with Ritter is excellent.

Unfortunately, unlike ""Daredevil"", there was a pronounced drop off in quality for the second season, and that run had a dull villain from Jessica's past played by Janet McTeer. Drifting away from the private eye type story and into more soap elements didn't help this run either. We also started to spend even more time with the shows supporting characters, such as Jeri Hogarth played by Carrie-Anne Moss. Though she was great, the show feels watered down when we're spending time with these characters and it's not related directly to what's happening to Jessica. The second and third seasons also suffer from the ""Netflix"" problem of making 13 episodes, when you have enough story for 8, so plot points are hit over and over again.

The third season is better though. Jessica is back with a case to solve involving a Serial Killer played by Jeremy Bobb. There's more action and intrigue, although it still doesn't match the heights of the first season. It would be easy to see why their hearts wouldn't be in this run, as the cancellations were announced long before this was released.

Overall, I feel like the first season of this is ""must see"" but the remaining two aren't essential. The show isn't as consistent as ""Daredevil"" but is generally a cut above ""Iron Fist"" and ""Luke Cage""."
"When we first meet private investigator Jessica Jones(Ritter, snark personified), she's a recovering rape survivor. She has PTSD, as we see from the coping mechanism of naming her childhood home's streets, and her symptoms. These include trouble falling asleep, and even when she does, such as on the subway(which gives you an Idea of how badly she needs to rest. The smell and noise of it alone seems like it should be enough that you could never catch Zs, not to mention how many people around you don't trust being vulnerable near) she almost immediately comes to. The reason for this is simple. Whenever she starts to lose consciousness, immediately it feels like her abuser is right behind her, whispering in her ear, licking her(!). Her trauma is taken seriously, and it's put front and center.

That man is Kilgrave(Tennant, making a meal of it). He literally does not have empathy, and it is explained why. His power? Others have to do anything he says, which basically means that he can either get everything he wants, or he can carefully think about every word that comes out of his mouth. You can probably guess which he chooses. An emotionally stunted narcissist, he literally can compel others to fulfill his lightest whim. And he claims to actually love our PI, and want her to be happy. He carries out what he believes are grand romantic gestures. Not seeming to understand that while he apparently did think of her as someone that he wants to spend the rest of his life with, she wants nothing more to do with him. She was his prisoner. And if he legitimately wanted to know if she felt the same, all he had to do is tell her she had to be truthful, and ask. And yet he didn't. Maybe he knew the answer. Perhaps it was just too big of a risk to take. Either way, it ended up with him forcing her. In reality, there are no people who can force *anyone* they talk to, to do what they want, Make them think they want it, make them go along against their better judgement. But there are lots who can do that with a select few. It's called gaslighting, and it's something we need to put a stop to.

She's not alone in fighting him. Her adoptive sister, former child star and current radio personality Trish Walker(Taylor, spot-on). She used to be known as the titular star of kid's show ""It's Patsy"", which is also how a lot of people greet her when they recognise her. Every so often, we'll get another titbit of it, like hearing the theme song, sitting in on the tail end of a table read, hearing someone describe one of the plots. They really got it exactly right. I know that I watched stuff just like it when I was growing up. She's a lot more stable and dependable, at least these days. She definitely wasn't always, and we will see her struggle. She feels a strong drive to make the world a better place, and may not always feel like she is doing enough for that.

Add to that, next door neighbor Malcolm Ducasse(Darville, exactly right) starts out addicted to drugs. Occasionally, he needs minor assistance, he gets it, and that's basically it. At first, people don't really think much of him. And neither does the audience. Which makes for a very effective turn when he quits cold turkey And becomes sober. He becomes a full person in our mind - as he in reality of course always was. We just didn't look past the veneer. It forces us to confront that maybe we Accidentally did this in real life as well. This also greatly encourages empathy for sex workers, the unhoused and ethnic minorities. It has a lot of emotional intelligence in discussing these immensely relevant issues. And it manages to make everyone complex.

Someone she sometimes works with, without either of them particularly liking the other(It is very much a case of mutual respect for the other's abilities and intense distaste for personal choices), is Jeri Hogarth(Moss, impeccable). She's a lawyer who worked hard to get to the top, And we watch as her life starts to come apart around her. On a show full of trainwrecks who make lousy decisions that end up hurting themselves, she may well be the one who has made the most mistakes and stands to lose the most. It would be easy for this to devolve into finger pointing, so it's very impressive that it never does. After she grew up poor and bullied, she put immense effort into gaining and maintaining complete control of the circumstances of her life, and most of the problems she faces are specifically because of selfish choices rather than things that she simply couldn't do anything about. Hers is a tragedy of fighting to escape one extreme only to end up at another.

This is a noir story. That means that it has shadows, silhouettes(well, a lot of the time, the cinematography is not that adventurous), sax music, investigative work, conspiracy and corruption. When it features sex, it isn't shot in male gaze(in fact, occasionally, it will be distinctly female, with a focus on fingers and lips, rather than legs and curves), it isn't there just for titillation, it establishes and grows characters and their interpersonal relationships. There is a distinct effort made to avoid anyone on this coming across as disposable, and it rarely fails. This was shot on location in New York and it adds a lot of texture. Essentially, the only criticism I have is the pacing. Like the other Netflix shows, each season is mandated to be 13 episodes and they just don't have the right amount of story for that.

This features bloody, gory, graphic violence, disturbing content, and strong language. I recommend it to any fan of complex narratives. 9/10."
Really entertaining show. Only let down by the occasional face palm moment here and there. David Tennant is wonderful and adds a much needed touch of class to proceedings. Carrie Ann Moss is also very good. Other performances are...hit and miss. Overall a solid - if occasionally dopey - show.
"Season 1 - 10/10

Season 2 - 5/10

Season 3 - 6/10.

Krysten Ritter is amazing as JJ.

Kilgrave is an awesome antagonist portrayed by an awesome actor.

This is my short and concise review to save you time.

EnJoy!"
"I am truly baffled by the negative reviews. This show is incredible. Every character is truly fascinating and we get glimpses of their back stories to supplement the story, but I guess people are disappointed that not everything was revealed immediately? I am almost positive that the mystery of Jessica Jones' background is intentional and they will reveal more as the show develops. As for people that complain that the show is boring....these must be the people keeping things like the Transformers series in business. If you're looking for constant explosions and action, you'll be disappointed. However, if you are looking for a show with well developed characters, a chilling villain, a compelling and relatable main character, an intriguing storyline, and just utterly spectacular acting, this is the show for you. No, it's not a typical superhero show. It goes above and beyond in so many aspects. This has raised the bar for superhero stories, in my opinion. Krysten Ritter is superb and very believable as Jessica Jones. I love love love this show! Give it a chance, you will not be sorry you did! I can't wait for Season 2."
"If for nothing else, watch Jessica Jones for David Tennant's performance as Kilgrave. He is better than any other Marvel movie or TV villain ever seen before. He is truly terrifying but oddly hypnotizing. He can make you do whatever he tells you to. Not only does David Tennant's charisma make this believable, but the writers use it in a lot of cool ways. As a villain, he's right up there with Heath Ledger's Joker.

Krysten Ritter (Jesse's girlfriend from season 2 of Breaking Bad) plays the lead. It's great to see a Female Marvel lead, and she delivers a wonderfully understated performance. The show starts off as a gritty detective show with dry humour and not much of Tennant. However, as the show goes along, it evolves into something much cooler. It gets darker but also funnier, and Tennant's involvement becomes larger.

In conclusion, Jessica Jones is a very binge-able show with a memorable villain and a great lead that doesn't need much prior knowledge despite tying into the Marvel universe. In my opinion, it's even better than Daredevil."
"This is just a general review of what I felt overall having just finished the finale.

The first season was brilliant, 8/10. If you haven't watched JJ then just watch S1.

The second season was rubbish and so was the third, 5-6/10. Hence I downgraded my overall rating from 8/10 to 7/10.

Trish Walker was such a lame character and the fact that she features more prominently in the plot for S2 and S3 probably explains part of why the show went downhill.

S3 was the end for the show just in the same way as Daredevil which itself was a brilliant show and didn't really dip the way JJ did (blame Netflix/Disney).

JJ for the average viewer can feel like a bit of a drag so bare that in mind, but again it's worth it in S1 as the whole premise is she's a private investigator dealing with a bad guy/girl over the series."
"If you're considering watching this show, chances are you've already watched Marvel's Daredevil and know what to expect: a darker, grittier tone than the rest of the Marvel universe, great production values and strong characterization. It delivers all those things and more.

Jessica Jones tells the story of a retired superhero, a woman who tried to help and failed. Jessica is a broken character; she suffers from PTSD, has nightmares and constant flashbacks and drinks a lot. She's an incredibly compelling protagonist; flawed but strong, broken but fighting, sad but with a sarcastic edge that makes her funny and easy to love.

The show isn't afraid to explore dark themes of sexual assault, rape and abortion and it does so with taste. The victims are not shown being raped; the viewer is just expected to believe them without titillating rape scenes to prove the facts.

As a survivor herself, Jessica shows both the signs of her trauma and the will to fight back. Women in Jessica Jones suffer, they fail, but they fight.

Unlike Daredevil's Kingpin, Killgrave is a threat from the first episode which results is better pacing (Daredevil took 4 episodes to find its feet in my opinion). Because of Jessica's PTSD, you constantly feel his shadow and the tension is constant. The show doesn't waste time with an origin story or training sequences; it takes you straight into the action and doesn't let you go.

A definite success for Marvel."
"This review pains me to write, because I genuinely think that Season 1 was the pinnacle of serialized television. It had amazing plotting, a satisfying ending, a terrifying villain, characters that I loved, nothing superfluous, beautiful cinematography and tone. It delivered on every promise that it made.

I could not wait for Season 2. And those two years were tough. Alas it finally arrived. I knew going in that it had a tough act to follow and so I made a concerted effort to judge it on it's own merits and not to dismiss it just for failing to achieve the impossible by living up to the first.

What went wrong. Plotting: All over the place with little focus. A terrifying villain? Try NO villain. Characters that I love? Yes but the two leads are mostly kept separate from each other for some strange reason. Nothing superfluous? Carrie Ann Moss and her entire sub-plot was boring and irrelevant. Jessica's rival PI was a flat plot device. A satisfying ending? I wouldn't know, I couldn't get past episode 8. It was putting me to sleep. The season did continue to have beautiful cinematography and tone/atmosphere, but that gets no points from me if the writing is dull. Nutmeg can make good egg nog great, but it's not appetizing when eaten on it's own.

I think the biggest problem with Season 2 is that it fails to deliver on Jessica Jones' core promise: it is a sci-fi super-hero show about a tortured loner who does not want to be a superhero but is, none-the-less, forced to fight super-villains because they are threatening her and the people she loves.

In other words, Season 2 was Jurassic Park without Dinosaurs.

I'm giving the show a 5. A perfect 10 for the first season, and a 0 for the second."
"Much like Daredevil, the real saga of Jessica Jones is that of the Villain. David Tennant shines as a dark and broken sociopath. His performance is chilling and terrifying and asks dark questions about what we would do with ultimate power over those around us, and about what would become of us.

Stepping past Tennant's breathtaking performance, the rest of the casting is apt and on point. Any fan of the comic books will be hard pressed to fault Jessica Jones or Luke Cage. Their chemistry and dynamic is ink made flesh and the characters that we loved brought to screen. The supporting cast are equally brilliant, especially the trio of Australian actors supporting in the roles of Trish Walker, Will Simpson and Malcolm. Comic book buffs will quickly spot the nods to comic cannon and the fascinating divergence and rebirth of comic book icons. There is extensive dialogue and set references to comic book icons that shows a phenomenal attention to detail that becomes a love letter to long term fans of these properties.

Jessica Jones breathes yet more life into the promise of the Defenders franchise at Netflix. Bring on Luke Cage, Iron Fist, and future seasons. If for some reason you haven't yet signed up for Netflix - this show alone is a reason to do so."
"Jessica Jones is what happens when you strip off a superhero's spandex and explosions. Taking away the flash of Hollywood block-busters puts a great burden on both the plot and actors, and Jessica Jones excels in both.

The series is a must-see for anyone who likes a good thriller. Rather than using superpowers or alien gadgets, the main character's search for the villain is good old-fashioned PI work. The superpower that has the most relevance to the plot, mind-control of the wonderfully evil villain Kilgrave played by David Tennant, is not used in a quest to destroy the world but rather to pose difficult ethical questions: What would you do if you had the ultimate power? Who can be redeemed?

13 episodes leaves no time for fillers, keeping the plot moving fast. The cinematography is also great."
"Krysten Ritter is one of my favourite actresses, she never ceases to surprise me with her talent. Jessica Jones is one of the TV shows that I have become addicted to. The way Ritter has portrayed her character has brought the superhero to life. I can not think of anyone else that would suit this role more than Krysten."
"Tennant as villain is the real star of this show. This show, dripping in woke tropes, can't really get over it's show runners unusual bent in order to tell a decent story. Should have stuck closer to the source material."
"First and third season are both very good. Second season is a little below par. But generally the writing, the characters and the action scenes are just better than the others (although i did like Iron Fist to, unlike most). The villains in season 1 and 3 are also very good. I really hated them and that makes you more invested. I also think the humour is better in this show. Especially in season 1.

One thing i am a little tired of from these shows though, is the tendency to make the so called hero run around and protect the villains. That is so annoying. This weird philosophy they have that if you kill bad people you become a bad person yourself should be buried."
"Having enjoyed Daredevil very much I thought I would give this show a chance as well. And it does have a very similar feel to it that Daredevil had.

This show takes place in the Marvel universe but it much grittier and darker than what we saw in movies such as the Avengers.

It focuses on the character Jessica Jones who is a Private Investigator and has super-human strength. But Jessica has a dark past with the man known as Kilgrave who has a very strong interest in Jessica though she tries very hard to keep her distance from him. Unfortunately, a missing person case that she is involved in leads her straight back to Kilgrave and she is now dealing with the damage he is causing to her and her loved ones.

This show is a joy from start to finish. Around episode 6 is when things really pick up, with many twists and turns to keep you on the edge of your seat. There is enough mystery and character development mixed in with some action-packed fights to really pull you in.

The only downside, in my opinion, was that there were times it just felt like an extended chase sequence. Where they go to one location, pick up a small clue and then run to another location to pick up another clue and so on. It dragged on for a bit but was not in any way boring, but also didn't feel as fulfilling as it should have.

I enjoyed the exploration of minor characters in the series as well. People who seem to just be background noise end up taking more time than I would have expected and I thought it was brilliantly done. I began to feel bad for characters I never thought I would.

All the actors did a brilliant job. The writing was amazing.

Definitely a show worth watching."
"This is honestly great! I can't understand why some people review this series so badly.

I admit I was reluctant at first as to what my opinion of this show was and whether it was something that I could regularly follow, however I quickly warmed to it and grew to appreciate its dark tone. This darker take on a Marvel superhero makes for quite a refreshing change, since Marvel's work is more than often aimed at a child audience.

This show has a great plot which grows increasingly tense, intriguing and revealing as it progresses, and its characters are all finely crafted as likable yet unconventional heroes and David Tenant is actually quite effective as the repulsive and psychotic villain Kilgrave.

The action and effects are also consistently good, however I personally enjoyed watching this series more for its story and character development. I would definitely recommend this series and very much eagerly await its next season which this one suitably sets up in the finale."
"After 3 seasons, think I get it. This is a show about character arcs and using your brain instead of super powers (unless it's an emergency). Sounds good, but way tooooo slow. The Hogarth arc is mostly annoying to watch. Keep the pace fast and the monologues short. I could edit this down to half the episode count, and have a great show. Maybe a little ""good"" humor to balance dark Jessica wouldn't hurt either."
"If you grew up in the 90's then you were a fan of The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air! Even if you didn't, you are still probably a fan because it's just a flat out funny show. This is where Will Smith started his career, no one knew at the time he would become the actor he is today but most saw a bright future. Now, he lost his mind at the Oscars when he slapped Chris Rock and he will always be remembered for that but that still doesn't take away from the fact that he's had a great career and this was the start. I still laugh when I watch the reruns on tv just as much as I did when I was a kid watching it."
"I grew up watching The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air and still love it to this day. Everyone knows by now what it's about, it's about a street kid from Philadelphia that moves to Bel-Air to live with his rich Uncle, Aunt, cousins and their butler. I watched it so much that I still know every line of the theme song. Is a classic sitcom from the 90's. I even still watch it when it's on now. I know they just did a reboot of the series but you can't reboot a classic like this and expect it to even be half as good. The entire cast is hilarious which is led by a very young Will Smith. It's easily one of the best sitcoms from the 90's. It's one of those shows where you can watch it as much as you want and it's still funny. I'll always love this show!"
"It is already so long ago. Now Will Smith is the same age as uncle Phil was at the end of the show. And James Avery who portrayed Philip Banks is unfortunately dead. But the show itself hasn't lost it's humor and charm. I enjoyed it to the fullest rewatching it now, and actually watching it for the first time from beginning to the end.

While it was Will Smith who became the most famous after, I would say it were the other characters who made the show as wonderful as it is.

James Avery as uncle Phil was one of my favorites. It was amazing acting where he brought us both humor and emotions. I loved to see this man taking care of his nephew as his own son, help him to become a man and build such an amazing connection with him. This was all portrayed greatly. One of the reasons I would not want to see a reboot of this show is because it will never be the same without him. Alfonso Ribeiro as Carlton was also delightful. So much great comedy with this extraordinary personality and his trademark dancing. Definitely unforgettable. Joseph Marcell was an amazing Geoffrey. All this wit and sarcasm made him one of the best on the show. Karyn Parsons was a great Hilary. She made this character who was very shallow and snobby also very likable. Those are the ones who gave me the most laughter. The rest were also great addition. Vivian and Ashley were just very ordinary people, but the acting was superb.

Pretty much every story is fun and original. Even the jokes that get repeated (Carlton's height, Phil's weight etc.) don't seem to be a problem and make it look repeatable. And watching Jazz being thrown out of the house was always great fun.

Part of me wishes there were more seasons, but I am also happy that it ended at it's peak so it was great from the beginning to the end. I would tell young people who were born too late and missed it to watch it, it is still hilarious."
"Of all the shows, I believe that ""The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air"" is the one with which I can most identify with, since I have surely seen every single episode at least a dozen times - and yet it STILL never gets tired! I cannot get sick of this show, and it's making me a bit disturbed! Just what is it that makes this show so continually appealing, even around seven years since its final episode? I'm not sure...it's certainly not just one element. Every part of this show is magic: the wonderful acting from all involved; the witty (and often painfully hysterical) one-liners and banter between characters; the hip, cool atmosphere; the music...it all perfectly fits into what has to be one of the most remarkable and well-made sitcoms of the '90s.

I find myself shocked sometimes at the number of people who have totally forgotten about this show. Granted, it DID end in 1996, and obviously a lot has happened since then (most notably the skyrocketing music & film career of a certain lead star), but I mean, come on! This show is an undisputed classic! Who can forget the wild, crazy, and just plain amusing adventures we've had with Will Smith and the Banks family?

There were times when I was just addicted to this show, I remember...it was a while back when the episodes were running in syndication every evening on TBS SuperStation...I can't believe how this show can always manage to crack me up. It's incredible. I've grown to love all these characters so much, and even now, I still wouldn't pass up an opportunity to watch yet another priceless rerun.

I agree, though, that yes, a lot of the late, LATE episodes (around the second-last and final season) had their fair share of groans, and showed some glaring signs of tedium, but thankfully, the overwhelming positive qualities of the series tower over such minor flaws - including the mysterious re-casting of Aunt Vivian's role from Janet Hubert-Whitten to Daphne Maxwell Reid; the increasingly old-hat shtick of using the same stock footage whenever Jazz gets thrown out of the Banks residence for the umpteenth time; the cursed addition of a new cast member - little Nicky Banks (Ross Bagley), etc....

It's not an entirely perfect show, certainly (but then - what show is?), and it has had its fair share of ups and downs in its moderately impressive run of six years. However, when all is said and done, in the end, this show can proudly stand on its own as a pop culture treasure. It has evolved from what seemed initially to be an awkward, cheesy, quaint little '80s/'90s Cosby rip-off to a mature, slick, and fabulously written/produced/directed program. Pure gold is what this show is.

A truly underrated, and always entertaining, gem. ""The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air"" is one for the ages."
"This show is my favourite show on nick@nite. It's the only TV show that really makes me laugh. Of coarse that's only one great aspect of the show's magical touch of comedy. The acting is great and the show's characters each have their own individual and comical personality that the viewer may relate too. The storyline of the series is quite interesting. A city boy, Will Smith who was born and raised in West Philadelphia was sent to live with his rich aunt and uncle in Bel-Air.

The Fresh Prince Of Bel-Air is a show you'll never get tired of. The attitudes of each character only builds up the humour. Carlton, the geek who thinks so highly of himself. Hilary, the stuck up brat. Can't forget Geoffrey the butler with the wise Aleck attitude and many more.

All in all, The Fresh Prince Of Bel-Air is great fun and laughs for the whole family"
"Now this is the review of how i enjoyed my time watching bel air. What i loved about this was the originality behind literally everything, the cast were great at adapting to different scenes and making our childhoods awesome, the stories were great and hilarious. The relationship between Will & Uncle Phil really is a funny one, i just loved these two working together it really was an experience of stitches and aching from laughter. I used to rush home from.school to watch this on VIVA, the good ole days.

If you somehow haven't caught this yet I'd highly recommend it, start to finish!"
"OK, so I never watched this as a kid growing up. I was into manga, nickelodeon, Disney etc. However, now I am 25 i decided to go through all the TV shows I missed whilst growing up and this was one of them. Boy oh boy, I was not disappointed. Despite the last show being run over 20 years ago, this comedy is well worth the watch. Will Smith is obviously the star, but the performances by every single person in the Banks family was memorable. Some episodes were there just for the laughs, some were slower and some had serious learning reflections. The latter is what made this show stand out. Going from an episode that made me laugh to one with a serious message of gun control or racism sets this show apart from the majority of sitcoms. It was, well, a fresh experience.

One of the few gripes I had was that some of the jokes were repeated many, many times. It did start to grate on me when Will would say ""You know what I'm sayyyyyiiinnnngggg?"" in that characteristic tone. The other thing that slightly annoyed me was the re-casting of Vivian. I understand why it happened, but I just do not think the replacement was anywhere near as good.

Other than these minor points, I thoroughly enjoyed watching this show from S01E01 to S06E24. If you have not watched this show before, you should. If you have seen this show before, you probably should watch it again."
"This show is so enteraining and hip that anybody can watch it especially that Will Smith is the star of the show. He moves to Bell Air to live with his wealthy cousins and his Aunt Vivan and Uncle Phil. Karyn Parson is beautiful, wise, kinda smart, a lot of fun but a bit of a spoiled princess as Hilary, Alfanso is intelligent, cute and sweet as Carlton, James Avery is a talent as Uncle Phil, Janet Hubert is awesome, a great mom and wife and very funny, Geoffry is so full of scarcasm that he is just so funny and Tatyana Ali is such a good actress, she shines as the beautiful, smart, funny, sweet, gifted and talented as Ashley. I love this show, it's hilarious and anybody can relate to it and it's dentally a coming of age show for everybody. I give it a 10/10 rating."
"The setup: The Banks family, a respectable Californian family, take in a relative - Will Smith, a street-smart teenager from Philadelphia. The idea is to make him respectable, responsible and mature, but Will has got other plans...

The verdict: Passable '90s fun. I never laughed so hard in my life. Will's car is always getting into accidents on the way to California. After reading some of the negative reviews on here, I just have to say that some people really don't get it. It is very light-hearted and it isn't complex at all as all the characters struggle against a system that has perpetuated many falsehoods. Rerun time!"
"Best show ever. Me and my roommate catch this show every Nite on Nick at Nite.

Favorite episodes would have to be....

The one where Will and Carlton go to jail and they meet the convict who sings ""Let My People Go""

All of those episodes with the EMT,firefighter, forest ranger guy who is slow and says crazy things.

The infamous episode where Viv decides to become a dancer again, love it! Love that dance sequence at the end.

The one where they go to the séance so Hilary can talk to Trevor after he passed away (Break the hex!).

The episode where Hillary is dating Will's professor and can't get over the mole (dum dum didday...hahaha)

The episode where Carlton and Hilary find out they are dating each other (Y'all two datin'?)

The episode where Will and Lisa's dad get in the plane crash...(momenemum, hahaha).

The episode they go on the Oprah show (wow, I can hardly remember the days when Oprah used to go through the aisles talking to her audience).

The episode Will and his girlfriend get stuck in the basement during the earthquake (""Here, here, here, here, here.....""Going outta my mind, I thought she was fine, don't know if her body is hers..haha)

My goodness, I could go on and on, this was the best show they don't make sitcoms like this anymore!"
"If they still made sitcoms like 'The Fresh Prince' I would probably be glued in front of my television every night. Thankfully they don't, because I have a hard time turning the channel when Will and the Banks family are on. This is quite simply the best sitcom in the history of television. Yes, it is better than Seinfeld. It simply covers some serious elements of life, yet always makes you laugh out loud. Will Smith is brilliant and it is obvious what Hollywood saw in him that made him into such a successful movie star. The biggest compliment I can give this show is that it is absolutely timeless and I will continue to watch rerun episodes, because it is just that good."
"I primarily know ""The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air"" in its long life of reruns on ""Nick at Nite"" and TBS. I didn't necessarily watch the show in order from beginning to end. But whenever the show was on, I would stop changing channels and have a good time watching. I won't bother giving a synopsis of the show's premise because the intro to the show does a better job than I ever could. Not only does it give you the set up, it also gives you a good idea of the tone of the show you're going to watch. It is both childishly innocent, but mature and never feels like it is talking down to the audience.

The show can be very funny and heartwarming at times. It just has the typical shortcoming of shows of this time, it does overstay its welcome. It is great for the cable time period, where you would watch an episode and then another show would come on. And that is the way the show was made, good episodic random distraction for the day. But trying to sit down and watch the show from beginning to end, the jokes and characters do wear thin.

There are certain episodes where the show gets more serious like the highly rated ""Papa's got a Brand-new Excuse"", that I highly recommend. It is a mixed bag and begins to get stale towards the end. But there are some good ones in there that definitely make the show worth watching. Just sit right there, and find out how he became the prince of the town of Bel-Air."
"I used to be a big fan of this show as a teen growing up, but as an adult I find the antics of Will Smith's characters annoying and repugnant. In each episode, Smith acts like a jerk to someone or does something that will obviously negatively effect some other character. Then he continues to act like a jerk while attempting to cover up whatever misdeeds he previously took part in. All of this for the final five minutes where Smith has an epiphany and then is absolved of his actions.

Will Smith's character consists loud and goofy noises and constantly cracking jokes about his looks. His character is extremely narcissistic and classless. The only redeeming quality of this show is Uncle Phil who is actually a decent actor with good comedic timing. Too bad this show degrades his weight every week while going after the lowest common denominator"
"I like to think of ""The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air"" as a memorable rap song from a time when it wasn't afraid to be creative or witty. Think of a song by Public Enemy, De La Soul, A Tribe Called Quest, or hell, even The Fresh Prince's duo with DJ Jazzy Jeff (who guest stars frequently as Jazz), as the two were known back in rap's Golden Age as DJ Jazzy Jeff & the Fresh Prince.

Of course, this show flourished during a time when rap was still good, and I can't help but make comparisons to the hip-hop community. There is no question that Will Smith is a born entertainer, and he got his break in stardom outside of hip-hop with ""The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air."" In it, Will Smith pretty much plays Will Smith (I bet creators Andy and Susan Borowitz had a lot of difficulty thinking up that name), a Philadelphia ghetto youth who gets shipped out by his mother to the posh excess of Bel-Air to live with relatives - The Banks.

Once out there, he finds rivalry with cousins - the preppy Carlton and airheaded would-be blonde Hilary Banks (Alfonso Ribiero and Karyn Parsons), young cousin Ashley (Tatyana M. Ali) emulates Will's hip-hop attitude, and Aunt Vivian (alternately played by actresses Janet Hubert-Whitten and Daphne Maxwell Reid) keeps husband and successful lawyer Uncle Phil's (James Avery) head cool when Will gets into trouble. To keep everything tidy and in order, their loyal, sarcastic British butler Geoffrey (Joseph Marcell) is there too.

It's still fresh after all these years. It never fails to stir up careful, thoughtful, moving, and intelligent laughs from the viewer and I'm surprised I avoided it for so long. (Why do I do this to myself all the time?)

The acting is cool and fresh by all, especially from Smith, and the ladies of the house, Karyn and Tatyana, are both pretty cute to look at too."
"I have seen every single episode of this! It is so great! the whole family plays so good! They are all funny, Jazz too by the way! I still watch the episodes on BBC to tape them on video!

people who say the show is just about will are so not right! every character has several episodes where they are put in the picture. There a just a few less good episodes but most of them will make u rolling over the floor! :D :D :D :D D:"
"It's only really one word to say about this once hit show. H-I-L-A-R-I-O-U-S. It will always be remembered, one of the funniest shows known to mankind, every episode is laugh out loud hilarious. It doesn't get better.

Great idea, a kid coming from the ghetto to live with his rich relatives. You know already your in for some fun. Will Smith only became famous thanks to this show, he shows how funny he can really be. The rest of the cast are pretty much flawless too, this show will always have you laughing with a hilarious script and a fun adventure every episode. Thank god for the creators of this show and a wonderful cast. Yes the show is very old now, but still funny every time you watch it. If you haven't seen i strongly suggest you start watching. I promise you, you will laugh, a lot. There's a whole lot of dancing and fat jokes too! Brilliant show. One of the best in the 90's for sure."
"The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air is a hilarious family show full of laugh-out-loud humour and plenty of heartfelt dramatic moments that anyone can enjoy, in the same vein as Keeping Up Appearances (another brilliant comedy programme from the 1990s). I've literally seen this show so many times, I basically know it like the back of my hand.

This sitcom is filled to the brim with so many witty puns and sarcastic quips, that it'll leave you wondering how they where able to think up such creative jokes. One might even say it manages to subvert your expectations in a way you'd have never thought of before. Some of the more mature jokes like the innuendoes and double entendres will go over younger viewers' heads and keep adults laughing their heads off. The opening credits montage is accompanied by an upbeat jingle which lasts throughout the duration of its very addictive theme song.

Good humour is all about precise timing when it comes down to the comedic line deliveries and by letting the humorous moments flow naturally from the whacky events of the scenarios and situations the characters inevitably find themselves in, whereas bad humour will always feel as if it's being forcefully put in, which seems to be the case with just about nearly every stupid modern comedy film in recent years, pandering to a demographic of people with low attention spans by rapidly shoving in a bunch of dumb unfunny jokes to keep them amused. This just goes to show that it's still a funny sitcom after 3 decades and proves the '90s had much better comedy writers than we have nowadays.

Will Smith was perfect at playing an overacted version of his usual wise-cracking self. Alfonso Ribeiro was spot on as the innocent-minded, lovable and huggable Carlton. James Avery was great as the stern but caring father of the household, Uncle Phil. Karyn Parsons was a little annoying at first as the spoiled and self-centred Hilary, who acts like a selfish dumb blonde over the course of the whole entire series, but she soon grows on you. I have mixed feeling about Tatyana Ali as Ashley because on the one hand she was really sweet and adorable as a little girl in the first season but by the sixth season, when she fully matured from a moody adolescent into an incredibly attractive young woman, I thought she was extremely hot. DJ Jazzy Jeff's inclusion on the show may have started off as a running gag but he quickly evolved into a prominent recurring character who became a mainstay for the rest of the series. The stand out character for me would have to be the Banks' faithful butler Geoffrey, who is not the slightest bit afraid to openly speak his mind and has a very dry sense of sarcastic humour in contrast to the rest of the main cast's lively comedic performances.

It's fun, feel-good, family-friendly entertainment that's fit for people of all ages (and believe me, I should know). So what more is there left for me to really say about this other than just telling you to ""give it a watch, because I guarantee you won't be disappointed""."
"I was sick. Then dad was sick. And there was one thing 8 years later that I am just now connecting with this experience; The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air. I was 18, and my Crohn's was so severe that it took a few days for the doctors to even realize how bad things were. I remember drinking Go-Lightly for a colonoscopy I had the next day. It was late, and my dad had decided to stay with me alone. One of the few times this happened, but I don't blame him. Things were more touch and go than I realized. I remember drinking that nasty stuff-getting through it only by watching 30 min episodes of Fresh Prince with my dad, and hearing him tell me how brave I was. What I didn't realize at the time, is this show would get us through more than my illness. It got us through his as well.

My dad ended up passing on 6/18/2014 from non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Some nights he couldn't sleep at home. Some of those nights correlated with my insomnia. I would come upstairs to see him in a recliner, watching Fresh Prince. And I would happily join him in the living room. It meant something to me on the nights this would happen- but it means more to me now that it is 8+ years after his passing. We didn't realize it at the time; how much comfort the show gave to us through many years together of hard times. I will be forever grateful for the many extra hours that show gave to us."
"The Good= I like How this show did deal with some Heavy Handed Subjects. Such as Racism and Social Class just to name a couple.

Then there are all of the other things that I Personally like about this show. To start off is all of the Fourth Wall Breaks not only those were always fun but I'm always a big fan of those. Sadly there is one Fourth Wall Break Moment that I'm not a particularly a fan of. Sure it was during the End Credit Roll but still. As I found it way Over The Top even for a 90's Sitcom End Credit Sequence. And the moment that I'm Referring to is when Will Smith Jokingly tells Carlton that in order to escape he was forced to kill the person that was holding him hostage. Which non of that really happened as a bit of a Pay Back for the events of the episode. And in response Carlton Literally Ran Around all over the place including All of the Sets that were in that episode and to even the Live Audience Area. Screaming 'No' Darth Vader Style all the way through non stop. And at one point Carlton was on the Floor Crawling on just his Hands. With his body sort of resembling a Disabled Frogs.

Anyways moving on the Next thing I Really Love just wish there were a lot more moments like it. But I understand for obvious reasons why they do it very often in the show. And that would be that Fresh Prince Of Bel-Air does have Emotional Close To Tear Jerker, You Feel Like You Where Kick In The Heart Moments. Just wished the Final One just before the Show Ends didn't End With A Laugh Track when We'll Smith Both the Character and the Actor was fittingly be the one to turn off the Lights. It's too bad that could have been a really great moment.

Anyways next that I enjoy seeing all of the Guest Stars that they had on the show through out the years or seasons. Sure some I don't recognize but most I do. I'm so Glad that this show eventually Launched not only Well Smith the Actor's Acting Career and his Celebrity Status at the same time. And I think my favourite type of humour is the Sarcastic Humour that the Character of Geoffrey always had on the show. As it is the only type of humour that I seem to get. And I also love the friendship between Well and Carlton as it really feels Grounded and how Real Cousins would probably act in real life. And unless I'm Missing anything else that should do it for the Positives.

The Bad= As Funny and as Great as this show was I still have a few gripes with it a side from the ones I have mentioned in the Positive Section. Such as although I don't have any problems with them switching out the two Vivian Banks. It's that I felt that the First Vivian (Janet Hubert) was a much more Vivian Banks as with her version she played the type of woman and mother, and Professor Wife and Aunt you don't want to Mess With. While I felt that the Second Vivian Banks (Daphne Reid) is Kind and Soft and just about everything Opposite of what Janet's version of Viviane Banks was. Not that it's a big deal it's just given the choice I would rather prefer Janet Hubert's version, as I found her much entertaining to watch. Don't get me wrong Daphne is not an Actress or anything I enjoyed her version as well. But for whatever the reason Janet Hubert's version was just more memorable. It's just too bad that Janet Herbert had to leave the show for Behind The Scenes and Personal Issues. And while I'm on the subject I also wished did a little more with the Nicky Banks Character as I don't remember him being on the show very much, at least not as much as the other Banks Children. And when he just show up it just seems that he's just there to remind us that 'Oh Yeah Gave The Banks Kids A Baby Brother' and when he was in full episodes it just felt like he was just there for the Cuteness Factor.

Anyways moving on then next I just like how many 'Fake Outs' there was during during the shows run. It's like they enjoy no not just enjoy but live to call you the audience a 'Sucker' as they often revers storylines or other that they have set up just so they could seemingly call it a 'Plot Twist'. Oh sure some of their decisions are understandable able but often then not they just do it for the 'Twist' thing that I was talking about earlier. Anyways moving on again before I forget. It's just unfortunate in the DVD Version they not only Combined the Two Parter Halloween episodes in season one in to just one episode, but also the Normal Opening was used in this episode. Where as that Particular Episode as I have said was Supposed to be a Two Part Episode but also the Opening was supposed to be The Full Uncut Version. Then next I understand why but I don't know the Hilary Banks Character just feels like the Rich 90's Bimbo Stereotype which includes the way she talks. They also start a lot of Great Storylines and Concepts and Ideas but choose to never fallow up or even if they they never really bring then to a satisfying conclusion. And in the later seasons they seem to not only Recycle Old Ideas and Concepts that they already had in the Earlier Seasons, but also make a big fat joke out of them in the process, sadly which includes the Racism. And unless I'm missing anything else that should do it.

Final Thoughts= Still a lot Better than Bel-Air IMHO."
"the fresh prince of bel air is definitely my favorite show on nick at nite. it's one of my favorite shows ever, actually. i love Carlton's nerdyness and his dumb lines such as ""don't gt your panties in a bunch"" or ""why are we acting like people without trust funds"" or ""someone has their rude hat on today."" and i LOVE the Carlton dance! Alfonso is perfect for this role. i also love Hilary's stupidity. Karyn is great at delivering Hilary's lines, and makes sure they are hysterical with her little stupid faces at the end. Karyn was also made for that role. Nicky is just the cutest little thing!!!!!!!! I'm sorry i don't know who played him, but whoever did is adorable in that role! i love the evil looks that Phil gives will when he's mad. James excels at that role, and even though Phil is not the funniest character, James makes Phil's funny moments more entertaining. Ashley is not one of my favorites, but she is still a likable character, and Tatyana is a talented actress. of course, will is hysterical, and although the character is a bit stereotypical, will smith has so much talent and cracks me up in plenty of episodes. and i like the theme song. the only reason that i gave this show nine stars in stead of ten is Vivian. her character is okay, i suppose. and i liked Daphne maxwell Reid as Vivian. but i really did not like Janet Hubart Whitten at all. she looks like an evil person that wants to conquer the free world, which sometimes scares the s*** out of me. and she's also seriously annoying. except for her, great show!"
"The first two seasons are immensely watchable. The characters are well shaped complimenting each other into a team that together made a great ensemble. There also was a certain depth and context to the small plots in each episode. But from the third season, to me, it just went all downhill. The characters felt as if their IQs were shaved by 30 points and EQs halved. They felt more like caricatures than characters with too much over the top dialogues and acting. Maybe that was what was needed to keep the series popular, I wouldn't know. But then it lost my interest. But I still recommend watching the first two seasons for almost anyone, especially families."
"Will Smith may have gotten better over the years, but in FPoBA he sucked. Also, people calling FPoBA the best sitcom ever its...insane, to say the least. It was never the best if anything. In the 90's there was Seinfeld, enough said. Now...30 years later, its just cringe, purely unwatchable."
"I loved watching Alias. It was one of the few series where I would freak out if I missed an episode - it was just that good. Season 1 through 3 were the best seasons though and I think it got rather heavy after that - ridiculous plot lines and Sloane's crazy obsession with Rembaldi, clones...

The cast are terrific - Jennifer Garner's such a terrific actress and she's surrounded by a stellar cast - Victor Garber, Michael Vartan, Ron Rifkin..

It really is a great show - if you don't mind the confusion now and again and just watch it with an open mind, take it for what it is - a really great series!"
"Give or take, Garner was 30 years old when Alias hit the big screen and there was no turning back for her.

Have heard so many different stories about how she was ""discovered"" in Tinseltown that I do not know which to believe.

What I do know is that, for a period of time, JG was the new ""it girl"", she could do no wrong, and audiences simply could not get enough of her.

Alias, which ran for 5 years, was simply an OK premise taken to heights of high-camp based solely on the star power of Garner.

She was hot, she could act, she could do stunts, she had great reaction shots, and she made it all seem so easy. Even her film roles in his period are worth a look (which is another section of the IMDb entirely).

Recommended for teenage boys of all ages."
"From the very first episode to the series' final moment, 'Alias' never failed to keep me on the edge of my seat. Dramatic, funny, thrilling, action-packed and smart, it brings you through so many twists and turns that you may have to come up for air once in a while, but will undoubtedly find yourself diving in for more. Three years after its conclusion 'Alias' still remains my favorite show, thanks to a stellar cast, gripping score, intelligent writers and great production values; with the lovely Jennifer Garner being the glue that holds it all together, and of course, the brainchild behind it all, J.J. Abrams. Part James Bond, part Indiana Jones, Garner's Sydney Bristow is a hero for the ages. 'Alias' is at once epic, heart-warming, exciting, and ultimately unforgettable; a true gem in the history of serialized television."
"I simply cannot understand anyone who slates this show, unless perhaps they simply were not intelligent enough to follow it's superbly complex and intricate story. The immaculate acting of both Victor Garber and Ron Rifkin alone should be enough for anyone, but the incredible plot twists and threads, superb character development and, dare I mention it, exciting action sequences too, just add to this outstanding show.

Personally, I was hooked from the first episode, but I strongly urge anyone who has either never seen it, or seen a few episodes and dismissed it, to give it a chance. I agree it might be a little frustrating, particularly in the first two seasons, because (much like that other fantastic JJA show, Lost) each episode leads directly into the next and so missing an episode can be confusing, but it really is worth it.

Watching the final episode and understanding just how everything in the past five years has been building up to the conclusion made me realise just how talented the writers were. Although I am glad the show went out on a high (although there never really was a low point), I still mourn the loss of possibly the greatest television show on Earth."
"This show is one of the most consistently entertaining shows I have seen. If you've a mind to, as many seem to do, you can find any number of reasons to rate this programme lowly but it is undoubtedly one of the best shows of recent years. It doesn't take itself too seriously but manages to involve the viewer time after time with character development and the intricate plotting. Garner takes on the lead role enthusiastically and, even in the most absurd situations, carries it all off with great aplomb. Victor Garber, as Jack Bristow, is the mainstay of the show and deals with everything that comes his way in a professional and confident manner. All the other characters (and actors) fulfil their roles superbly. Anyone who thinks this show is poor either enjoys badmouthing or cannot appreciate simple enjoyment. Sit back and enjoy."
"Just watched the whole series again. Still one of my all time favourites. Extremely binge-worthy! Loved every moment. Amazing actors, a fantastic storyline and awesome dialogue. The perfect combination of action, romance, intrigue and wit. Do yourself a favour!"
"I love this show. That being said, it has some flaws. You can tell when it went downhill is when J.J. Abrams stopped working on it regularly. Season 1 is great, Season 2 is great, Season 3 was OK, Season 4 not so great, and I'm going to pretend Season 5 didn't happen. I'd have to agree with some of other reviewers on here, it seems like they ended up with a bunch of different writers that lost direction or understanding of what the show was about and where it was supposed to be going. It started out as a spy show with a hint of sci-fi, and ended up the other way around which was just weird. It seems like the only person who really understood the whole Rambaldi thing was JJ. I think that the actors did a good job with what they were given. Watch Season 1-3 if you want to check it out. Its on Netflix as of 8/16."
"I just finished the first season. So far it is amazing !! I haven't seen a very good series for a few years now. So far it's amazing. It reminds me other very good series, I used to watch in the past. I was surprised to see Quentin Tarantino playing in 2 episodes, so far. Most actors are very good in their role and convincing. Even if it is old, it doesn't looks old. Very good job so far."
"This high budget TV show. It uses lush, dramatic, international sets.

The plot has layers upon layers. It is like the old Saturday afternoon serials, ending each episode with a cliff hanger. I think this show is primarily the work of women. Our heroine, Jennifer Garner as Sydney Bristow, dresses in elaborate high-fashion costumes, makeup and hair barely recognisable each time. There are plenty of handsome charming young men who adore her. The focus is on relationships.

Jennifer Garner runs for miles at top speed in every episode. The stunts are well done. It appears Garner is doing them herself. It is quite an athletic performance.

Garner speaks a number of languages in each episode (without subtitles). I don't speak these languages, but her accent was very convincing.

They did a number of technical things that made me angry they were so inept. Sydney moves back and forth between two groups of warring spy agencies without taking any precautions that she is being followed or that her phone is tapped. She dismantles a nuke and holds up a grey sphere which she proclaimed is the plutonium core. Plutonium is radioactive, and as soon as it is formed into a sphere it explodes. Oddly road flares go off in a bank vault.

She is a double agent, but at times does some bit of daring for both simultaneously. The plot often does not make sense, which amusingly one of the characters points out."
"I remember this show debuting when I was a teenager. I was so engrossed in it that I was considering one day becoming a government agent. Looking back at this, it still holds up. Between the clever story telling, and character development, it also shows a bit of the spy cliches that I fell in love with. It's also pretty crazy to see a young Bradley Cooper and where he would go from here. The gadgets and technology that is used in the show may look dated but I think it gave Alias its charm. I would love to see Abrams try to come back to this project and bring it to the modern day audiences."
"I've seen many series, and movies which are cop or espionage procedural or a mix of both, like 24,prison break, etc. But when it comes to Alias the the first roll is a woman and a hero ,it makes me more excited. Sidney Bristow became my roll model while I watched it, though I think to have all those talents together is imaginary or fantasy ,however I loved the dream sold. And the most important is that it has almost a happy end ,unlike most of similar movies or Tv series. The button end is that it is a fun, fast paced, moving spy series that shows everything you expect from it and makes you believe the unbelievable."
"Jennifer Garner is the best , love her doing action movies and this is a great series.

She should do more. The other agent is good too. Let's see more series with them both in please."
"College student Sydney Bristow (Jennifer Garner) is working for SD-6, a secret division within the CIA. Arvin Sloane (Ron Rifkin) is the head and Marcus Dixon (Carl Lumbly) is her partner. Her friends Will Tippin (Bradley Cooper) and Francie Calfo are clueless to her double life. Then it's revealed that SD-6 is a vast criminal conspiracy opposed to the CIA. She gets Michael Vaughn (Michael Vartan) as her CIA handler. Her estranged father Jack Bristow (Victor Garber) is also a double agent inside to bring down SD-6.

This is JJ Abrams' second big hit after Felicity and launches him on his way to being one of the biggest name in Hollywood. It's a simple concept of a hot supermodel 007 Jenny Bond in a secret worldwide spy organization. It's completely unreal fantasy. There is nothing but popcorn fun here. The problem is that as this fantasy universe gets rolling. It made less and less sense. The twists and turns lead to too many blind alleys. It's too serious and eventually, the show collapses under the weight of it's convoluted story. The good thing is that it introduced the world to Jennifer Garner and Bradley Cooper. Now can somebody tell me what happened to Michael Vartan?"
"Although Alias may not be correct in everything it displays, what TV show is? it has everything a good series should have; action, romance, and characters that aren't idiots. Each character delivers something new and different to the screen. The plot is always moving and it's hard to tell where it's going, so when you arrive.. it's a complete surprise! With unending twists and turns, never knowing good characters from bad, the viewer simply falls into the plot and feels like they, instead of Sydney, are the main character. The only thing bad to say about the series is it sometimes takes a bit too much time to get into the plot- especially at the beginning of season 1. but, continue in and you'll find a series worth watching, a series worth buying and collecting."
"Simply amazing, from the second I turned it on to the last episode (after which I didn't know what to do with myself) I literally couldn't stop watching. I needed up staying up til 3am watching its immense. Such a strong female lead with so many twists and turns. A show perfectly done- the writing, the acting, the costumes, etc. I'm still hoping for a spin off."
"""Alias"" is a knock-off of the earlier TV series ""Nikita"" which was a knock-off of a hit French cult flick by Luc Besson. The parallels are undeniable. Both feature reluctant hardbodied secret agent hotties who use disguises, martial arts, hi-tech gadgetry, and the resources of their super secret ops group to rid the world of evil. Both protags work directly for men who they love without reciprocity and organizations so secret that anyone who threatens it will be compromised/cancelled/kaput. Etc. Both series require swallowing a lot of improbabilities and impossibilities as the globe trotting bootie kicking babes work through their secret missions making audience ease of disbelief suspension a necessity. Although Garner has the range she is not always well directed and IMHO doesn't have the hottie charisma which Peta Wilson seems to exude naturally. However, ""Alias"" seems to have better production value though it's less edgy and annoyingly ends on cliff hangers while ""Nikita"" wraps up each episode. Those who have enjoyed one might want to give the other a look. (B-)"
"ALIAS is the drama series I could never decide whether to be loved or hated. Probably one the most entertaining shows I've ever seen on TV, but also one of the biggest disappointments in my life. Now, how comes that? Arguably, Alias is a great example on how to ruin a drama show that started out with such a great potential. Not with a ground-breakingly original idea (the show obviously resembles La Femme Fatale Nikita and dozens of similar espionage stories), but with its interesting characters and slightly unrealistic but rather clever story lines and plot twists, it DOES manage to get you hooked, after just a few episodes (provided you get to see the right episodes). It sounds good so far, so what the hell went wrong?

Well, during its 5-years run, nearly everything. Too bad Alias never managed to become a mainstream show, somehow it always remained kind of underground, a cult show, having said that its ratings never were what network executives expected. Which, despite the initial hype around the show, really was a shame. That was why the network finally decided to tamper with Alias, and the results were somewhat mixed. So it wasn't long before the show started to lose its fanbase, its core audience, and since the show never had sky-high ratings, I consider losing its fanbase... well, the obvious downhill of Alias. For me, it definitely was season four, when ABC had an attempt to introduce Alias to a larger audience, so they had JJ Abrams reboot the show, yet again. Nothing wrong with that... except it went horribly wrong, in my opinion. ABC's idiotic mandates such as avoiding any potentially great long-term plot or mystery (including Rambaldi) made the show so simplistic, so dumbed down, that you might as well have watched any other drama series involving dumb CIA agents fighting dumb terrorist organizations. Gone are the plot twists, the interesting story lines, even the cliffhangers, Alias had lost nearly all of its elements that kept us watching it week to week, only to introduce awfully uninteresting, clichéd stand-alone episodes and dumb criminals that no-one ever cared about. Only when the fourth season came to an end, it was terribly disappointing too. The writers' attempts to make up for the boredom in the first half of the season were absolutely ridiculous, and I just couldn't believe why the same producers that banned Alias from being intelligent and creative (not to mention the Rambaldi storyline) let the season's (and apparently the Rambaldi storyline's) conclusion turn into something that resembles some low-budget 70's horror flick. Undoubtedly that was when I realised that Alias had turned into something it was never supposed to be, and I was praying that the fifth season would somehow make up for the disappointment of the fourth.

Sadly, it didn't. Banning Rambaldi again for about the half of season five (but at least not being so desperate about the self-contained format as in season 4), the network clearly had no idea about what they were doing and how much harm their tampering would cause to the show. However, it quickly became clear that Alias would be cancelled, so all we could expect that all the story lines and mysteries would finally be resolved. We also hoped that it would go out with a bang - with the same bang it was introduced to us. But every now and then, we were let down. Really let down.

Most of the blame should fall on ABC, for constantly dumbing down Alias and turning it into something it was never supposed to be, and JJ Abrams, who had abandoned the show and moved on to Lost, leaving his own 'child' for the dead (which you might consider a successful move if you are a Lost fan, but otherwise you might as well hate Abrams forever). They should have asked themselves the question: is Alias exactly the same great, intelligent, exciting, suspenseful drama that the audience came to know in its first season? And if there's even a slight possibility that the answer would be 'No'... then clearly, something has gone wrong. Horribly wrong. And it needs fixing. That is what the creators of Alias, along with the network, always failed to do. And this is what led to the ultimate destruction of a once-great TV show. So to answer my initial question: the show is to be loved, and the creators are to be hated for killing it.

(Let's be a little bit rude with the rating. The first 2 seasons were near-perfect, the third was a so-so, the last 2 were utter crap. Golden mean it is, I give Alias 5 stars.)"
"Alias has to be one of the best shows aired on television. Its fun, its sharp, its intense, and you just gotta love it. Though the story line did get side tracked and was most of the time too confusing for new viewers to catch on, Alias was a weekly ritual for fans. Jennifer Garner was gorgeous and the genius JJ Abrams himself never ceased to wow fans with action and thrills. One of the best things about the show I believe was the way Sydney (Jennifer Garner) was forced to balance her life of being an agent and keeping her cover. How she handles love, betrayal, and lies makes the show an absolute joy to watch. My advise to those people who have heard of this show but are looking for opinions......rent the first season and you'll be hooked to watched to watch the following 4. Happy watching!"
"This was definitely a show not to be taken seriously...but therein lies the key to great TV entertainment. Anthology series, by definition, can be very fun and addicting because they don't require the viewer to be well versed in some complex arching storyline. Each episode is stand-alone, and with this series in particular the 30 minute time frame flies right by...leading you to watch another! About the time, yes, some episodes feel as though they could have benefited from additional time to contain all of the complex twists and turns. Then again, that is also why it is so much fun! Not time consuming.

Horror fans (especially), but also fans of comedy, or just plain old fashioned (sometimes simple minded even cheesy) storytelling will get a kick out of this series. And the Cryptkeeper? Pop culture icon, with all of those puns! Ever been to Spencer's gifts...remember the lifesized Cryptkeeper animatronic figure they sold for awhile. What other TV shows inspires such worship! If you're familiar with the series and think you would like to revisit it...you will not be disappointed (the DVD's are priced low!). If by chance you've never seen it, check it out...it's a blast. Not even in a category with other shows other than maybe The Twilight Zone, but also uniquely different!"
"I have always been a fan of the series. This is the kind of stuff I grew up on. I loved this show when I was a kid, so much that I even read some of the old comics. There is always a moral to each story. (most of which seem to involve betraying lovers for some odd reason) Although some episodes are so far out there they come off as being lame at times I can't help but love them. Every episode is like it's own little horror movie. I highly recommend the series,especially now that it is coming out on DVD. You get a lot of entertainment for your money. Thats all I have to say about this series and as the crypt keeper would say ""Good night boils and ghouls."""
"Tales from the Crypt is a series that ran for a full seven seasons, with the last one being entirely filmed in the UK. Each episode has a dark story of love, hate, pain, death or a mix of any of the above with a little twist of dark humour thrown in for good measure.

This show proves that a low budget and cheesy monsters cannot ruin great writing, fantastic acting and naughty hidden gags.

If you choose to take my advice and watch this programme, you will find many huge names making early appearances. I personally enjoyed the episode with Ewan McGregor. I won't ruin the ending of this episode, but suffice it to say, you probably won't see it coming."
"Oh man, I miss this show so very much. I wish upon oh so many stars for them to bring it back. *sigh* There aren't many shows EVER to have a whole new storyline every episode. And for the ones there are, none of them can even begin to compare with this one. It had EVERYTHING; humor, horror, drama, and an amazing, original host to start each episode off: The Cryptkeeper.

There may be other shows that are similar, but none will ever have anything like the Cryptkeeper. When I was younger, I was terrified of him. But as I got older I listened more to what he said and realized how hilarious he was. Not because his jokes were funny, but more because of how corny they are, but yet he thinks they are just the funniest things in the world.

The thing is is that if you haven't seen this show then you definitely need to go out and buy the episodes. And if you don't feel like taking a big step like that, go rent them, then you can buy them. I, myself, am waiting eagerly for them to put the rest of the seasons on DVD so I can have a HUGE marathon of nothing but ""Tales From the Crypt""!"
"There have been many shows that were never intended to be taken seriously, but ""Tales from the Crypt"" brings the idea to a whole new level. Each episode begins by descending into what appears to be a haunted house, where we get introduced to the delightfully creepy Crypt Keeper. He explains (as sardonically as possible) what we're about to watch. Then, each episode tells a story involving a really nasty situation; some involve monsters, others involve people doing really unpleasant things, but they all make one laugh. I really liked the episode where Don Rickles played a most unusual puppeteer, and also the episode where Christopher Reeve opened a restaurant...of sorts. Granted, this show was kind of ridiculous, but they never lost their timing, even with the Crypt Keeper's silly remarks. Just remember that, kiddies. Hee hee hee!"
"It is without exception the greatest series of all time. The acting by everyone was great and the Cryptkeepers's puns were hilarious (Just goes to show you kiddies, Be very careful what you Axe For Christmas, You Just Might Get it!) (I Call tonight's Putrid Piece ""What's Cookin"". This series will beat hands down any of the crap out there today. It was kind of like the Twilight Zone of the 90's. All the big and Upcoming stars were in the episodes. You had Lou Diamond Phillips, Priscillia Presley, Larry Drake, Ed Begley Jr, Judd Nelson, Christopher Reeve, Joe Pesci, Jeffrey Jones, Alan Ruck, Cheech Marin, Martin Sheen, Billy Zane, Anthong Michael Hall, Brooke Shields, and many others. The episodes were true to the comics and didn't try to change anything. The Best thing by far was John Kassir doing the Cryptkeeper's voice. That was fantastic and timeless."
"The 80s were a golden age of horror. Ultra violent, lewd, irreverent, and before CG effects started to take over. Tales from the Crypt is the perfect distillation of that era. Each episode was a self contained short story. Most episodes have lots of profanity, softcore nudity, gore, violence, but it never takes itself too seriously. Most episodes are bad things happening to bad people. While some episodes are pretty hit and miss, the host of the series, the Cryptkeeper, is a show stealing. The puppetry of this character is fantastic, but not enough good things can be said about the voice actor. Cryptkeeper drops puns at a mile a minute. If you thought one was corny, don't worry he's got another one coming to make up for it. Don't let his appearance fool you, this is one lovable ghoul. As if that wasn't good enough, the musical score is made by none other than Danny Elfman of Batman, Beetlejuice, and Edward Scissorhands fame. Highly recommended for 80s horror fans."
"I can remember the little cryptkeeper dude from growing up but last summer I binged watched through this entire series and OMG was it gooood! I didn't even know it was HBO?

Totally forgot how many memorable episodes there were and how many cool stars from back in the 90s showed up. Like Demi Moore looking super-young or Arnold Schwarzenegger directing?!!

But the best part is of course the little cryptkeeper man talking before and after the episode. He's so cheezey but funny! Like you wish he was your pet or something. I don't know.

But you HAVE to watch this show if you like HORROR at all!"
"Funny good old horror show with some really good ideas, dark humor and a good production and almost every episode got a fine cast.

The short playtime per episode of 25 minutes make this one a quick fine snack for the connoisseur of creep 'n' horror. Binge-watching highly recommended too."
"As a kid I frickin' loved this show with a fiery exuberant passion, I worshipped it, the sting in the tale just desserts style of the horror where the bad and guilty were generally punished gruesomely in priceless and delicious twist endings came to be what the ideal version of horror is to me, grim, deadly, but with a certain underlying sense of fun and sly humour about itself and has a subtle sense of twisted karmic justice. This has always been for me by far the best horror anthology show out there and always thoroughly blew all others of its ilk clear out of the water and its sharp tone and kick-ass attitude, as well as the healthy degree of the gleeful gory old Grand Guignol spirit put into it, all resonated with me in a huge way and a lot of those earlier season episodes went right into my memory and stayed there, this show was one of the main things that ignited my lifelong appreciation of the genre. As a show today it remains such a gem of pop horror culture, and a lot of that is down to John Kassir as the one and only Cryptkeeper. What a rotten cackling old sweetheart, what a voice, what a laugh!!! With a limitless supply of lovably groan-inducing horror-related puns and plays on words, he brought the fun and wrapped up the tales as only he could. It just wouldn't have been the same without our dear old Crypty! To me, at least the first three seasons had so much heart and wicked love for the craft put into them that you could really feel that they were trying to express in film the dark fun style of the old E.C. comics the same way that the 1972 Amicus film also named ""Tales From the Crypt"" and the 1982 anthology masterpiece ""Creepshow"" had previously done so perfectly. I tried to never miss an episode and even if it had been a bad one I wouldn't have noticed! You got the really tongue-in-cheek fun schlocky tales that are noticeably trying to showcase the style of the source material and do to me really feel like macabre crazy comics come to life, like ""And All Through the House"", ""The Switch"", ""Till Death"", ""Loved to Death"", ""The Ventriloquist's Dummy"", and the truly excellent ""Carrion Death"". Most were horror comedies, but there were more haunting and foreboding horrific offerings such as ""Three's a Crowd"" ""Fitting Punishment"" and especially ""Abra Cadaver"", which sure as hell gets my vote as the scariest episode because it feels like it holds a chilling grain of truth... It really took off fantastically in the second season which I consider the best because it has the biggest concentration of episodes that I personally consider great. The quality sadly did decline a little with each season with spots of greatness here and there, until we finally hit the abominable seventh season, a season that I find so monstrously awful that I don't even care to own it, it was just that cheap and terrible and just so distinctly UN-Crypt. It's the reason I consider there to be 6 seasons of the show, and one runt! Anyway for the majority of its run it was just wonderful and had so many awesome moments that were liable to leave you shocked or in stitches, and it was tailor made for the horror lover who was young at heart. For the most part they got it dead right and captured the precious macabre magic that they intended to. Not perfect, but it took care of the things that really mattered. Thanks for all the laughs screams and happy memories Cryptkeeper!"
"I didn't have HBO when this played (I still don't have it) so I'm just catching up on it now the DVDs being released. I'm a big fan of the old comic (I have all the issues that were reprinted in the 1990s) and I had heard this series was really strong stuff. I did see the edited episodes that popped up on regular TV...but the cuts were obvious and rendered some of the stories incomprehensible. Now I'm finally seeing them uncut. The verdict? They're OK.

The casts are great (it's fun seeing Brad Pitt before he hit it big) and there's some well-directed episodes...but I find this series lacking somewhat. For starters, it's not as extreme as I heard. With the sole exception of ""Lover Come Hack To Me"" from season one there's next to no blood or gore. There's some minor swearing and occasional flashes of nudity--but where's all the blood and violence I heard this contained? I'm just finishing season 4 and have yet to see one episode that I could call very bloody. You don't need that to make it scary, but I heard for years that this was pretty violent and blood-drenched. It's not. Also some of the writing is very poor and the some of the episodes seem rushed (but they only had about half an hour to get in everything). Also, it's just not scary. Not one episode has even remotely spooked me. So, it's worth seeing for the casts and directors but it's no big deal. A 7."
"I do not know, just seemed it was on a lot longer than from 1989-1996 to me. Seems like it made it to like 1998 or something. However, I do know this horror show hosted by the friendly and insane crypt keeper was a rather fun show, of course some episodes were better than others as it is your ""Tales from the Darkside"" type format with every episode being something different. There were some weak shows and then there were some very strong episodes to be had, the one constant was the host of the show an animatronic decomposing creature known as the crypt keeper who would both introduce then wrap up every episode. Within the first season or so you would see remakes of the different episodes of the 1970's ""Tales from the Crypt"" movie as they did the one with Santa Claus which was better than the original, and the one with the blind folk which was not as good as the original. There was one more in that movie, however, for the life of me I can not remember what it consisted of. Other ones that stand out in my mind are the one about the kid who has a secret who gets adopted by couple who also has a secret, one where a crazy couple gets involved with a vampire and many other shows that would prove to be interesting. Then they had ones that might as well been comedies like the one involving the guy who hears his conscience for the first time in the form of Sam Kinnison's voice. All in all a rather good horror show, a type not really seen anymore on television which is kind of sad."
"Remember all the buzz about this show when it first launched? It was supposed to be the best thing since Rod Serling. Nobody seems to remember it now, but the initial reaction from viewers was pretty cool. There was a reason for that.

I won't belabor the silly, ham-bone nature of the puppet that provides the intros. I won't even comment on the grossly over-estimated contributions of ""horror icons"" occasionally signed on to direct an episode or two. Let's just talk about the stories.

In the old days, shows like ""Twilight Zone"" and ""Alfred Hitchcock Presents"" gave anthology lovers interesting stories about real (as in identifiable) people in striking situations...all the ingredients for a good ride.

""Tales From the Crypt"" was, however, a contrived camp-fest which tried too hard to be outrageous. Its scripts overstepped themselves routinely, with cartoon-like characters and situations lacking the simple ring of truth. Many entries were mind-numbing gab-fests, in which the producers took a 5-minute concept and padded it to fill the show's run time. The ""big twist"" in many instances tended to be so disappointing viewers kicked themselves for having endured the entire episode hoping for a payoff that just wasn't worth it.

Supposedly this show is coming back to syndication, to disappoint a whole new generation. I can hardly wait to ignore it."
"If you are a somewhat warped person with a dark sense of humor, you'll really like this offering. Obviously I plead guilty because I liked this, although one of episodes turned me off. Nonetheless, it's very entertaining because of the effective mix of comedy, suspense, horror and originality.

You only get six stories from this opening (1989) season of horror-comedy on cable television, but at a fairly cheap price, the DVD set still is well worth it.

In addition to the crazy stories, you get some surprisingly good cinematography. The picture isn't razor sharp but it's well-photographed. Some pretty big directors in the film business - Richard Donner, Robert Zemeckis, Joel Silver, David Giler and Walter Hill - are involved.

Each show features an actor or two who's familiar and they must have had fun making these. You can just see it as they ham it up in their roles. Warning: the language is rough. This is R-rated material....and perhaps only for sick people, as I must be."
"stars: John Kassir as the Cryptkeeper.

Usually great horror anthology show hosted by the Cryptkeeper, a rotting corpse done through animatronics. It's hard to rate it as an entire series, because the episodes went from really bad, to excellent. I will review the first and second season(out on DVD now) Season one-6 episodes. 160 mins. This was obviously the starter season, so there were some glitches. The first is the Cryptkeeper, who really didn't look all that great this season. He didn't yet evolve with his facial movements yet. As for episodes, the classics were Man Who Was Death and Dig that Cat hes Real Gone. The really good ones were Collection completed and All Through the House. Then there was Only Sin Deep and Lover Come Hack to Me. My rating-B plus.

Season 2-18 episodes. 470 mins. The Cryptkeeper has evolved to great lip and eye movement. As for the series, this season has some good ones. I'm not going to go into all of them, but they are good. Some of the classics are Television Terror, Korman's Kalamity, Cutting Cards, The Switch, For Crying Out Loud, The Ventiliquists Dummy and Lower Berth. Great season. My rating-A.

My rating of the series in all-A. episode lengths-(approx.)27 minutes with no commercials. TV:MA:LVS"
"From executive producers Joel Silver, Robert Zemeckis, Richard Donner, David Giler, and Walter Hill come one of the greatest anthology series of all time. Based upon the comic books of the fifties, the cryptkeeper invites you to 93 tales of terror, sex, violence, and twists. Boasting performances from Demi Moore, Brad Pitt, Bill Paxton, Billy Zane, Joe Pesci, John Lithgow, Joe Pantiliano, William Sadler, Timothy Dalton, Dylan McDermott, Tom Hanks, Arnold Schwarzaneggar, Whoopi Goldberg, Michael J. Fox, David Morse, Blythe Danner, Clearance Williams III, M. Emmett Walsh, Kelly Preston, Lance Henriksen, and countless others, the show earns a strong dramatic center to hold up the ghoulish, macabre story lines. All Seven seasons are currently available on DVD(finally)and are more than worth viewing for anyone from the most die-hard horror fans to appreciators of really good television."
"I used to sneak downstairs in my parents house when I was little to watch this show, late on Wednesday nights. I recently re-watched all 7 seasons again. Every show deals with the morals human beings go through each day, also every episode ends with a twist only M. Night Shyamalan could only wish to write (and if you thought the Sixth Sense had a great twist, you will love Tales From The Crypt) Maybe not exactly scary, but entertaining nonetheless. Some episodes are downright funny (The Assassin) to creepy (Only Skin Deep) and totally clever (Last Respects). The first few seasons are really worth watching, whereas the last 2 seasons seemed to recycle old story lines... how many times can a dead body get revenge? I only wish this show would return to it's home on HBO. We haven't seen television like this since it was off-air. And I know I'm not alone in wanting to hear ""Hello boils and ghouls!"" one more time around."
"There's something so weirdly joyful about Tales From the Crypt. it's rarely truly scary, but there are great performances, clever writing, and excellent special effects. If you stay away from the final season, which loses a bit of luster, you'll be good.

Some of the finest episodes include: ""All Through The House"", ""Mute Witness To Murder"", ""Dead Right"", ""The Secret"", ""Television Terror"", and ""Three's A Crowd."""
"This is a great show. It is very well written. Some stories are better than others. Some even have moral lessons. Each season is different. The crypt keeper is funny and has puns fit for a dad as ""dad jokes"" or should I say ""dead jokes?"" This show is definitely NOT for kids! Despite the crypt keeper saying ""boys and ghouls"".

This show will make you laugh and cringe. This is such a mixed up show you never know what's next. The stories are generally entertaining. Some stories take place during the time when the comic series started out in the 1950s through more modern times. There's many plot twists and twists in general.

You won't be disappointed watching this show. I'd rather watch this than other adult comedy or HBO shows. For those of a sensitive type, this show is NOT satanic. Well worth a watch."
"Maybe I was already too old, but I hated this series with a passion. Sure, the Cryptkeeper puppet was cool, but the episodes were BAD - really bad, and relied more on gore then scares. The one thing it had going for it: It was better then ""Tales from the Darkside"" but then again, staring at a sleeping dog was better that that.

My recommendation: See the original movie with Peter Cushing, Joan Collins and others - it blows the entire series away. In fact, if you're a fan of the movie, check out ""Asylum"" and ""The House that Dripped Blood"". All of these movies were made up small stories, and good old fashioned horror. Not all were winners, but even the worse was better then the series best."
"Not only was every episode meticulously crafted into thirty minutes of ironic terror, but the forces behind it always remained credible enough to deliver star-studded episodes. Jon Kassir's Crypt Keeper remains one of the more sacred pop culture figures of recent years (when's the last time you saw someone trashing the Keeper? He's an icon for chrissakes), and while some of the stories may not have been on caliber with others (most of the ""England"" episodes never touched the Demi Moore/""if I can't have you, no one will"" one), in the end, when the smoke had cleared and the show was over, you looked at it with a refreshing zing, as if you had embraced being had.

Bringing back the EC stories wasn't a simple task. Speilberg tried it with ""Amazing Stories"" and gave up after two long years. The ""Vault Of Horror"" got a limited run in 94, but failed. But Tales always stuck around, on its own terms, and gave up swinging.

"This is what got me into horror since the age of 5, thank you."
"Orange is the New Black is every bit as good as everyone says it is and it's definitely worth watching. While some seasons are better than others, they're all worth watching. It also has a very satisfying ending which we all know is hard to do with a good show. In fact the whole last season is one of the best. Bottom line is I was entertained throughout the entire series. This series won a ton of awards throughout its run and for very good reason. Having said that, I think Wentworth is the better show about a women's prison. If you haven't seen this yet do yourself a favor and go check it out."
"Orange is the New Black was one of Netflixs first breakout shows. It's about the lives of inmates and the guards of a women prison. It starts with a woman who is sent to prison for transporting drug money to her ex-girlfriend. She's a pretty good person who doesn't deserve to be in jail but still ends up there. It covers issues that are relevant today and shines a light on even more problems that people should know about. This is a dark comedy that with a very talented ensemble cast. It maintained a high level of quality throughout all seven seasons, obviously some seasons were better than others but none felt boring and were all worth watching. It's is a show that's definitely best watched if you binge it."
"(Updated after Season 7)

The story of your average early-30s female yuppie who gets sent to prison for 15 months for a crime she committed 10 years earlier. Season 1 Episode 1 shows her checking into the prison, and the rest is what goes on inside, plus the effects of her incarceration on her friends and family.

Initially I thought it was going to a female version of Oz, but it is far better than that. Multi-dimensional: funny, sensitive and sometimes dark. There is heaps of depth to the characters. Clever use of pre-prison flashbacks to show what motivates characters in certain situations, and how they got to be in jail. Very sensitively done, it often shows how their personalities were shaped.

This also serves to show that you can't simply judge people by their current actions - everyone has heaps of baggage.

Superb performances from a spot-on cast.

So different to what I expected, and very pleasantly so.

Season 4 continues the good work and was the usual mix of powerful drama and biting comedy. Maybe a bit darker and deeper than previous seasons due to covering issues of insanity, depression, guard brutality and prisoners' lives once they get out of prison. Some characters who didn't get much focus in previous seasons get more of the limelight, while others get less. One of the casualties is Pennsatucky / Doggett (Taryn Manning), which is a shame as she is one of my favourites - multi-layered and funny. On the plus side, Lolly (Lori Petty) gets much more screen time and she is great: funny and sad, all at the same time.

The last two episodes of Season 4 are incredibly powerful and moving.

Season 5 picks up where S4 left off and shows that the writers had certainly not run out of ideas. At a point when most series start to feel jaded, Orange is the New Black was as strong and fresh as ever.

However, Season 5 does mark a turning point, as the show moves from being predominantly character-based to more plot-based. This is a negative thing, as it was the characters and their stories that make the show so engaging.

Season 6 is where the novelty starts to wear off and the writing starts to show signs of weakness. The setting and situation were new: the Max side of the prison, complete with the more limited freedom it presents, plus grittier, more dangerous characters. This made for some interesting possibilities and the writers used these fairly well.

However, the character engagement, usually OITNB's strongest feature, is now largely missing. Tasha Jefferson is the only character whose story is worth following, and this gets drawn out to the nth degree. Piper Chapman, being irritating (though I think this was more due to Taylor Schilling's performance than anything else), was never worth supporting and this season is no exception. She does, however, provide the most emotional moment of the season.

The lack of engagement in the season is largely due to some previously-likeable/interesting characters being made into irritating characters. The over-the-topness of Red and Lorna's dialogue and general drama constantly made me tune out whenever they appeared.

There are a host of new characters but none are worth supporting. Their introduction also dilutes the impact of the characters and stories you do care about.

Overall Season 6 was watchable but it did feel like a chore at times.

The downward trajectory continues in the final season, Season 7. By now it is all plot-based and the engagement levels are close to zero. The plots themselves feel like retreads of old ones: there's very little new under the sun. The transformation of previously-likeable characters into irritating characters continues. Lorna is particularly annoying.

There was quite a bit of potential though: several of the ex-inmates are now on the outside, so you get to see how the US deals with ex-cons. This was reasonably interesting, as you see how badly ex-cons are treated by the system and how the odds are stacked in favour of them going back to jail. Unfortunately, the central character in this is Piper, and she's irritating, as always.

The other area that had potential was the sub-plot involving deportees and ICE, as this shows how the US treats illegal immigrants (short answer: not very well). Unfortunately, the writers ruin this by massively overegging the pudding: extreme cases, out-of-the-blue soapbox speeches and political finger-pointing. Rather than address the issues with sensitivity and subtlety, they're rammed down your throat. So preachy.

Season 7 was quite an ordeal to get through. I only put myself through it to see the series through to the end. Even then the writers don't make it easy: 13 episodes with a 1.5-hour final episode! In total that's about 14 hours of my life wasted.

"Such a deeply moving, painfully beautiful show. It may have some slow points but it is utterly worth committing from start to end. I've never seen a show do such a wonderful job in their character development and allowing you to see how human every individual is. Often a sharp reminder of the current political climate we live in, and how privilege wins out, even in prison. The power dynamics and complex relationships are so well-written. Hands down, would recommend any day."
"This show is a seriously funny drama.

If you like 'Weeds', 'Breaking Bad' or prefer your humour on the darker side, then give it a go... you will not be disappointed.

Very few people create characters like Jenji Kohan... and it is the characters that make this show. Like 'Weeds', 'Orange' is fresh and original, and like 'Weeds' the lead character is tragically flawed and hilariously funny.

Well done to Netflix on their latest production... 'Hemlock Grove' is just weird, 'House of Cards' was hit and miss... but it looks like the third time is a charm. Bravo.

(FYI: humour is how we Brits spell humor). :-)"
"The first seasons were good, fun, addicting. But what happened?! Especially season 6, like wth I can't even... This bs 'war' between Carol and Barb?! No one gives a sh*t and it was too childish for words. And not to mention this awful annoying character 'Badison'. From her face, her background story to her freakin' annoying way of talking: I think most people hated her to the core.

Also, most of the original cast disappeared. And of the ones who remained: Piper and Alex' lovestory became boring a long time ago, and what was the role of Flaca even?! Doing some radioshow that wasn't even funny? I was glad Blanca got a bigger role tho, she's always been funny as hell :)"
"It brings back memories of Weeds. You know in its glory days. The first few seasons before it went off the rails. That's what ""Orange Is the New Black"" is like. Equal parts funny and sad. A mix of true pathos and yet true honesty and beauty coming from the strangest places. Be warned however there is plenty of lesbian sex and if the ""F"" word makes your ears bleed it is probably a good idea to turn back now...This isn't OZ but this also isn't Disney. This is a true winner from Netflix and tells an interesting story not only from the main character's perspective but from the other inmates as well. It would have been boring to see things from just her point of view. Like Nancy Botwin on Weeds, sometime Piper Chapman is portrayed in not so good a light because she can be the villain in someone else's story."
"Season 5 is the perfect example of when the show needs to be over. First 2 seasons were amazing, then we saw a gradual decline in good storytelling. And season 5 has no common thread, all the old characters are not even given a chance to shine. The show seems very disconnected, too many ideas never form into anything interesting. Please let it be the last season because it's borderline embarrassing. Pass the word to American Horror Story, and the new Twin Peaks."
"The longest series I have ever watched which was close to 90 hours.

Initially I was not interested in watching the series because of nudity, drug, sex, profane language content; but as the episodes moved on I found it interesting because of the portrayal of all the characters.

The story baseline is the prison life and crimes inside the prison. The episodes revolve around how each of the characters are doing good in their life and they end up in prison life doing some mistake.

I really liked the way they used contrasting short flashbacks for depicting how malice each and every prison inmate are on one side and on the other side how soft-cornered they are to their dear people and how one selfish act of them ended them in prison life.

They have shown how miserable and hard, prison life is amidst the corruption and the politics on the prison administration.

On top of all what made it more catchy was the frequent usage of drama and humour in the scenes."
"Netflix bats it out of the ballpark again with another original, intelligent comedy from the Jenji Kohan, the incredible writer who brought us Weeds! I was hooked from the moment it opened. I wasn't familiar with Taylor Schilling, but I am now a big fan. She's totally charming as the lead and there's a lot of heat between her and fiancé, Jason Biggs. The inmates are a crackup. It's inspiring to see a bunch of women who aren't the same clichés we've seen over and over again. In Orange is the New Black, Kohan pushes the boundaries in the same way she did with Weeds. She somehow manages to make her female leads into adorable victims of circumstance, even if they are criminals. I enjoyed Weeds to the very end. Can't wait to see how this series unfolds!"
"Jenji Cohan does it again. This show covers the life of an innocent minded girl going through the troubles of fitting in to one of the worst places to be, prison. Throughout her sentence she learns the do's and don't's. she finds living her suburban lifestyle wont work. just like our favorite drug dealing mom, Nancy Botwin, she learns quickly and not always efficiently. It does a great job of entertaining through laughs and a few cries. Great casting and writing. If you enjoyed weeds then I highly recommend watching this. The best (or worst) part is that you can watch all 13 episodes whenever you want if you're subscribed to Netflix instant. I can almost guarantee you will fall in love with piper Chapman. You will laugh and cry with her as she tries to make it through her sentence."
It's really sad to see a good show go this way. It has now turned into a b grade sitcom with bad acting.
"Netflix has been in the spotlight recently with their releases of both House of Cards and Arrested Development in full seasons. After finishing both I couldn't wait to see what else they had lined up and once I heard that Jenji Kohan was on board I was sold. Being a fan of Weeds I expected nothing less than well written strong female roles and tons of F-bombs being dropped to come from Kohan's next project. Orange is the new Black is about Piper Chapman and her untimely sentence to an all female penitentiary. She must deal with adapting to her new prison life while also having to maintain a relationship outside with her recent fiancé. I had just finished the first season and was taken back and how well so many of the characters were developed in just 13 hour long episodes. In the beginning it does feel like the show doesn't quite know it's own tone, but just around 4 episodes in it becomes a fun drama with plenty of unique characters. A definite recommendation to anyone who is looking for a summer series to watch!"
"Outside of ""Breaking Bad"", ""Game of Thrones"", and ""Walking Dead"", this is the best show right now. What great character development. Jenji Kohan got it right this time. Kohan's other project, ""Weeds"", started out a really good show for the first two seasons, then just started to feel forced and ridiculous- you also kept losing empathy for the protagonist. The protagonist on this show has much more promise, and all of the characters are mysterious but round in their development. The flashbacks provide a much broader understanding of their history and what drives them, similar to ""Lost"", which mostly proved effective.

There is a lot of humor provided in Kohan's new series, but the humor is more based in reality, as opposed to the unbelievable goofiness that eventually ensued on ""Weeds"". I applaud Schilling and Mulgrew for their amazing work on this show, and Jason Biggs provides the adequate amount of comic relief just when it's needed most. The only criticism of the show would be Laura Prepon. Like in everything she does, she falls completely flat and doesn't add any real tension to the show, which is the only point of her character- that was a complete miscast. Aside from that, this is a close to perfect dramedy.

Netflix is really starting to step it up and give the big paid cable networks a run for the their money. Good- HBO and Showtime need to get with the times and create stand-alone programming outside of cable providers- they deserve to lose customers for that and Netflix is starting to pave the way with shows like ""Orange is the New Black"" and ""House of Cards""."
"Hated the latest season, couldn't even finish watching it! Some of the characters are really good and nuanced. The last season seemed to be going nowhere & similar plots just going round in circles. I hated watching one character fall in love with her rapist so not good to depict that. Too much normalising of porn, even tho in reality so few women watch it. Too much objectification of both men and women. Though I was glad to see nudity featured all sorts of body types and not always in a sexualised way."
"The original story was very new, interesting, creative and had a new angle, because firstly the story was about female prisoners and secondly the main character is not a professional criminal or a thief and this makes the series interesting.

The events that happened in different seasons showed us what hardships the system imposes on the prisoners and what kind of racism exists.

The relationship between the prisoners and how they spend time together, as if they are always fighting and have more problems among themselves, was also thought-provoking.

Piper's daily life and personal life was fascinating to me and she was a lovable character and the changes that prison brought on her were shown very well.

Going into the lives of some prisoners and showing them before they were imprisoned was one of the positive points of the series.

The end of the series created a new kind of feeling after all those seasons and being in prison, which was necessary and good."
